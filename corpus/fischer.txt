The Immortal Witness

Be a scribe! Engrave this in your heart So that your name might live on like theirs! The scroll is better than the carved stone. A man has died: his corpse is dust, And his people have passed from the land. It is a book which makes him remembered In the mouth of the speaker who reads him.1

`In the mouth of the speaker who reads him', intoned the Egyptian scribe who, about 1300 BC, appreciated that `to read' meant `to recite'. For most of written history, reading was speaking. People had earlier realized that verbal instructions, agreements and tallies could easily be garbled, disputed or forgotten. A special witness had been needed, an `immortal witness', who could recall aloud amounts and commodities without error, who could be questioned at any time to confirm facts verbally and stop disputes. And so writing was born, at first blush the human voice turned to stone. When city-states expanded into kingdoms, demands on writing increased exponentially, necessitating ever more complex forms of written documentation ­ each time intended to be read aloud. Reading has always been different from writing. Writing prioritizes sound, as the spoken word must be transformed or deconstructed into representative sign(s). Reading, however, prioritizes meaning.2 The faculty of reading has, in fact, very little to do with the skill of writing. What is reading, then? The answer is not simple, as the act of reading is variable, not absolute. In its most general modern definition, reading is of course the ability to make sense of written or printed symbols. The reader `uses the symbols to guide the recovery of information from his or her memory and
11

subsequently uses this information to construct a plausible interpretation of the writer's message'.3 But reading has not always been this. Initially it was the simple faculty of extracting visual information from any encoded system and comprehending the respective meaning. Later it came to signify almost exclusively the comprehending of a continuous text of written signs on an inscribed surface. More recently it has included the extracting of encoded information from an electronic screen. And reading's definition will doubtless continue to expand in future for, as with any faculty, it is also a measure of humanity's own advancement. Just like our five senses, reading involves something wonderfully unique, as the following paradox will illustrate.4 Jones has taught himself to read Greek letters, but hasn't learnt Greek yet. Andropolis grew up speaking Greek, but has never learnt Greek letters. One day Andropolis gets a letter from Greece, and has Jones read it to him. Jones can voice the letters, but cannot understand; Andropolis can understand, but cannot voice the letters. Who, then, is actually reading? The answer: both together. Reading is not merely the attaching of sound to grapheme, which occurs only at an elementary level. Meaning is involved, and in a fundamental way. At a higher level of perception reading can even convey meaning alone, without any recourse to sound. Therein lies reading's sense-like magic. The multiple processes of reading, as the eminent British linguist Roy Harris has affirmed, `must inevitably be relative to particular cultural purposes, and depend on the contrasting modes of oral rendition which a particular culture may have institutionalized'.5 Hence, what we judge to be `reading' in the past is usually an arbitrary comparison based on what reading means to us today. Such a retrospective judgement is invalid, because throughout history reading has been many different things to many peoples. Its origins are ancient. Reading appears to be superficially and parasitically coupled to such primeval cognitive scanning processes as tracking, weaving, tool-making, berry gathering, face and gender recognition and many others, whereby a flood of visual data ­ shapes, units, patterns, orientation, sequencing ­ is assessed at a glance.

Specialists in communications recognize five phases of information exchange: production, transmission, reception, storage and repetition. When writing is present in a society, these five occur either aurally (one is read to), as in spoken discourse, or visually, incorporating the sense of sight (or, with the blind, touch). Reading is frequently a synæsthetic process: that is, it often combines the two senses of hearing and sight. However, most significantly, hearing is habitually bypassed, leaving reading reliant only on sight (or touch). Consequently, two conflicting theories of reading obtain. The first, supported by those who believe reading to be an exclusively linguistic process, sees reading as a phonological (relating to the sound system of a language) linear process that occurs letter by letter, linking language's elements into ever larger comprehensible units, until first utterance and then understanding are achieved. The second theory, endorsed by those who hold reading to be a visual semantic process, maintains that the grapheme or graphic form ­ whether logogram (word sign), syllabogram (syllabic sign) or a combination of letters (signs in an alphabetic system) ­ yields meaning without necessary recourse to language. Whole words and phrases, even short sentences, can be read `at one go', the proponents of this theory maintain; one doesn't have to deconstruct them into individually sounded-out letters. Yet both theories are correct, in that each obtains at a different level of reading competence and/or activity. That is, elementary reading is indeed a phonological linear process, whereas fluent reading is a visual semantic process. Others have argued that early historical reading in particular was `a matter of hearing the cuneiform, that is, hallucinating the speech from looking at its picture-symbols, rather than visual reading of syllables in our sense.'6 This theory of `aural hallucinating', however, defies both laboratory evidence and the known history of writing: both `ear' and `eye' demand equal acknowledgement in any responsible theory of early reading. This is because the act is in reality a highly complex, multi-level, cerebral process requiring fundamentals and higher-order units simultaneously. Learning to read appears to be a separate activity from fluent reading, to be sure. But as fluent reading frequently
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 13

requires recourse to learning stratagems ­ when reading an unfamiliar or foreign word, or a different hand, type, script or even entire writing system ­ so, too, does learning to read require recourse to advanced visual stratagems in turn, in order to internalize patterns. In this way, two different types of reading have apparently always obtained: literal or mediate reading (learning), and visual or immediate reading (fluent). Everyone begins with mediate reading, putting sound to sign. Most learners then progress to immediate reading, putting sense to sign directly, then advance to larger sign groupings (phrases or even short sentences). After several exposures to a word or sign-combination, a reader comes to form a direct pathway between sign and sense, bypassing sound altogether. Only this explains most of what we find with fluent adult reading. Frequent readers always become fluent readers, who then minimize sound and maximize sense. For want of longer texts and a reading audience, reading as we know it today did not exist before classical antiquity. The earliest readers sighted the notched stick or the dictated tally, the oral made visible. Very few people had cause to learn to read: only those who wished to verify an account, check a label or identify an owner's mark. In time, scribe-reciters intoned dockets, letters, legal documents, pæans and dedications. Antiquity's great clay and papyrus archives eventually appeared, though first and foremost to oversee and authenticate accounts and contracts and to prompt the memory of those who recalled the greater oral story. During its first three millennia, the `immortal witness' was the spoken word incarnate.

the first readers
The further one looks back into the past, the more difficult reading becomes.7 Primitive recording systems comprised codes known only to a small group of practitioners. For the most part, ancient `literature' conveyed only what could be learnt by heart. Reading and writing did not exist as
14 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

autonomous domains of activity. They were minimal appendages to speech. Ambiguity abounded. Decoding of mnemonics (memory aids) and graphics (pictorial displays) can also be regarded as `reading', albeit in a primitive sense.8 Both Neandertals and early Homo sapiens sapiens read notches on bones signalling something that was meaningful to them ­ perhaps a tally of game, days or lunar cycles. Cave art was `read', too, as graphic stories bearing meaningful information. Primitive tribes read lengthy picture messages on bark or leather that could convey great detail. In many earlier societies tally sticks were read to learn amounts. Signalling allowed symbolic messages to be read over a distance: flags, smoke, fired powders, reflections from polished metals and other devices. The Incas read the colour-coded quipus knots to keep track of complicated mercantile transactions. Ancient Polynesians read string and notch records in order to chant their generations. All such `readings' involved predetermined codes. They conveyed a known significance ­ whether an action (as in cave art), numerical value (as in tallies and knots) or spoken name (as in notches and strings) ­ without fulfilling, however, the criteria for complete writing. In its most general sense, writing is the `sequencing of standardized symbols (characters, signs or sign components) in order to graphically reproduce human speech, thought and other things in part or whole.'9 Because this is a limiting definition of something that defies limitation, the wonder of writing, it might be preferable to use `complete writing' instead as a working model, understanding this to comprise the fulfilment of three specific criteria:
· Complete writing must have as its purpose communication; · Complete writing must consist of artificial graphic marks on a durable or electronic surface; · Complete writing must use marks that relate conventionally to articulate speech (the systematic arrangement of significant vocal sounds) or electronic programming in such a way that communication is achieved.

t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 15

Complete writing was a long time coming. For thousands of years, people used indexical symbols to record quantities: five pebbles for five sheep, for example, with each pebble `read' as one sheep. As early as ten thousand years ago, the Azilian people of France were painting crosses, stripes and other designs on pebbles to be read as a code for something, the meaning now lost. Small clay tokens or counters of various geometrical shapes, bearing lines, crosses, circles and other designs, were read for some eight thousand years in the Middle East in a rudimentary bookkeeping system, each token representing one of the given commodity, its design identifying its kind. In time, such chit-like counters in Mesopotamia were being enclosed in special clay `envelopes' called bullæ, the outside of which bore the same token design to identify, at a glance, commodity; it also held a sequence of dots or lines to signal amount. Eventually, clay tablets conveyed similar bookkeeping, also using readily identifiable graphic symbols to represent these and other things. Over time, the pictograms became standardized and abstract, but retained their phonetic value. A paradigm shift occurred when Sumerian scribes began using systemic phoneticism: that is, they systematically coordinated sounds and symbols (including pictograms) to create `signs' of a writing system. A design no longer signified a real commodity, like a sheep, but stood for a specific sound value instead. It was Sumer's conscious exploitation of the phonographic in the pictographic that turned incomplete writing into complete writing. Reading in its true form emerged when one started to interpret a sign for its sound value alone within a standardized system of limited signs. Whole texts, and not just isolated words, could now be conveyed, meaning that reading was no longer a one-to-one transfer (object to word), but a logical sequencing of sounds to recreate a natural human language. Rather than reading pictures, one now read language. The three criteria for complete writing were now fulfilled. Sign became sound ­ freed from its system-external referent ­ in Mesopotamia between 6,000 and 5,700 years ago. The idea soon spread, west to the Nile and east to the Iranian Plateau and even to the Indus, where different languages and different social
16 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

needs demanded other graphic expressions. Everywhere, writing was recognized to be an invaluable tool for accumulating and storing information: it facilitated accounting, material storage and transport, and it retained names, dates and places better than human memory ever could. All early `reading' involved very simple code recognition, and was invariably task-orientated.

mesopotamia
Reading long remained a very primitive tool in Mesopotamia. The world's first active readers sighted only a bare skeleton of text (name, commodity, amount), the control of which served to empower an oligarchy. Sumerian writing developed `not to reproduce a pre-existent spoken discourse but to commit to memory concrete bits of information'.10 This soon led to classifying reality in useful lists made up of nouns (proper names and commodities), adjectives (qualities), verbs (actions) and numbers arranged in easily comprehensible columns, themselves bearing meaning through their orientation. `Reading' entailed logically putting together bits of connected information, not reconstituting articulate speech. Though the very earliest readings were perhaps of incomplete writing, these were none the less `complete readings'. For unlike writing, reading is not bound to language: reading is foremost visual (not oral) and conceptual (not linguistic). Whereas Egypt codified its hieroglyphic and hieratic signs early on, and so fossilized its writing system, for many centuries Sumer maintained a loose and ambiguous inventory of about eighteen hundred pictograms and symbols.11 Simplification and conventionalization occurred, and by 2700­2350 bc, with the tablets of Shuruppak, the inventory had been reduced to about eight hundred, with greater use of linearity (writing in lines of text). By roughly 2500 bc nearly all the graphic elements in Sumer's writing system had become sound units. And by 2000 bc only about 570 logograms were in everyday use.12 Wedges had replaced the earlier pictograms, now impressed by a reed stylus (a pointed writing instrument) into soft clay. The wedges became stylized, eventually losing identifiability. Most

Mesopotamian reading occurred in this cuneiform or wedgeshaped writing in clay, though cuneiforms were also carved in stone and inscribed on wax, ivory, metal and even glass. Very seldom, however, was cuneiform written in ink on papyrus, as scribes customarily wrote in Egypt. Mesopotamians read, then, foremost a `literature of clay'. Because of this, the physical act of reading was frequently problematical: to remain wieldy, clay tablets had to be palm-sized, obliging miniature texts. `To read' was Sumerian s ita (s it, s id, s ed), meaning also `to count, calculate, consider, memorize, recite, read aloud'. Very few in Mesopotamia could ever achieve this faculty. Around 2000 bc at Ur, the region's greatest metropolis with a population of around 12,000, only a small proportion ­ perhaps one out of a hundred, or about 120 people at most ­ could read and write. From 1850 to 1550 bc the Babylonian city-state of Sippar, with approximately 10,000 inhabitants, housed only 185 named `scribes' (that is, official tablet writers), ten of whom were in fact women.13 It appears from this and similar statistics elsewhere that no more than at most a few score literates were alive in Mesopotamia's city-states at any given time. Unless it was one of those rare, palm-sized, literary editions with its miniature text, a clay tablet was a large and ponderous thing, quite ill suited to leisurely reading. From this near-universal failure of Mesopotamian scribes to elaborate a more user-friendly literature, one can deduce that reading was predominantly work. That is, it was not a solitary, agreeable, silent business ­ but public, taxing and loud. The written word very often served simply to prompt the retrieval of a text earlier learnt by heart. For all Mesopotamian literature, even written literature, was public and oral. Writing was still a means to an end, the public performance, a tradition stretching back tens of thousands of years, and not yet an end in itself: the solitary confrontation with the written word. Tablets `spoke' for those whose seals were impressed on them. Judges in Babylon, for example, could speak of a tablet's contents as its `mouth', could publicly assert they had `heard' the tablet (in a way very similar to how today's judges regard affidavits).14 There was no contesting, no challenge by witnesses in attendance; denying one's seal brought severe
18 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

punishment. The written voice was the actual voice. For oral and written literature were one. By around 2500 bc then, or some three hundred years after the East Semitic Akkadians had invaded Sumer and risen to prominence, cuneiform script was complete and capable of conveying any and every thought in the Sumerian language, which the Akkadians continued to use (much as later Europeans preserved classical Greek and Latin). Essential in this process was the establishment, by convention, of a syllabary. This is an inventory of systematic signs used purely for their syllabic sound values: ti, mu, sa and so forth.15 In this learnable system the Sumero-Akkadian reader-reciter then declaimed the treasury of his, and also her, `native' literature. The entire Babylonian tradition is conveyed in these two languages: Sumerian and Akkadian. Many texts comprise lexical and grammatical compilations, displaying how involved the society was in fusing the two traditions in order to preserve the ancient legacy and to ensure continued understanding of ancient texts. Written until about ad 100, in its closing centuries Akkadian was mainly used as a literary, not a spoken, language. (As a spoken tongue, it competed with, and merged into, Babylonian and Assyrian, considered by some scholars to be linguistically distinct stages of evolved Akkadian.) The great Assyrian Empire, which, between 721 and 633 bc, stretched from Egypt to the Persian Gulf, used Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform writing to perpetuate the same traditions, which neighbours borrowed and adapted. Between approximately 550 and 350 bc Old Persian scribes used cuneiform writing, too, but in order to convey their IndoEuropean language with some 40 signs of both syllabic (ka) and phonemic (/k/) values.16 The Old Persian script is found in a small number of royal inscriptions, the longest and most important of these being the trilingual monument of Darius I (c. 550­486 bc) at Bisitun, western Iran:
Says Darius the king: If you look at this inscription or these sculptures, (and) do not destroy them (but), as long as there is strength to you, you care for them, may Ahuramazda ¯ be 17 friendly to you.
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 19

From the beginning, the physical form of reading material had been dictated by immediate purpose. The length of an early Mesopotamian text depended on a clay tablet's size, format, dimensions and `cartouches' (oblong figures enclosing significant units, like names). Early tablet compartments yielded later to horizontal lines, with writing on both sides of the tablet. The first literature (not accounting records) comprised square or oblong clay tablets around one finger-length in size, designed to fit comfortably in the reader's palm. A `book' comprised several of these, possibly stored in a wooden box or leather pouch in a given order for sequential retrieval. Public proclamations, laws and aggrandizing propaganda, such as royal funerary inscriptions, were often stone or clay texts of grandiose proportions, many to be consulted for reference (much as we use a public or corporate library today). In the twelfth century bc at Assur on the Tigris, for example, the Middle Assyrian Code of Laws, inscribed in columns on both sides, loomed in stone over six square metres in size, its public prominence bespeaking authority, its text more feared than read.18 Who did read, then? Scribes, mostly. However, school tablets have emerged out of the ruins of most of the wealthier residences of Ur. Apparently an ability to read penetrated to the Mesopotamian domestic domain as well, though it is unclear exactly to what extent this obtained.19 It is possible that the ability to read and write, already in the third millennium bc, was one of the distinguishing qualities of the aristocracy. Perhaps this ability helped to define the aristocracy as a distinct class. If so, then reading and writing would have experienced wide emulation. A Sumerian scribe doubtless possessed a great sense of responsibility for this highly valued faculty, knowing it was his or her interpretation of a written text that publicly settled a dispute over accounts or an article of law. The goddess of scribes, Nisaba, had as her symbol the stylus, as it was the act of recording that embodied the scribe's primary role, not the act of reading-reciting. This tells us that a scribe was foremost the notary public of his and her era, the notarial stenographer of most of society's important activities, the executive secretary, the governmental bureaucrat.
20 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Of course reading as we know it today played no role in this vital business of state. From grain shipments to temple tributes, from simple messages to lengthy accolades, the everyday complexity of town life was enabled by these reciting scribes ­ and everywhere oral communication took precedence. The written word was still not a voice that existed for itself. (This phenomenon emerged in the fourth century bc, in Greece; see Chapter 2.) For thousands of years, reading was a medium; it was not yet a channel. It is for this reason that we hear the author's precise instructions to the scribe in most Mesopotamian letters: `To My Lord, say this: thus speaks So-and-so, your servant'.20 The scribe could not separate, as we do today, oral instruction from oral message. Scribal duty actually forbade such separation ... as it protected the scribe from potential litigation. But scribes were not exclusively notaries, stenographers, accountants, archivists, secretaries and bureaucrats. They were also active readers whose non-literate superiors or patrons ­ whether architect, astronomer, merchant or priest ­ regularly bade them read aloud, either out of duty or for a small fee. If hyperopic (far-sighted, as most men over 45 tend to be), the scribe could use a pair of hollow reeds, held in one hand, to help focus his eyes to make out the often excruciatingly tiny cuneiforms on the small tablet cradled in the palm of the other hand. A clear drinking glass filled with water might have helped also, the small tablet positioned behind it to magnify the minute wedges. Reading these scribes' ancient correspondence today, in translation, opens up to us an exotic and inscrutable world, one surprisingly filled, though, with familiar human emotions and weaknesses. Like the merchant Nanni's dictated letter to his business associate Ea-nasir in Ur around 1700 bc:
You did not do what you promised me. You put ingots that were not good before my messenger and said: `If you want to take them, take them; if you don't want them go away!' What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me in such a fashion? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to reclaim my money, but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty handed several times. . .
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 21

Take notice that from now on I will no longer accept any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall henceforth select the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.21

To become a professional scribe in Babylon in 1700 bc, boys had to attend, from age six to 18, scribal school from early morning to late afternoon for 24 days in every 30.22 Here they learnt to read and write defunct Sumerian and their native Akkadian, as well as history, mathematics, religious literature and the preparation of legal contracts, one of the principal activities of their chosen profession.23 Though reading and writing formed a large part of the curriculum, much of the material remained oral, neither written down nor read. Indeed, the vast majority of Babylon's social knowledge was transmitted orally and was never committed to clay. From unearthed tablets it has been possible to reconstruct the scribal schools' method of teaching reading. Reading was learnt through the act of writing. First the teacher covered one side of a small tablet with a sign, whereupon the pupil wrote the same sign over and over again on the reverse. Then two signs were paired to form a complete word, which the pupil similarly reproduced. In an Akkadian school, for example, the word ana (`to') was split into two separate syllables using the signs a and na. (The writing system, a syllabography, allowed only this conventional pairing; that is, there existed no separate signs for ana or an-.) In the third stage the pupil studied a proverb, short sentence or list of names, then reversed the tablet and reproduced this, too. In reversing the tablet, the pupil was being forced to visualize the text in order to rewrite it. Above all else, visualization, transcending mechanical imitation, enabled the pupil to become an independent reader and writer ­ it etched the signs and their permissible combinations into memory. Yet one had to have a visual inventory not only of individual signs, but also of whole words, names, phrases, even complete sentences. (This was indeed a form of the same `whole-word' method of learning to read that was rediscovered by Western educationalists in the eighteenth century ad.)
22 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Once a professional, the scribe could look forward to a life of mostly documenting transactions. In particular this entailed financial exchanges, which required exact transcription of the oral agreement and the official witnessing (the `notarization') by the scribe himself or herself. Other successful graduates became bookkeepers and accountants for merchants, shippers or royal temples (where visitors often received receipts for their offerings). Especially gifted graduates, those commanding difficult mathematics, became highly respected surveyors. Drop-outs and failures could still become respectable letter-writers and letterreaders, who were always in demand under their awnings in nearly every town and village market. Unlike today, scribes were seldom their society's creative writers: all creative literature remained oral. Such orally composed works were, however, sometimes preserved on clay by a scribe, on command or request. Nearly all Mesopotamian pupils were boys, the ones expected to assume the family responsibilities or allowed to become professional scribes. However, there were rare exceptions (as with Sippar above). Significantly, the first author in history who signed a work was a woman: Princess Enheduanna, daughter of King Sargon I of Akkad. Born c. 2300 bc, she composed, as High Priestess of Nanna, god of the moon, a series of songs in praise of the goddess of love and war, Inanna, duly recording her own name as author-scribe at the end of her tablets.24 This, however, was something exceptional. In ancient Mesopotamia it was customary for a scribe to record in a colophon ­ a closing inscription giving peripheral information ­ his (sometimes her) name, location and date of writing, as this officially verified the oral transmission. For readers were not yet `reading a text', but still hearing the voice of a scribal colleague who needed identification. Most Mesopotamian colophons end with the maxim `Let the tutored instruct the tutored, for the untutored may not see',25 meaning that as only few command reading and writing, their social responsibility is profound and should not be forgotten or taken lightly. Rare archæological discoveries of ancient archives provide perhaps the best evidence of what people were then reading in Mesopotamia.26 During excavations conducted from 1973 to
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 23

1976 at the acropolis of Tell Mardikh, for example, 60 km from Aleppo in north-west Syria, archæologists unearthed the royal palace of Ebla (2400­2250 bc), including nearly seventeen thousand tablets lying in Ebla's administrative sector, audience court and royal archives. The tablets display a wide variety of subjects: history, literature, agriculture, language, but above all finances and economy. Indeed, most address taxes, tributes, state correspondence, caravans, trade missions and reports. It was predominantly the reading of bureaucrats, accountants and clerks; only a small percentage conveyed non-administrative subjects. One can assume, from Ebla's significance, that this typified larger cities' reading material for the era. The Sumerian Uruk iii period (c. 3000 bc) ­ that is, before continuous texts were written ­ had yielded the very earliest readings: `lexical' lists.27 True literary texts were unknown until about 2500 bc under the Akkadians who, at first, wrote only in Sumerian. Literary texts in Old Akkadian itself only began to appear after 2334 bc, under Sargon I.28 These are chiefly hymns to the gods, songs with entreaties for the king, cult dirges and exorcisms of evil spirits. An important Sumerian myth memorialized the journey of the goddess Inanna to the underworld. Akkadian scribes also preserved the Sumerian divine order of the world. The tales of Uruk's kings Enmerkar, Lugalbanda and especially Gilgamesh dominated the epic genre.29 The Sumero-Akkadian writing system conveyed a wealth of oral genres: epic, legal, medical, culinary, astronomical, mathematical, historical, religious, love poems and many more.30 Didactic poetry was particularly `popular' (always a relative term) in ancient Babylon, such as the Akkadian epic of the creation of the world from the era of King Hammurabi (c. eighteenth century bc), glorifying the god Marduk. Such works combine epic and hymn in a rather discordant literary hybrid. Above all, Akkadian literature excelled in prayers and conjurations. About 1000 bc a tone of pessimism infused its literature, as in the celebrated psalm `I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom', which laments the injustice done to the suffering righteous. There was also writing that only supernatural beings were meant to read. During the first millennium bc at the city of Nippur (in today's Iraq), for example, people purchasing clay
24 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

bowls inscribed with Aramaic incantations believed that, through reading the incantations, malevolent spirits would become trapped under the bowls. That is, the writing itself held magical power. It required no human audience. Few Middle Eastern texts earlier than the first centuries of the second millennium bc have survived. The evidence suggests, for example, that most of the oral Gilgamesh poems ­ the great King of Uruk who vainly searched for immortality ­ were not actually written down until c. 1200 bc. Their final recension occurred at the library of King Ashurbanipal (ruled 669­633 bc), the last great ruler of the Assyrian Empire. Most reading of course involved things of the everyday economy, which the era's scribes performed with the ease and efficiency of today's white-collar worker. More than 75 per cent of the 150,000 cuneiform inscriptions so far excavated in Mesopotamia are bookkeeping and administrative records, the earliest of which are mostly simple lists of goods, people, payments and such.31 As with Ebla, all early Mesopotamian centres had `libraries', that is archives and files, not the literary repositories we know today. Such depots of readily accessible information were held to be essential for the proper administration of burgeoning citystates. By the end of the second millennium bc these depots of clay tablets, papyri, wooden boards, bamboo sticks, silk or leather were empowering societies in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Iranian Plateau, the Ægean, the Indus Valley, Uzbekistan/Tajikistan and Central China. As all reading was then aloud, the simile `loud as a library' would everywhere have been appropriate. Sumerians called those who catalogued libraries `ordainers of the universe'.32 Cataloguing a library means fragmenting human experience. All catalogization is subjective and arbitrary, an offence to the written work: that is, to something intrinsically universal and indivisible. This offence has been committed in every epoch, generally in the name of utilitarianism. Since life itself is uncatalogued, reading should be uncatalogued. However, this is impractical. More useful access to information is won only through limiting the limitless, as the earliest literate societies already discovered.
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 25

At his capital, Nineveh, Ashurbanipal of Assyria possessed a cuneiform library that so far has yielded nearly twenty-five thousand inscribed clay tablets. Ashurbanipal revered writing. He was himself literate, a rarity for a ruler at the time. He boasted that he could `read tablets written before the Flood', that is ancient texts which evidently had been preserved for many centuries.33 His declared love of reading shows the veneration literacy enjoyed at this time. Ashurbanipal even sent agents to every corner of Mesopotamia in search of tablets for the palace library. His personal letter to an official named Shadanu is revealing in this regard:
Seek out and bring me the precious tablets for which there are no transcripts existing in Assyria. I have just now written to the temple overseer and the mayor of Borsippa that you, Shadanu, are to keep the tablets in your storehouse and that nobody shall refuse to hand over tablets to you. If you hear of any tablet or ritual text that is suitable for the palace, seek it out, secure it, and send it here.34

In this way Ashurbanipal amassed an uncommonly large library for the epoch. It held an unusually high percentage of ritual writings, too: astrology, omens and incantations ­ that is, resources for understanding, placating and coercing the gods. In his letter Ashurbanipal draws a significant distinction between `tablet' and `ritual text', betraying the acquired importance of devotional reading. But works of mathematics, medicine, astronomy, epic poetry, songs, hymns, bilingual Sumerian-Babylonian dictionaries and many other subjects also found favour. Here, reading is unmistakably appreciated as being a fount of general knowledge and a means to access and direct the divine. (Today, Ashurbanipal's library offers the richest source of reading about the ancient cultures of Sumer, Babylonia and Assyria.) Found on one particular medicinal tablet, most of which was destroyed, was the revelation:
Palace of Ashurbanipal, king of totality, king of Assyria, whom [the gods] Nabu and Tashmetum gave broad wisdom, who acquired sharp eyes: The best of the scribal art, such works as
26 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

none of the kings who went before me had ever learnt, remedies from the top of the head to the toenails, non-canonical selections, clever teachings, whatever pertains to the medical mastery of [the gods] Ninurta and Gula, I wrote on tablets, checked and collated, and deposited within my palace for perusing and reading.35

That is, it was Ashurbanipal himself writing these words, revealing the ultimate purpose of his remarkable collection: `perusing and reading'. Because of his pre-eminence, Ashurbanipal also received correspondence from throughout Assyria and beyond. At the end of one such letter the royal secretary, the one customarily screening Ashurbanipal' s incoming post, encountered the illuminating appeal: `Whoever you are, scribe, who is going to read this letter, do not conceal anything from the King, my lord, so that the gods Bel and Nabu ¯ should speak kindly of you to the King.'36 Again, `read' is understood as signifying `read aloud, recite'. In these early societies, where the written word was the spoken word, the highest integrity was demanded of each scribal secretary. It was with good reason that one of the laws of the Babylonian king Hammurabi demanded death for him who bore false witness, a law targeting primarily scribes, society's chief witnesses. Censorship took place often. This mainly involved effacing what was written on public monuments and on temple and palace walls in order to erase the luminary's memory, the highest form of public disgrace. But texts were altered, too: either directly, by scraping off and rewriting (which was impossible on hard clay tablets, necessitating frequent forgeries), or indirectly, by editing a wholly new text, that is, by `rewriting history'. This occurred with surprising frequency, for many reasons: filial or fraternal hatred, clan rivalry, altered ethic or religion, invasion and other things. Readers of course then read only what the new regime wanted them to read, which was as far from `factual objectivity' (a modern conceit) as the effaced propaganda had been. Ancient reading so frequently displays poignant humanity. The son of one of Hammurabi's high officials wrote to his mother:
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 27

May my father and the gods keep you well. Gentlemen's clothes improve year by year. The son of Adadiddinam, whose father is a mere underling of my father, has received two new garments, but you keep getting upset over just one garment for me. Though you gave birth to me, his mother adopted him; whereas his mother loves him, you do not love me.37

Through this and many similarly moving and enlightening passages we come to appreciate how Mesopotamian reading already encompassed an entire universe of human experience, its poignancy made all the more immediate by our awareness that, in writing's place of birth, the voice and the sign were still one.

egypt
The commonest Egyptian word for reading, s dj, also signified `recite', and it was for this reason that the Egyptian scribe whose words began this chapter wrote of a book being `in the mouth of the speaker who reads him'. Reading in ancient Egypt, too, was doubly oral: not only was writing understood to be visible speech, but all reading was physically performed aloud through a scribe-witness. We read on a cuneiform tablet letter, therefore, sent to Egypt from the Hurrians (an important Near Eastern people in the middle of the second millennium bc): `And Kelia, my messenger, said this word: thus speaking, "Your brother, Nimmoria, the lord of Egypt, made a great gift"'.38 As in Mesopotamia, written correspondence in Egypt was not reading as we know it, but the official witnessing of an oral medium. All letters generally began with the statement, `Say to So-and-so, the king of So-and-so, my brother etc. ...', including the dictator's verbal instructions to the scribe. Here, too, the written word was not an end in itself, but a means to an end, a socially sanctioned medium (not yet an autonomous channel) through which the scribe was permitted to speak on behalf of the person dictating the message. The `true' message lay not in the cuneiform tablet or papyrus missive, but in the ultimate oral transmission: that is, the scribe reading the message aloud to its addressee.
28 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

As early as c. 3300 bc Egypt was already using several hundred logographic (whole-word) `hieroglyphs', written principally in ink on papyrus. The era of papyrus witnessed the rapid rise of urban federations in Egypt that would endure for over three millennia. Reading and writing are not criteria for civilization; indeed, urban activity had obtained in north-eastern Syria as early as 4000 bc, shortly before complete writing emerged. However, Egypt's Upper and Lower Kingdoms, and the Mesopotamian city-states, advanced and thrived, becoming great empires, only after reading and writing had emerged. No direct causal relationship held, of course, but few would dispute the role of reading and writing in stimulating the economic expansion that empowered such events.39 Early Egyptians appear to have appreciated reading's advantages for information access and control better than the Sumerians who had innovated complete writing. This is because the Egyptians, once they had borrowed from Sumer the concepts of logography, phonography and linearity with sequencing of signs, developed and exploited reading and writing much more quickly. One of the Egyptians' most important native innovations (there were several) was acrophony, the use of a sign to represent only a word's beginning consonant: the sign represented n, for example. (In contrast, Sumerian scribes used signs representing whole syllables, not individual consonants.) All Egyptian hieroglyphic writing furnished word `skeletons' to which the reader needed to add only the appropriate vowels, obvious to native speakers from the context.40 As early as the fourth millennium bc Egyptians were reading hieroglyphs on rock faces, slate palettes, funerary stelæ (upright stone slabs with inscriptions), cylindrical seals, jar-stoppers, pottery, ivory tablets, stone club-heads and other things. A frequent use of ink on papyri is presumed already for this earliest period. Most reading in ancient Egypt was not of hieroglyphs, however, which were very time-consuming to carve, incise or paint, but of cursive writing (only much later called `hieratic'). This script had developed as a practical tool for writing commonplace documents, such as letters, accounts, dockets and, later, as of the second millennium bc, literary texts. A simplification of hieroglyphic writing that used the same system, hieratic was read
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 29

almost exclusively on papyrus, though hieratic texts also appeared on stone, wood, plaster, leather, linen cloth, ostraca (inscribed potsherds) and other surfaces. Egyptian readers read either from right to left or from left to right; some texts follow from top to bottom. Right-to-left reading became the `default' direction, if no clear reason existed to choose otherwise. Once formalized between c. 3300 and 2500 bc, hieroglyphs, hieratic writing and their readings remained little changed for well over two thousand years. (Most readers in northern Africa and the Middle East have kept a right-to-left reading direction ever since.) Once a pupil had completed several years of intensive instruction in a special scribal school, the reading of Egyptian hieroglyphic and hieratic texts came to be a relatively undemanding practice, with quality of literacy of course varying greatly (being primarily task-orientated). Perhaps more significantly, papyrus was thin, lightweight, flexible and easily held and stored. One could even combine papyrus sheets and roll them up as a long narrow scroll, needing only simple unrolling in order to read a voluminous text. (Such reading ease was unknown in Mesopotamia, with its unwieldy clay tablets.) The `oldest book in the world' is the Pruss Papyrus, whose texts of the Fifth Dynasty (c. 2500­2350 bc) were copied, in hieratic script, approximately four hundred years later than this. As early as the Third or Fourth Dynasty, however, continuous texts were being written in Egypt. Though in theory the writing system could then be used for nearly any purpose, Egyptian scribes still did not exploit its full capabilities. By c. 2150 bc, at the end of the Old Kingdom, several categories of text were common: private contracts, legal decrees and proceedings, letters, long religious and magical texts as well as `biographical' inscriptions.41 Probably technical writings existed, too, but apparently no intrinsically `literary' texts were yet entrusted to papyrus, wood or leather: the oral tradition prevailed in all genres, keeping writing restricted to documentation, not creative expression. Few Egyptians ever learnt to read. For most of the country's ancient history, probably not more than one in a hundred was literate at any given time. Considering how Egypt's population
30 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

rose from the Old Kingdom's estimated one million to the Greco-Roman era's 4.5 million (when Greek residents comprised the literate majority), perhaps no more than ten to fifty thousand could read in the entire empire.42 These literates comprised the élite, distinguished in their society chiefly, but not exclusively (for most used scribal slaves), by their ability to read and write. They and the scribal sub-élite almost exclusively occupied all administrative offices. Unlike Mesopotamia, Egypt shows no evidence of scribes enjoying substantial careers separate from public office. The village scribe, however, was similarly a respected amanuensis for hire, who provided the 99 per cent of non-literates with the customary access to reading and writing. All Egyptians could, of course, `read' such pictorially reinforced inscriptions as those on the walls of the Temple of Luxor at ancient Thebes, heralding the story of the triumphant charge of chariot-borne archers under Pharaoh Ramesses II against the Hittites in 1300 bc. The average literate himself could probably read little more than simple words here and there in the inscription, perhaps even a few familiar names in recognizable combinations of hieroglyphs.43 The best-known names would be such frequently occurring sign groupings or cartouches as that of Menkheperre`, the prenomen of Thutmose III (1479­1425 bc), which has survived on thousands of scarabs. However, only very few Egyptians, perhaps one out of five hundred or even fewer, could actually read a monumental inscription in its entirety. Because so very few ancient Egyptians could read and write, and those who did exclusively comprised the élite (or their slaves), the faculty was held in extremely high regard. Here, scribes actually occupied a social station much more elevated than that of their Mesopotamian counterparts. As the Egyptian bureaucrat Dua-Khety told his son Pepy four millennia ago while they sailed south along the Nile to a school for scribes:
Set your thoughts just on writings, for I have seen people saved by their labour. Behold, there is nothing greater than writings. They are like a boat on water. Let me cause you to love writing more than [you love] your mother. Let me usher
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 31

its beauty into your sight. For it is greater than any office. There is nothing like it on earth.44

The profession of Egyptian scribe could be `a princely profession', as Dua-Khety further maintained: `His writing materials and his rolls of books bring pleasantness and riches'. Many scribes went on to become palace officials and ministers, among the wealthiest and most powerful men in the empire. Most scribes, however, remained subordinates who carried out the mundane business of the realm. Literacy was necessary for high status, but then the physical act of writing was subsequently most often delegated by those few who had actually attained to that status. Illustrative of this is the polite way of saying `you' in written Egyptian correspondence: `your scribe', that is, the subordinate encharged to read the missive aloud to his literate superior.45 As in Mesopotamia, hyperopic (far-sighted) readers would also have had reading aids. It has recently been argued that the Egyptians might have known of the special properties of glass lenses as early as the beginning of the second millennium bc, when glass production became common along the Nile. It is indeed possible that readers with hyperopia compensated by using disks of polished glass or clear stone. A papyrus scroll held behind a clear drinking glass filled with water would also have been magnified and perfectly legible to any suffering from hyperopia: this would have been common knowledge in ancient times. Many of the glass vessels preserved from antiquity might actually have served reading as frequently as drinking; society's readers, the élite (or their slaves), owned most glass vessels. Almost from the beginning, writing in Egypt served two main purposes: administration and monumental display.46 But apparently for the first half millennium after writing's introduction in Egypt continuous texts were unknown. The earliest written records, indeed the beginning of `history' itself, comprised merely the simple names of regnal years. Because the élite had early seized on writing's social power ­ the bulk of Egyptian reading being administrative, its practitioners society's privileged ­ élite status was wholly identified with literacy.47 (Evidence suggests that later pharaohs themselves were literate,
32 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

something which obtained only rarely in Mesopotamia.)48 Very little of Egypt's wealth of administrative literature has survived, however. What has endured the millennia, primarily architectural or monumental inscriptions, represents only a fraction of what was once written down. It is in no way representative of the majority of ancient reading. Indeed, it is one of history's greatest ironies that this glorious society, which is so identified with writing (that is, with hieroglyphs), whose temples, tombs, monuments and statues veritably brimmed over with writing, enjoyed the fewest actual readers. But public texts were to impress, not to inform. Contemporaries who could actually read them had been their engravers. Inscriptions were written for the centuries, perceived `readers' the future faceless hordes of venerators ­ or so imagined the inscriptions' illustrious authors. This means the Egyptian hieroglyphs that survive today, on mummy coffins, tomb walls, monumental columns and statuary, were probably only seldom, if ever, read in the lifetime of their addressor. They were almost exclusively ostentatious propaganda for the divine as well as the living, and funerary messages to the gods of the afterlife and to the deceased, calling out the magical words to awake the spirit. What was actually read was mountains of administrative papyri, and these have almost entirely vanished. The very earliest Egyptian literary, as distinct from administrative, texts are the Pyramid Texts, hidden in the royal burial apartments.49 These comprise the funerary literature inscribed in pyramid burial chambers of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties. The late twenty-fifth-century bc wall-to-wall inscriptions filling the antechamber of the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara, for example, describe the ruler's perilous journey through the underworld to his rightful place among the gods. The literate thirteenthcentury bc builder of royal tombs, Peshdu, covered the ceiling of his own tomb with the Litany of Re, a holy text celebrating the Sun God's eternal passage between heaven and the underworld. Statuettes depicting the lowest classes ­ farmworkers, labourers and others ­ were incised with the names of the deceased and placed in the graves of the wealthy to serve them in the afterlife. All such hallowed `Utterances', preserving Egypt's earliest
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 33

recorded religious beliefs, memorialize the hereafter, incant against evil and/or perform holy office for the dead, to be read by gods alone, of whom the deceased was seeking inclusion. Comprising a pharaoh's or aristocrat's `passport to eternity', they addressed and permitted no other readers. It was the world's most exclusive college. One preserved text in a nobleman's tomb reads:
You that voyage over the sky, Re and Thoth, take him unto you to be with you, that he may eat of that whereof you eat; that he may drink of that whereof you drink; that he may live on that whereon you live; that he may dwell there where you dwell; that he may be strong wherein you are strong; that he may voyage there where you voyage.50

Similar otherworldly reading included tens of thousands of sarcophagal inscriptions and the ubiquitous Book of the Dead, a papyrus roll given to the deceased to take with him or her into the afterlife. Temple walls, columns and statuary, too, abounded with inscriptions addressing an immortal readership. The Temple of Isis at Philae, for example, every internal surface of which was covered with writing and some design-work, described royal gifts to `immortal witnesses' of a literal ilk. Greater biographical information than mere title strings and captions began appearing on royal monuments only after the Old Kingdom period, and included ethical precepts, marks of royal favour, assertions of social norms and so forth.51 During the Middle Kingdom scribes incorporated outstanding events. Actual literary texts also began to appear: `wisdom' literature, narratives, hymns, medical, magical, mathematical, astronomical and calendrical texts. None was `popular' in the modern sense, of course, for readership was extremely small and socially restricted. One remarkable feature of such ancient Egyptian texts is that most of them were written down in a special form of metre, that is their language patterns were formalized into individual units of two or three stresses each. The New Kingdom heralded literary genres for a wider audience. Many papyri from this era contain love poems and simple stories of folkloric cast.52 Religious texts described rituals of daily
34 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

devotion and supernatural events. There were papyrus rolls of hymns, myths and magical formulas. Works on medicine (including gynæcology and veterinary science), mathematics, history and lexicography (long lists of animals, plants, parts of the body and geographical names as memory prompts) have survived the millennia. As in Mesopotamia, didactic texts were rife, in particular those providing instructions in practical living, such as the `Teaching of King Amenemhet' or the later `Book of Wisdom of Amenemope', extolling modesty and self-control. Famous in this context is the `Conversation of a Melancholic with His Soul', probably ancient Egypt's most profound literary legacy. Numerous writings also describe or praise, sometimes ironically, life at a scribal school. Factual tales, such as the `History of Sinuhe', mixing adventure with worldly wisdom, were very common. In the later Greek era, fiction in particular assumed a special place among Egyptian readers. Dramatic texts for religious festivals surfaced. And everywhere poetic texts, of strict metrical structure, abounded, ranging from work songs to pæans to the gods or pharaoh. (Two significant collections of Egyptian love songs, for example, have survived.) At all levels of society letters were always an extremely important reading material. Around 1500 bc international epistles comprised clay cuneiform tablets small enough to be carried in one hand, such as the Babylonian king Kadasman-Enlil's invitation to Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV), pharaoh of Egypt:
I am going to have a house-warming. Come yourself to eat and drink with me. In attendance shall be twenty-five women and twenty-five men.53

The above belongs to the collection of some 380 letters, covering approximately three decades, discovered in the late 1800s at Tell El-Amarna (ancient Akhenaten). The period of the Amarna Letters, as they came to be called, includes the entire reign of Akhenaten (1353­1336 bc), when Egypt's culture and political power were at their zenith, distinguishing the most powerful kingdom the world had yet known. The letters consist of diplomatic correspondence between the pharaoh and his
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 35

contemporaries in neighbouring lands, as well as his vassals governing cities and towns under Egyptian administration. Each letter follows a strict protocol of diplomatic rhetoric. They often commence with such courteous salutations as:
Say to Nimmureya [Akhenaten], the king of Egypt my brother, my son-in-law, whom I love and who loves me: `Thus, Tushratta, the king of Mitanni, your father-in-law, who loves you, your brother [ally]. For me all goes well. For you may all go well. For your household, for your wives, for your sons, for your magnates, for your chariots, for your horses, for your warriors, for your country and whatever else belongs to you, may all go very, very well'.54

Whereupon the correspondent would customarily follow this with a plea for troops, money, gifts and the like. Or, rarely, quite the opposite. In his letter, Tushratta was announcing his own gift to Akhenaten ... of a concubine:
`She has become very mature, and she has been fashioned according to my brother's [your] desire. And, furthermore, my brother will note that the greeting gift that I shall present is greater than any before.'

Written entirely in cuneiform, the Amarna Letters mostly convey Old Babylonian, the language of diplomacy and trade at this time, the lingua franca of the ancient Near East. For his response, however, the pharaoh would dictate in Egyptian to a scribe who wrote hieratic signs in ink on papyrus. The scribe then passed this along to a royal translator who composed an Old Babylonian version, in turn inscribing this in cuneiform on a clay tablet to be dispatched by a palace courier. The courier would hasten to the addressee's locale, seek admittance, then deliver the tablet to the proper authority, who would then bring the tablet to the addressee, together with a translator if required, and the text of the letter would be read aloud. One of the most poignant letters of the Amarna Period was one sent to King Suppiluliumash of the Hittites by Ankhesenpaaten, Tutankhamun's young widow, who was being
36 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

pressed to wed the 30-year-older designated successor Ay:
My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons. You might give me one of your sons, and he might become my husband. I would not want to take one of my servants [i.e., Ay]. I am loath to make him my husband.

The Hittite king acquiesced. But then his young son was murdered on his way to Egypt, and so Ankhesenpaaten, probably fearing for her own life, condescended to marry Ay. Ancient Egyptian reading was far more than information conveyance: the very spirit of a text was being conveyed as well. Unlike Mesopotamia's utilitarian cuneiform wedges, Egyptian hieroglyphs, in particular, were believed to hold magical power. Reading them on sarcophagi and tomb walls and ceilings was a divine utterance, helping to bring their message into fulfilment. For the same reason, their frequent defacement meant to preclude the lives, deeds and socio-spiritual power of their owners being called back into life again through reading aloud. For reading such things was an act of creation itself. Just as in Mesopotamia, however, Egypt had its assortment of libraries: at palaces, temples, administrative centres and even the private residences of wealthy literates. From Edfu has come a catalogue of catalogues, dating from c. 2000 bc, revealing how ancient Egyptian librarians, too, were attempting to define their world of experience with such categories as `The List of All Writings Engraved in Wood', `The Book of Places and What Is in Them', `The Book of What Is to Be Found in the Temple' and many more.55 Over the millennia Egypt arrived at transmitting noteworthy written texts in generally accurate copies. The most prestigious were probably narratives and didactic writings; these maintained a well-defined structure in a distinctly `non-oral' style (usually that of brief epithets, to be read aloud in a form of metre). Of similar importance were Egyptian magical texts; these were very widely read, the spells' efficacy dependent on the accuracy of their copyists. None the less, ancient Egyptians never achieved a discursive or analytic history, never implemented a religious
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 37

canon or exegesis (such as Judaism, Christianity or Islam were later to implement through reading). There was neither an indigenous oral epic nor scripture. Egyptians remained in a common intermediate position, their society `aided by literacy but not transformed by it'.56

spreading the written word
The idea, as well as many conventions, of Mesopotamian writing diffused also eastward. For the Proto-Elamite people of the Iranian Plateau c. 3000 bc, reading was actuarial: their longest surviving text, comprising only seven lines, treats of sheep delivered as taxes to the central administration at Susa. Yet five hundred years earlier, people as far away as the Indus Valley were using potters' marks to write names and/or places; this then apparently developed into the (assumed) logosyllabic writing system of the Indus Valley civilization, which thrived between 2500 and 1900 bc. It is probable that the Indus people predominantly wrote on something perishable like leather or wood, which has since rotted away, leaving no trace. Although no literature has survived from this rich culture (that is, no long tablets, papyri or monumental inscriptions), the ubiquity of the many inscribed seals, brief clay and faience tablets, bronze tools and utensils, bone and ivory rods and other things ­ usually bearing two or three signs in a line and five signs in total ­ suggests a restricted and rudimentary `literacy'. In a side room of the northern gateway at the ancient centre of Dholavira was found an inscription comprised of signs more than 30 cm in height: perhaps it was a `public sign' of some sort. Used principally to validate and solidify economic authority, reading and writing in the ancient Indus Valley appear also to have been closely associated with the ruling élite of leading centres, in particular Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.57 By c. 2000 bc, syllabic reading ­ that is, of in-di-vi-du-al syllables ­ was enriching the Semites of Byblos in the Levant, the Luwians of Anatolia (today's Turkey) and the earliest Greeks of the Ægean. In fact, Greeks were Europe's first readers. Their various scripts ­ the Minoan Greeks' `hieroglyphic' script and
38 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Linear A, the later Mycenæan Greeks' Linear B, Cypro-Minoan and, finally, the `Cypriote Syllabic Script' ­ mainly conveyed accounting. However, there were longer readings, such as dedications, contracts and even royal proclamations. This latter use of Ægean writing is evidenced by Crete's celebrated Phaistos Disk, Europe's earliest literature. Unearthed in 1908 and dating from c. 1600 bc, this baked clay disk, 16 cm in diameter with 241 hieroglyphic syllabic signs imprinted on both sides, apparently conveys a `mobilization proclamation' in Minoan Greek.58 The text on the Phaistos Disk is too short to be documentation: a native speaker could easily have memorized its message. As a royal proclamation disk, however, it validated the oral performance in a similar manner to much later Hebrew, Christian and Islamic reading performances, which emphasize the authority speaking through the written word. (Today, though he knows each text by heart the Pope, for example, still chants before an open book.) With the Phaistos Disk, the herald was not so much `reading' as performing a royal act: becoming the voice of (possibly) the Minos of Crete himself. Was there a body of `literature' to read in any of the several Ægean scripts of prehistory? None has appeared so far. It is possible such literature ­ hymns, songs, epic histories in imitation of those of the Greeks' influential trading partners the Canaanites and Egyptians ­ did indeed find written expression, but on perishable leather and papyrus. Certainly only a small handful of people in this early European society could read and write. And the rudimentary libraries at Knossos, Phaistos, Mycenæ, Athens and elsewhere would only rarely have transcended immediate archival requirements. Here, too, `literature' was still perceived as something intrinsically oral. By the fourteenth to thirteenth centuries bc at Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra') in the northern Levant, however, scribes were actively recording myths, legends, rituals, contracts and thousands of bookkeeping records in the local alphabetic script written in cuneiform wedges. And within three hundred years the great age of inscriptions began in Phoenicia, using fully developed consonantal alphabetic writing. But who were the readers of the hundreds of stelæ and other stone monuments erected at Byblos, Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, Ashkelon and other
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 39

coastal centres? For here, too, only very few people could read, perhaps no more than one in a hundred. In point of fact such inscribed monuments were more a show than a practice of reading. The ruler's act of having left a written statement sufficed; it was unnecessary to hear his voice. Power and prestige lay in presence. Aramaic writing developed from Phoenician around the tenth century bc, and by the eighth or seventh century bc Aramaic had become the main language and script of the Near East, the lingua franca of the entire region. Eventually it became the official language of the Persian Empire (550­330 bc). In the sixth century bc, for example, Persia's King Darius, who also left many inscribed monuments, placed in the audience hall at Persepolis two trilingual gold plaques (replicated also in silver) asking the god Ahuramazda ¯ in Aramaic to protect Darius and safeguard his household. As with Egypt's temple and tomb inscriptions, this was reading for gods alone, but now on small portable wealth. Aramaic writing also replaced Assyrian cuneiform: ink on leather or papyrus was now preferred over wedges in soft clay. The Age of Clay was coming to an end, never to return. In the main, Aramaic `literature' similarly comprised official documents, general administration, accounts, bookkeeping, monumental inscriptions and other things. Of crucial importance was Aramaic's inspiration of the writing system of the Indian subcontinent, the first longer documents of which are the famous edicts of King Asoka from c. 253­250 bc, carved on stone pillars or rocks throughout Hindustan.

religion and reading
As the amount of reading and writing increased, everywhere the visually talented displaced the orally talented. (In the West, Middle East and China, this process was essentially complete by classical antiquity.) Religion played an enormous role in this transformation. Throughout history, one of the chief motors of literacy has been religion. Priest-scribes had been among society's first readers. They were followed by élite scholars and then
40 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

by lay celebrants, who, in turn, expanded and diversified their reading material, eventually leading to a concept of general education. It is an illuminating fact in the history of reading that the distribution of writing systems and scripts in the world today `reflects the distribution of the world religions far more clearly than it does the distribution of language families'.59 Because writing is such an effective medium of arresting, preserving and conveying sacred knowledge, able to safeguard verbatim the extended teachings of venerated personalities without human oral mediation, reading and writing of religious literature began to play an ever more salient role in society. In Western Europe, religious literature came to dominate reading for well over a thousand years. (In other parts of the world, particularly Islamic nations, it still dominates reading.) In the first millennium bc readers of religious literature were mainly priests who had trained as scribes. They wrote down oral traditions dictated to them, which they then read aloud at sacred offices. Forming a special élite, they were able to influence, control and steer society by virtue of their unique position. It was at this time that the phrase `for it is written' came to take on authoritative, indeed divine, significance, which lingers with us still. Society's literary readers ­ that is, the same priest-scribes ­ also became commentators. In time, owing to the authority of their authors, the commentaries themselves became scripture: that is, holy writ. A significant amount of the world's religious reading emerged in the last half of the first millennium bc. Buddhism's Pal Canon, for example, deriving from oral tradition and containing the teaching of the Buddha (c. 563-483 bc), was written down in Pali, the canonical language for Buddhists from many countries. As Buddhism developed, comparable texts in other languages flourished, especially in East Asia among the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese. At the same time, Hinduism was being conveyed through a variety of texts known collectively as the Ve ¯ das; written in the Sanskrit language, these were chiefly preserved through a strict oral tradition insisting on accuracy of pronunciation. In fact, most religious writings failed to experience direct veneration. Only the oral tradition was truly venerated. In the West, however, veneration of the written
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 41

texts themselves emerged (see Chapter 2). This custom was institutionalized by the Jews who, many centuries later, inspired early Christians to emulation. Up until the fifth century bc reading was essentially passive. It involved overwhelmingly accounts, tallies, despatches, bills of lading and legal documents and only a very limited amount of literary texts. None integrated the reader as an active interpreter-analyst, but prompted him or her to retrieve simple accounts or information or to recall something that had earlier been committed to memory. Such things as legends, myths, incantations, chants and holy writ were still rarely written down, their veneration reserved for the `real' oral tradition. Preliterates and non-literates were still displaying prodigious oral feats of memory. Such ability had been innate, of course, appearing to be exceptional only to literates who no longer daily exercised humankind's natural oral talents. Oral ability weakens upon accession to literacy. Antiquity's first readers, accountants and bookkeepers, had begun discovering new strengths that then displaced the oral endowment. Favouring visual mnemonics, reading enabled memorization of higher-order structures and facilitated novel categorizing devices or techniques (such as alphabetic listing or acrophonic prompting) that augment the process of mental retrieval. With consonantal alphabetic writing's diffusion from Egypt, Sinai and Canaan, however, reading transcended that monopoly of bookkeeping scribes serving the rich and powerful. No longer requiring many years of intense study at a scribal school, reading could now be practised by all after only a few months of learning a simple alphabet. Its simplicity also invited borrowing by foreign languages, usually requiring only minimal conversion to convey indigenous sounds. In many different countries, people of all ranks and classes now learnt to do their own bookkeeping and to read anything they desired. Humanity's thirst for knowledge and love of learning served as kindling to incipient reading. Perhaps this need, not only to know, but to know more, prompted very early on the passion and respect for reading that was, in time, to overwhelm the globe. Humankind's latest advantage over other creatures has been our
42 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

ability to seek out and organize information. This occurred first through articulate speech, then through writing, then through ever more advanced forms and ways of reading. But literacy is a response; not a stimulus.60 Literacy does not cause social and cognitive change (though it is probably a necessary precondition for some changes). Once larger complex societies rise, literacy can enhance complex organization, primarily by aiding memory and providing access to knowledge (via files, archives, libraries) to a degree no human mind can achieve unaided. Those who read can extend their communication spatially and temporally; they can also expand their memory in compass and duration. Though the early scribes did all this in keeping records, exchanging letters, identifying commodities and even extolling rulers in monumental inscriptions, they seldom distinguished this faculty from oral performance: that is, the skills of the tallykeeper, messenger and herald. The appreciation of reading's real potential began very late in reading's development ­ in point of fact some three thousand years after writing's elaboration in Mesopotamia. With the written word's gifts came also its tyranny. As a result of their voluntary metamorphosis literates lost oral memory, oral culture, oral freedom. An artificial authority, the written word, imposed itself on every literate person: a human-created tyrant enthralling its devoted subject. Today, having entirely lost our oral patrimony, we are quite unconscious of the tyrant's ubiquitous levies as we live, think, believe, revere through the written word, oblivious to a world of other possibilities. We are, all of us, reading's unwitting vassals. Yet most people would accept that this is a small price to pay for one of life's greatest wonders: personal command over space and time. All of history's known languages and cultures endure only through reading, in this way continuing to participate in the human drama as they attest to the glory and struggle of our common past: Sumerian, Egyptian, Akkadian, Persian, Sanskrit, Classical Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Classical Arabic and hundreds more. For, over the millennia, the `immortal witness' eventually became humanity's own voice.

The Papyrus Tongue

At dinner, when my wife is present or a few friends, I have a book read aloud; after dinner a comedy or lyre playing; afterwards a stroll with my people, among whom are erudite individuals. Thus the evening passes in varied discussions, and even the longest day is quickly seasoned.1

The writer and administrator Pliny the Younger (c. ad 62­c. 113), known particularly for his voluminous correspondence, well appreciated reading's place in ancient Rome, at least among the patrician élite. This is because most non-essential reading, during nearly all of classical antiquity, was entertainment and announcement, read aloud by servants or slaves trained in the art. When Emperor Augustus (63 bc ­ ad 14) found it impossible to sleep, for example, he summoned, as his biographer Suetonius (c. ad 75­150) tells us, readers or story-tellers. All classical instruction had as its ultimate goal not so much the acquisition of knowledge as the perfection of eloquence. Greeks and Romans, after their respective archaic periods, certainly used writing extensively. But their daily lives were still dominated by the spoken word. They dictated letters, heard recitations, listened to news, attended their slaves' readings of literature and correspondence. Orality, not literacy, ruled ancient Mediterranean society. What had changed was that, with writing's sudden proliferation, Greeks and Romans of various ranks and classes were reading aloud from hand-held scrolls of papyrus (and from waxed tablets). That is, even masters themselves were now declaiming with a papyrus tongue. Of course, the vast majority of Greece's and Rome's populations lived and died with little or no use, even indirectly, of
45

reading and writing.2 The patricians who did make frequent use of reading and writing typically preferred using others for the task; they themselves, with no incentive to do otherwise, rarely advanced beyond only a rudimentary level of reading competence. From early in Greek and Roman history, daily intimacy with reading and writing certainly approached universality among this ruling élite who sought only `the noblest pursuits' in their readings, as the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (d after 21 BC) professed. But `widespread literacy' existed only secondhand, and among a very small minority ­ that is, the literate slaves who read to their semi-literate patrician mistresses and masters. Three millennia after complete writing's elaboration in Mesopotamia, reading occurred with a variety of materials. The Dead Sea Scrolls reveal that much writing in Middle Eastern isolation occurred on skins, though gold, silver, copper and bronze were also used for exceptional documents. Monumental inscriptions ­ eminently visible today, but rare exceptions in antiquity ­ heralded in stone. Of course the great majority of everyday reading occurred in the form of waxed tablets. Nearly all correspondence and daily minutiæ were recorded on, and read aloud from, these easily erasable surfaces, the raised borders and hard covers of which protected the writing inside. Even entire works of literature appeared in waxed-tablet format. But the king of surfaces was papyrus, imported from Egypt. Greeks had probably already used Egyptian papyrus at Knossos, Mycenæ and other early Ægean centres during the second millennium BC. But then the custom waned. Only around the seventh century BC did numerous Greek merchants and mercenaries, who were making Naucratis in Egypt a thriving centre of Greek commerce, encounter papyrus again on a daily basis. It was not until the Anabasis by the Greek general and historian Xenophon (431­c. 355 BC), however, that papyrus was mentioned by a Greek writer. Up to the mid-fourth century BC the Greeks in Hellas itself, it appears, `lacked a common, inexpensive writing material accessible to all'.3 Early Greeks wrote on whatever was available: potsherds, waxed tablets, skins of every sort, even sheets of gold and silver and thin plates of lead. (Lead was actually prescribed for incantations.) But as such materials were not conducive to easy and compendious
46 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

reading, few longer works were written down. As ever, one relied foremost on human memory. When papyrus became a more familiar, if still extremely expensive, writing material, however, the trade in it suddenly boomed, prompting in turn more reading and writing along eastern Mediterranean shores. Egypt eventually produced huge amounts of papyrus for the Greek and, later, the Roman markets. The demand maintained a complete industry along the Nile, sustaining thousands. Eventually a book trade in papyrus scrolls developed in Rome, with scores of publishers who, in turn, employed hundreds of scribes and illustrators. Still, few could afford to own a book (scroll). Libraries accounted for some sales; otherwise all copies went to extremely wealthy patrons. The prime expense was the papyrus itself: each of the many middlemen involved in its import from Egypt demanded his percentage. Nevertheless, once papyrus became a major trade commodity, books and reading become commonplaces along the Mediterranean, and even beyond.4 The papyrus sheets were joined to form a scroll, which had to be rolled open in order to read. Because of this, the publishing of lengthy works was rather `awkward', at least by our standards. In antiquity Homer's Iliad, for example, probably comprised 24 separate scrolls, as it contains 24 individual books; only much later, with the emergence of codices of individual pages, were such books within one work reinterpreted as individual `chapters'. Similarly awkward was the viewing of a papyrus scroll one sequential frame at a time, like `scrolling' down through today's computer-screen pages. Because of the ancient book's format, a reader naturally comprehended reading as something intrinsically sequential. But this uniquely fitted oral reading, which was necessarily sequential, too. The normally contiguous text (with no word separation, punctuation or upper/lower case distinction) followed the natural flow of oratory. The physical act of reading aloud parses the text into its constituent features, giving meaning to the tongue where no meaning is evident to the eye. Though punctuation was devised early (by Aristophanes of Byzantium, c. 200 BC), it was primarily used in ambiguous cases to distinguish the desired pronunciation and intonation in
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 47

public performance. A universal, standardized punctuation, such as may be used throughout a text in consistent fashion, only became fashionable nearly two thousand years later, after the introduction of printing in Western Europe. Now conveying almost exclusively meaning, not sound, punctuation has become fixed only within the last three hundred years. In an early form of textual separation, scribes wrote per cola et commata (`by clauses and phrases'). St Jerome (c. AD 347­420) was the first who described this method of segmenting a text, having discovered it in old copies of Demosthenes and Cicero, noting it `conveys more obvious sense to the readers'.5 With this, the text is divided into individual lines of coherent meaning, for easier visual recognition. It told the reader either to raise or lower the voice, in order to render sense through proper intonation. As an added advantage it also allowed easier retrieval while searching a text, something hampered by the commonly run-together writing of antiquity. Papyrus scrolls were stored in two ways: in individual round boxes, with each scroll sporting a separate label (Egyptians had had clay labels; Romans preferred papyrus, later parchment, labels), and with separate boxes holding different authors or subject matter; or on open shelves, with identification tags on the end of each scroll. Once parchment became popular by c. AD 400, with codices or bound books replacing papyrus scrolls, these were stored not vertically with spines showing, as we do today, but lying flat on the bookcase. Once learnt, reading cannot be unlearnt, and so throughout antiquity tyrannical rulers who failed to prevent literacy attacked what opponents or suspected foes were reading: the books themselves. From the very earliest days of reading in Europe, too, just as in Mesopotamia and Egypt, critical or subversive, but also introspective or merely philosophical, works of literature fed the flames of fear. In 411 BC Athenians burnt the works of the long-deceased Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras (c. 580­ c. 500 BC). Emperor Augustus banned the works of the statesman and poet Gaius Cornelius Gallus (c. 69­26 BC) and the poet Ovid (43 BC ­ c. AD 17): Gallus, creator of the Roman love-elegy, took his own life rather than quit Rome, whereas Ovid, Rome's most celebrated poet after Horace's
48 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

death, never secured a pardon from his exile in Tomi (today Constant , a, Romania). Livid that their fame was greater than his, Emperor Caligula (ad 12­41; ruled 37­41) decreed the burning of all copies of works by Homer (whose Iliad and Odyssey were the West's most copied books) and two of the deceased literary legends of his era, the Roman poet Virgil (70­19 bc) and Livy (59 bc ­ ad 12), the historian of Rome. (Needless to say, the decree was ignored.) Emperor Diocletian (ad 245­313) ordered all Christian books to be burnt in ad 303, so great was his fear of their challenge to his supremacy. Because local religion had predated the acquisition of the faculty of reading, with reading thus remaining alien to the celebration of the holy offices, reading did not figure at all in the various forms of Greek and Latin liturgy, which remained exclusively oral. Deities are never mentioned or portrayed as readers. As there existed no Greek or Roman `holy scriptures', so, too, were absent myths or depictions of Zeus or Jupiter dictating sacred scrolls, as one finds emerging in Judæa at this time. (After having borrowed writing from the Greeks, the Etruscans in their art, however, depicted several of their gods as either scribes or readers.)6 Even so, among the most cherished possessions of a learned Greek or Roman were books, which comprehended an ardour otherwise reserved only for family, spouse or lover. For many, books were even closer and dearer.

the greeks
Greeks had been reading since c. 2000 BC, when the idea of syllabic writing had arrived in the Ægean from cosmopolitan Canaan. A thousand years later, a consonantal alphabet was borrowed from the Canaanites' descendants, the Phoenicians, prompting the Greek scribes of Cyprus to elaborate a complete consonant-and-vowel alphabet (the way we write today).7 At first Europe's new writing system merely replaced the more cumbersome and ambiguous syllabic writing in order to write accounts, dockets and short correspondence, mainly on skins. But soon it was also written on vases, metals, potsherds and
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 49

other things, the texts growing in length. One of the earliest inscriptions in Greek letters occurs on the Dipylon Jug (c. 730 BC), discovered near Athens's ancient western gate: `to him who dances most delicately'. It is certain that lengthy texts such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were also written down around this time, probably on skins, though the oldest preserved fragments, on papyrus, date only from the third century BC. In Greek anagigno ¯ sko ¯ meant `I read' as well as `I recognize, I read aloud' and, in Ionian Greek, `I convince, I talk (someone into doing something)'. Reading's very definition in Greek still denoted, then, spoken communication, oratory and persuasive rhetoric. In the seventh century BC writing in the West took a decisive turn when Greek law began to appear in monumental inscriptions, endowing writing with a new social status. Surpassing orality, written laws became visible in public architecture for all literates to read aloud and share with others. However, as with the inscribed monuments of Mesopotamia and Egypt, the primary purpose of the public inscription was to be seen, not necessarily to be read. Presence alone bespoke authority. Of course, before 600 BC very few Greeks could read. Literacy proliferated in the sixth century BC when writing began to be used more widely in public and semi-public life: with the increasing custom of inscribing and displaying public laws, the minting of inscribed coins, the inscribing of black-figure vases and other related innovations.8 Though it has been alleged that, by 500 BC, the majority of Athenians, for example, could read the laws that were posted everywhere in their city,9 it is unlikely this obtained: archaic Greece was not a literate society. Certainly the rules governing Athenian ostracism ­ that is, punishment by temporary exile, voted for with an inscribed ostrakon or potsherd ­ suggest that around 15 per cent of the adult male population of Athens, at least from c. 480 BC onwards, had reached the level of semi-literacy, or perhaps even a slightly higher level, since many of these were clearly able to write competently for themselves. From this, perhaps around five per cent, or slightly more, of the total adult population of Athens, including women and slaves, was literate. In other words, about one out of twenty Athenians could probably `read' with varying levels of competence.
50 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

It was at this time, too, because of reading and writing, that the Greek mythic epic became divided in the public consciousness into the historical narrative on the one hand, and the work of `fiction' (a wholly new concept) on the other.10 Already about 700 BC the poet Hesiod had tried to arrange traditional myths in some sort of rational chronological order, one fitting a new appreciation of space and time and their role in the ordering of human perceptions. By the fifth century BC reading was no longer the monopoly of an oligarchy validating herein its power: it was rapidly becoming a `popular' tool for accessing information. The historian and politician Thucydides (c. 460­395 BC) was even trusting written documents more than oral traditions in compiling a chronology and account of past events, founding in the process the discipline of historiography.11 It signalled a paradigm shift in humanity's appreciation of reading's innate power. For one now realized writing could allow accession and retention of many texts, and to a degree that orality could never achieve. Through reading, a person could visually `become' a text and, with increased reading, even a `walking library' of multiple works. Until the end of the fifth century BC poets remained disciples of the Muses alone. But then the grammatikós or `grammarian' commanded the Greek language, knowing how to read and interpret a written text. It was in the lifetime of the philosopher Plato (c. 427­c. 347 BC) ­ the pupil of Socrates (c. 470­399 BC) and teacher of Aristotle (384­322 BC) ­ that the Greek language advanced to the point where one could begin to address abstract concepts adequately for the first time.12 Plato, well aware of what was taking place in Athenian society, documented these revolutionary changes in his celebrated Phædrus dialogue. This was the fascinating story of young Phædrus, at the end of the fifth century BC, demonstrating to Socrates this new ability of how one `became' a work of written literature. Having memorized a written work by Lycias on the duties of a lover (then a favourite theme), Phædrus wished to impress Socrates with its recitation. But Socrates, mistakenly believing Phædrus had hidden the written text under his robes, requested the youth read him the original instead, remonstrating `I won't let you practise your oratory on me when Lycias himself is here
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 51

present!'13 Lycias's work not only dealt with love, but also with the art of writing, leading Socrates to expound:
You know, Phædrus, that's the strange thing about writing, which makes it truly analogous to painting. The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive: but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence. It is the same with written words: they seem to talk to you as though they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything about what they say, from a desire to be instructed, they go on telling you just the same thing for ever. And once a thing is put in writing, the composition, whatever it may be, drifts all over the place, getting into the hands not only of those who understand it, but equally of those who have no business with it; it doesn't know how to address the right people, and not address the wrong. And when it is ill-treated and unfairly abused it always needs its parent to come to its help, being unable to defend or help itself.14

Socrates believed books ­ the objects themselves, not their contents ­ were actually an impediment to learning. There was only one `proper' interpretation of a text, he felt, one shared by those of trained intellect and communicable only by oral transmission. Too much is lost in writing. The voice alone conveys the `one, correct' interpretation. Socrates was demanding from the text the uni-dimensionality of orality that, within the next two generations, the interpretative reader was to transform into multi-dimensionality. Instead of recognizing this revolution in reading, Socrates, insisting on the inherited tradition, simply dismissed all writing. Socrates's position is neither an indictment of reading nor the last stand on the oral society, as some have alleged. It is chiefly a critique on the contemporary inadequacy of Greek writing to reproduce Greek speech, in particular the pitch stress characterizing Greek oratory. Socrates was right: the primitive early writing practices of his era did allow too much ambiguity, hindering communication. Since the beginnings of written speech, readers must interpret, either to retrieve the author's meaning or to understand
52 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

something new. This creative open-endedness simply did not exist in oral society, where meaning was immediate. Socrates wished to maintain the auctorial clarity of orality: it helped to define truth, which was, he insisted, `written on the soul of the hearer to enable him to learn about the right, the beautiful and the good'. One heard the truth; one did not read it. But to maintain orality was to deny reading's potential multi-dimensionality, which was soon to transform all of Western society. Socrates's pupil and biographer Plato endorsed his master's position. Plato rejected written philosophy, even advocating civil legislation to control oral poetry. Yet, as many generations have pointed out, Plato used writing to champion his cause. This has led many to believe that Plato was merely making a hermeneutic or interpretative appeal for writing's `proper' use.15 Plato's many written works attest to a conscious use of the written medium to hone and model thought itself, something quite new in the West: something entirely beyond the capability of oral performance. If Socrates had dwelt wholly in the oral world, his pupil Plato was very much a reader and a writer, despite the public mask. Still, Plato would ban the poet from his ideal republic. This reflected a general distrust of fiction in the West, which lingers still. Fiction is something to be feared, because it represents the unfettered mind, capable of anything. Knowledge is clearly something to be directed for the common good. But fiction, being directionless energy, has always aroused suspicion and invited censure. In actual fact, there were few written texts in Socrates's and Plato's Athens. Writing's full potential as a social tool was yet to be realized. A primitive book trade blossomed in Athens in the fifth century BC. But the private reading of books (papyrus scrolls) seems only to have become relatively `common' in the fourth century BC, the era of Plato's pupil Aristotle, born 15 years after Socrates's death. In contrast to Socrates and his generation, Aristotle became an avid reader. He even amassed a private library that he could use for his scholarship. The fifth to fourth centuries BC marked the transition from the oral to the written tradition (but not the oral to the literate society, the latter being only a very recent phenomenon).
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 53

As Socrates's own pupils Plato and Xenophon used writing to preserve their master's oral teachings ­ including his dismissal of writing ­ so, too, did the new generation of philosophers and physicians, like Hippocrates (c. 460­c. 377 BC), use writing to diffuse new knowledge in a way oral tradition had never done. In time this engendered the creative interpretation of written texts, expanding inherited knowledge's capabilities. The Greek physician, anatomist and physiologist Galen (c. AD 130­c. 200), for example, eventually wrote in turn of Hippocrates: `I shall interpret those observations [of his] which are too obscure, and add others of my own, arrived at by the methods he wrote down.'16 This of course became the very point of reading: to understand, learn from, then build upon a written text. By the fourth century BC, then, reading and writing were beginning to be seen in an entirely new light in the West. The Athenian dramatist Menander (c. 342­c. 292 BC) even maintained: `Those who can read see twice as well'.17 By this time the written word was often perceived to be not only on a par with, but superior to, the spoken word. By the beginning of the fourth century BC, `a certain number of men in Greek cities spent a lot of time with written texts, and many lives were affected by operations carried out in writing'.18 Writing flourished in Hellas chiefly because of papyrus, once the Ptolemies, the Macedonian dynasty that ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great (323 BC) to the death of Cleopatra (30 BC), had taken over Egypt and encouraged trade with the Greek city-states. Until papyrus, great works of literature often survived in a single skin exemplar. Aristotle's works, for example, were stored as scrolls in a cave and would doubtless have been lost forever had they not been purchased by an astute bibliophile who rescued them for posterity. Only after the fourth century BC, once large-scale importation of papyrus was enabled by the Ptolemies in Alexandria, did literature prosper in Greece, allowing many copies of a work, private collections, public libraries ­ indeed, a culture of the written word. The incipient book trade, which had begun in Athens in the fifth century BC, boomed in the third century BC once papyrus became commonly available. In other words, Alexander the Great's take-over of Egypt and imposition of a Macedonian
54 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Greek administration not only opened up the North African markets to European trade but, because of papyrus, gave rise to the power of the written word and the birth of written culture in the West, with all concomitant repercussions.19 By the end of the fourth century BC, the oral transmission of social knowledge had decisively become a written transmission. What was more, writing no longer merely documented and preserved, but legitimized and validated knowledge. One now composed specifically in order to preserve this poem or that teaching in writing. It achieved greater distribution and ensured authority. Reading was no longer a simple memory aid, but an autonomous channel for information conveyance, interpretation and creation. Greeks did not use writing with the ease and efficiency of the Egyptians, Levantines, Persians and others until the late fourth century BC. Even then (as later with the Romans) oral statements were considered equal to writing in most procedural matters. Whereupon Hellenistic Greeks, especially those ruling in Egypt, elaborated bureaucratic uses of reading and writing that far exceeded what had obtained in earlier centuries.20 The written word held entire states together. Even more importantly, elementary education now empowered society, as at least a few city-states benefited from individual philanthropists financing the attendance of all free boys (and, in some places, free girls) at public schools focusing on reading and writing Greek. Compulsory education for both boys and girls had figured as part of Plato's ideal republic.21 However, the philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372­c. 287 BC) countered that females were to learn only household responsibilities, as higher learning `turns a woman into a quarrelling, lazy gossip'. Although Greek courtesans and many female slaves might well have been literate,22 the typical female patrician, who would have had her female slaves read aloud to her, was not. The archetypal Hellenistic school always instructed far more boys than girls. Pupils began at seven years of age and graduated at fourteen.23 The teaching of reading followed an analytical method, which brought slow progress. First the Greek alphabet was taught, from alpha to omega. Then backwards. Then simultaneously, from both ends: alpha-omega, beta-psi, ending at mu-nu.
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 55

Whereupon more complex syllables were drilled. Then one learnt whole words, of one, then two, then three syllables. Vocabulary followed, including rare words (such as technical and medical terms) selected for their difficulty of reading and pronunciation. After several years, pupils were reading connected texts (first learnt by heart), which were special anthologies of famous passages selected also for their moral content: commonly Homer, Euripides and a few others. As important as reading was recitation, because reading always meant reading aloud. Formal rhetoric comprised an advanced study that built upon reading's foundation. Ancient Greek pedagogy was regimental, harsh and stifling. True inspiration would have lain elsewhere: in a kind tutor's lent scroll, a friend's special papyrus, a respected elder's moving oration. Private tutors instructed the scions of the powerful and wealthy. Through Aristotle's tutelage, for example, Alexander the Great became `a great lover of all kinds of learning and reading', according to his biographer, the Greek philosopher Plutarch (c. AD 46­c. 120).24 Wherever he journeyed, Alexander carried with him the scrolls of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and when he died at Babylon in 323 BC he was clutching one of his scrolls of the Iliad (similar to later generations expiring with a copy of the Bible or Qur'a ¯ n in hand). Such anecdotes of the rich and powerful testify to the growing reverence for the written word, which had become something personal and profound. The works of Homer, above all, became `a training ground where one generation of Greeks formed the character of the next until the end of antiquity'.25 (In similar fashion, Virgil's Æneid would, in time, become the same for the Romans.) It is difficult for us today to appreciate the depth of reverence in which Homer's writings, in particular, were held in antiquity. The earliest known public readings took place among the Greeks. Already in the fifth century BC, Herodotus (c. 485­c. 425 BC), the `Father of History', rather than travel from city to city to read his works, as was then customary, presented them to all assembled Greek men at the Olympic festivals. One must appreciate that the first public readings, both in Greece and Rome, still maintained that intimate connection between oral and written literature, in that the authors were presenting their own
56 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

works in a small society where they were also known personally. Each reader-reciter stamped a given interpretation ­ through intonation, tempo, emotion, gesture and other things ­ with a seal of authority as well, robbing the written text at the same time of its wealth of potential meanings. Entertainment, the sight and sound of a text, always dominated public readings. The text's substance was not immediate, the audience generally uncritical of everything but the performer himself: voice, passion, appearance, charisma. It was the world of oratory, of oral performance, with wholly other criteria obtaining than that of `reading' as we know it. It was the author-reader who incarnated the text, who thought for his passive audience. Physicians in antiquity even prescribed reading to their patients as a psychic exercise. This involved, of course, almost exclusively `being read to'. Many Greeks (and later Romans) kept a specially trained slave or freedwoman/freedman whose sole responsibility was to read to them aloud. These would have been particularly schooled in the correct scansion, pronunciation and delivery of both poetry and prose (two separate domains), as these features mattered as much as content. By the third century BC writing assisted every conceivable task in the highly bureaucratic, and thus well-organized and well-regulated, Greek-dominated society of Alexandria: vending beer, keeping a bath-house, accepting a paint job, trading in roasted lentils.26 Within just 33 days, for example, the finance minister Apollonius received 434 rolls of written papyrus to process. It should come as no surprise, then, that precisely where the papyrus trade first empowered the written word the ancient world's greatest shrine to writing rose: the Library of Alexandria.27 It was to become so famous that 150 years after its destruction Athenæus of Naucratis could still write, anticipating his readers' general knowledge: `And concerning the numbers of books, the establishing of libraries, and the collection in the Hall of the Muses, why need I even speak, since they are in all men's memories?'28 The Library of Alexandria was begun under Alexander's successor, the Macedonian Greek ruler Ptolemy I Soter (ruled 323­285 BC), probably as an attachment to the municipal
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 57

museum. At first the papyrus scrolls were simply stored in bookshelves placed in recesses stretching the length of a broad, roofed passageway. Each recess possibly categorized a given class of author, indicated by a clearly marked heading. In turn, each bookshelf would have been categorized into subheadings. The purpose of the Library, the result of Greek culture assimilating Egyptian antiquity, was to encompass the totality of human learning: it would represent the known world's memory. Even Aristotle's own book collection, in time, made it safely to Alexandria. It is alleged that by the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes (ruled 246-221 BC) no one person could read the complete holdings of the Library. Over a century and a half, the Library's collection expanded to include some 500,000 papyrus scrolls; a further 40,000 were housed in a separate depot attached to the nearby Temple of Serapis. It held the largest physical volume of literature the region had yet seen. How did the Library of Alexandria grow so vast? It enjoyed royal patronage, as an institutionalized national asset. Every ship that put in at Alexandria, one of the world's major ports, had to hand over for copying any scrolls it was carrying. Greek Egypt's ambassadors borrowed scrolls from other Greek libraries for copying. Whole libraries were purchased, others bequeathed. Many Greeks gave scrolls to the Library, while others lent theirs to be copied. Some fraudsters even sold Library officials apocryphal treatises by `Aristotle' (only centuries later proved to be forgeries). One drawback to such a vast collection was that no one could find anything, save through extraordinary memory, for as yet there was no efficient system of book cataloguing. The North African-born Callimachus of Cyrene (c. 305­c. 240 BC), teacher, writer, poet and epigrammatist, finally devised one of the world's earliest known, rational, cataloguing systems here at the Library of Alexandria, where he eventually came to work. An advocate of clear, concise writing, Callimachus, labouring under the Chief Librarian Apollonius of Rhodes (his opposite and adversary), undertook his task using a novel conception: the library as a model of the entire world, as perceived by the Greek scholars of the era.
58 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Once done, the Library's catalogue alone numbered 120 scrolls (Callimachus did not live to see the completion of his task). The collection was divided into eight sections, according to subject matter: drama, oratory, lyric poetry, legislation, medicine, history, philosophy and `miscellaneous' (significant is the lack of a separate category for theology, the Middle Ages' most important). Long texts were copied in several shorter `books', allowing the reader the ease of individual, smaller papyrus scrolls. Innovatively, books were listed in Greek alphabetical order (alpha, beta, gamma, delta and so forth); although known earlier, alphabetical listing had never been used to catalogue books on such a vast scale. Now, for the first time anywhere, a library was more than a depot of papyrus scrolls: it became a systematized information centre, since access had been acknowledged to be as important as the data themselves ­ indeed, the two in tandem were recognized to be of greatest benefit. In this way the Library of Alexandria became the Mediterranean's premier centre of learning based on the written word. All subsequent libraries were to follow the Alexandrian model. (We still follow the Library of Alexandria today, albeit in an evolved fashion.) At this time an entirely new literary genre appeared that, over the millennia, would conquer the world: the novel. One of the earliest novels to survive in its entirety, probably from the second century AD, begins: `My name is Chariton of Aphrodisias and I am clerk to the lawyer Athenagoras. I'm going to tell you a love story that took place in Syracuse ...'. It was the first great age of love stories, the type of tale that only much later would come to be known as the romance (a word derived from the Old French romanz, meaning `a work composed in the vernacular tongue'). Like so many popular works of today, the ancient Greek novel flaunted adventure and love. A pair of (typically) well-born lovers, suffering separation and misfortune but always trusting in the gods and themselves and preserving their mutual pledges of love, at last find their way back together and live happily ever after.29 Longus's Daphnis and Chloe, for example, probably from the first half of the third century AD, thrilled centuries of readers with its bucolic tale of two young lovers who struggle to realize their true love for one
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 59

another. (Roman patricians loved novels, too, especially in Greek.) The early Greek novels ­ never a greatly popular literary genre, to judge by the few surviving fragments ­ comprised apparently only light reading, primarily for entertainment, with a sophistication of language bespeaking an educated female readership. (Men, on the other hand, appear to have preferred the epic and drama: that is, warfare and heroes.) Such novels lost popularity between the sixth and eighth centuries AD, but Byzantine scholars revived them in the ninth to eleventh centuries ­ greatly influencing, in turn, Arabic, Spanish and then pan-European audiences. Contrary to what some historians have alleged, reading did not give the Greeks democracy, theoretical science or formal logic. That is, reading per se did not change the way people thought. It did, however, encourage more people to write about what they thought. And it provided an opportunity for these and similar predispositions to take root and flourish.30

the jews
Following the lead of the Greeks, the Jews of the Middle East had been among the first to appreciate the manifest benefits of cultural reading, perhaps as early as the seventh century BC. Unlike the Greeks, however, they came to enshrine the very act as something sacred. Babylonians and Assyrians had greatly respected magical texts. But this had been because of these texts' useful instructions for understanding the supernatural and exploiting its forces for personal health, wealth or power. The respect had never entailed veneration of the written word itself, that is, the sanctification of writing and its physical material. The Levantine Jews introduced just such a sanctification, thereby adding a whole new dimension to reading. 31 The written word in fact became fundamental to the Jewish identity. After dedication to God, learning (the reading and interpreting of `sacred' texts) is the Jew's next duty to his faith. (Jewish women were discouraged from, indeed frequently forbidden, reading and writing until only recently.) Reading and
60 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

disputing are held to be the way towards understanding of the divine. The chanted office, one common throughout the ancient Middle East, became a liturgy based entirely on written texts. The very act of reading such texts became part of the holy observance, the direct transmission of the divine covenant. This new concept, born in Hebrew liturgy, eventually inspired Christian Greeks and Romans, whose liturgy spread the practice, as well as the new dimension of the written word, thoughout the Western world. Christianity was founded on, and quickly diffused through, the Judaic exaltation of the written word. By then, reading had transcended even ecclesiastical authority. It had become the Word of God. Best accommodating Hebrew and Aramaic writing's specific Levantine ramification would be the recently proposed dating of the composition of the Biblical account of Israel's `origin and history' to the reign of King Josiah, who ruled from 639 to 609 BC.32 Josiah's court reinstituted the exclusive worship of the god of the Israelites, centred on the Temple of Jerusalem. Josiah's greater goal, however, was to expand his reign over all Judah and the former northern kingdom. Achieving this necessitated the literary creation of a coherent narrative of Israelite history as a clear instrument of God's will. If this explanation is correct, it would mean that the Pentateuch or Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and all the historical books of the Hebrew Bible are, in fact, political fiction, composed at a much later date than the events they appear to document. Such stories were meant to furnish Josiah's present and future subjects with a mythical past in order to create a national consciousness of `Jewdom', with its own unique theology. A fully developed national consciousness finally emerged only during the Babylonian Exile (597/586­538 BC) when Aramaic writing was also borrowed to convey the Hebrew language in hitherto unprecedented ways, or even later, during the Hellenistic period (332­63 BC) after the kingdom of Judah had become Judæa. The idea of writing being the `Word of God' had to be a late phenomenon, since Phoenician and Greek bookkeeping and administrative records would have been virtually all that early
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 61

Hebrew scribes had comprehended from the primitive practice. It seems likely that, at least for most of their early history as an incipient `nation', the Jews did not resort to writing at all. Only around the ninth century BC did the first Old Hebrew monumental inscriptions begin to appear, written in Phoenician letters. Whereupon the Jews began using writing with increasing frequency, but for bookkeeping, administration, taxes and the rare monumental and funerary inscription: all the functions of writing known to their contemporaries. But law was never scripture, for Hebrew law was customary law, and this was validated only orally by town elders. In Hebrew, too, as in all languages of antiquity, `to read' (qara' ) was polyvalent, with the additional meanings `to call, call out, recite, proclaim', again emphasizing reading's fundamental sense: `speaking aloud from a written text'. There was no single word like the English `read' that captured the act's uniqueness because, again, this uniqueness would not obtain for many centuries. From scribal accounts to `God-written tablets' embraced not a leap, but a veritable transcendence of human imagination. Yahweh's commandments to the Hebrews to construct the Ark of the Covenant in order to enshrine the miraculously inscribed Tables of the Law occur in Deuteronomy, which was apparently composed in the late seventh century BC when the Jews were creating their identity while collating an entire library of oral traditions that comprised many, often conflicting, genres from several epochs. It is this inspired confusion that informs the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, revealing many revisions and editions. Most ancient of all are the oral poems. The `Song of Songs', for example, reproduces the typical secular love or erotic song-poem of the late second millennium BC. Of similar antiquity are some historical events, which perhaps had first been written down in the Phoenician (and later in the Old Hebrew) script, in order to record the rise of the early Hebrew monarchy. Many written versions of Hebrew traditions competed with one another: there is evidence of robust literary skirmishes having taken place in antiquity. No writing was yet truly `sacred'. When all temporal power collapsed in the sixth century BC,
62 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

religious power filled the social vacuum, copying the mores, customs, even the script of the dominant Aramaic-speaking Babylonians. It was then, in the Babylonian Exile, that the rites of Jerusalem's cult were written down and the authoritative revisions of the priestly code were undertaken. This continued after the Exile as well until, by the fifth century BC, the Pentateuch or Torah stood in a fairly `authoritative' edition. Immediately predating the Exile, King Josiah appears, then, to have been the initial source of writing's first veneration among the Jews, introducing a new use of traditional writing foremost to acquire greater political control. He enacted legislation attempting to proclaim the Temple of Jerusalem the sole sanctuary of Yahweh. During this same process one of Josiah's secretaries suddenly `discovered' (c. 622 BC) the scrolls of the Book of Deuteronomy inside the Temple, these hitherto unknown scrolls being just that part of the Torah in which the laws defining the Jewish people and their duties and responsibilities are laid down. Here, too, Moses is claimed to have said (IV:2): `Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you'. Josiah gathered his subjects together to read this `newly discovered' work aloud, whereupon he convinced them to contract a new covenant with God. This was the beginning of a protracted process that involved sanctifying writing itself, something that had never happened before and only was possible now because of writing's recent commercialization, a more literate public and a new appreciation in the Levant and Ægean of the expanded cultural possibilities of the written word. This very late date of Hebrew consolidation, as recently suggested by `minimalist' scholars, certainly also accommodates most economically the known history of the emergence of a rudimentarily `literate' society in the region. Of course traditional Hebrew history, based on the Torah, would place the veneration of writing in the late second millennium BC, when Moses is alleged to have received on Mount Sinai the Ten Commandments, the miraculously inscribed Tables of the Law (Exodus XIX­XX). This is implausible, however, as the Jews probably did not possess writing this early. It is more reasonable
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 63

to expect such veneration to emerge at the same time that a semi-literate Mediterranean society was appearing. This occurred only around the middle of the first millennium BC. With writing's sanctification, the book also became metaphor. For it was in this momentum of creating a new Jewish history and identity through veneration of the written word that, in 593 BC, just three years after Nebuchadnezzar's first attack on Jerusalem, Ezekiel the Prophet beheld Yahweh mounted on his chariot, instructing him (Ezekiel II:8­10): `"Open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee"./ And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; / And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without; and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.' From a priestly clan, Ezekiel was well familiar with Phoenician and Aramaic literature. Through prophecies often reading like articles of Judaic law, he ultimately described his vision of the Temple of Jerusalem restored and the newly proposed `traditional' faith of monotheism triumphant. In fact, Jerusalem was destroyed seven years later, in 586 BC, whereupon all Jews were exiled to Babylon. After the Exile, having been influenced by cosmopolitan Babylon, the Jews had a new understanding of, and respect for, the written Aramaic word. Scribes suddenly took on a new significance in Jewish society as they redacted older Hebrew traditions and writings in the Aramaic that all Jews now spoke and was becoming the lingua franca of the powerful Persian Empire (550­330 BC). In the synagogues, the scribes began reading and commenting on what was only then becoming the Torah (still only the Pentateuch, the Bible's first five books), later to become the whole body of traditional Jewish teaching. The scribes became the key interpreters of the Law, the editors of the scriptures, commentaries and translations, the very spokesmen of Yahweh. They were also Judaism's prime readers. It was also after their return to Judah from the Babylonian Exile that the Jews constituted the sacred word. It was very much a Hellenistic-influenced process in a region now becoming Judæa, when Greek language, culture and customs came to resonate throughout all aspects of the new faith. The
64 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

traditional names of the `oldest' books of the Torah ­ Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy ­ are mainly of Greek and Latin origin, witnessing their late date of composition or collation. Almost all Jews, however, remained illiterate in antiquity, at least in Hebrew and Aramaic. (For commercial reasons many, however, read and wrote Greek.) For their sacred texts most relied on temple scribes or on their own prodigious memories. Only under the Roman Emperor Vespasian (AD 69­79) was the canon of the Bible, the list of sacred writings recognized as `genuine', finally a closed subject. Shortly afterwards, once Roman Judæa had become Roman Palestine, the Mishnah or approved commentary on the Torah was set down in writing. At that time reading in the main focused on these first five books of the Hebrew Bible. The oral and written commentaries known as the Talmud were written in later varieties of Hebrew (and in Aramaic). In the fourth and fifth centuries AD the Eastern and Western Talmud (the primary source of Jewish religious law, including the Mishnah and the Gemara) were put into authoritative written form, in tandem with the written codification of law that was taking place at the same time throughout the Roman Empire. Talmudists appreciated that the Hebrew Bible encoded a multiplicity of significances, the continuous study of which was the chief purpose of their life. The Midrash, that collation of scholarly essays addressing the holy texts' deeper meaning, alleged that the Torah handed to Moses by God on Mount Sinai was both written and oral at the same time; Moses had studied this during his 40 days alone there, reading the text by day and considering its commentary by night. The ethnic myth rendered the Torah not merely a monolithic perfection (as later mediæval Christians believed of their Biblia Sacra, and Muslims of their Qur'a ¯ n), but also an open-ended revelation: something always to be learnt from as society changed. In other words, a text could be both at once: the original (authoritative) and its interpretation (creative), with the latter endlessly supplementing and perpetuating the former. The concept also became Western Europe's, but this was not until the Renaissance.
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 65

Jewish veneration for the written word was taken to extremes in subsequent centuries. The sixth-century AD Sefer Yezirah ­ Hebrew's earliest extant text of systematic, speculative thought ­ declared, for example, that God had created the world with 32 secret `paths of wisdom' consisting of ten numbers and 22 letters.33 The physical world, time and the human body that comprised the cosmos's three strata were their direct product. All creation could be regarded as a veritable book of numbers and letters. Were we mortals to read the numbers and letters `properly', unlocking their combination in imitation of God, we could similarly give life. Indeed, after studying the Sefer Yezirah the Talmudic scholars Hanani and Hoshaiah were able to create, as one mediæval Jewish legend relates, their weekly dinner of a three-year-old calf!34

romans
Italy's Etruscans, inspired to write their own unique language for the first time using the alphabetic writing of their new neighbours, the colonial Greeks, never developed even a rudimentarily literate society. Instead, they kept their writing restricted mainly to funerary inscriptions, legal contracts, labelling of goods and possibly some administrative and bookkeeping tasks. In the first millennium BC this exceedingly restricted use of writing seems to have characterized all subsequent Etruscan-derived scripts on the Italian peninsula, such as that of the Ligurians, Lepontines, Rhætians, Gallicians, Venetians, Oscans and others. Only one offshoot of the Etruscan script succeeded to greater literacy ­ and eventually to immortality: Latin, as written and spoken by the inhabitants of Rome. The earliest readings in Latin consisted of owners' names on vases and metal objects, some religious dedications and a few short texts. One can assume that Rome's first kings and merchants made frequent use of waxed tablets for correspondence and accounts. Only during the fourth century BC, however, do more substantial inscriptions appear. By then, writing had also become `vital to the effectiveness of Rome's military and
66 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

political power'.35 Writing's functions broadened throughout the era of the Republic. In the late Republic, the use of writing increased exponentially, both in function and in geography, with the Romanization of the provinces that took place in the second and first centuries BC. Some recent historians have claimed that ancient Romans enjoyed `modern' literacy. But this is surely an exaggeration. Certainly, the range of writing in the Roman Empire was very great:
The Romans used written receipts and kept written accounts, wrote up political slogans, organized their armed forces by means of a mass of documentation, kept records of who became a citizen, circulated the texts of magical spells and books advocating religious beliefs, abused each other and protested love to each other in graffiti, wrote letters, and, in great numbers, commemorated the dead.36

Yet Roman society remained fundamentally oral, still perceiving reading to be an adjunct skill, not a primary faculty. Latin likewise possessed no single word that distinguished a unique act. Lego ¯ (`I read') equally embraced `I gather, collect; choose, select; peruse, scan; read out, read aloud, recite'. One could also say e ¯ volvo ¯ (`I read'), which further included the meanings `I unroll, unfold; peruse, study', deriving from the act of unrolling a papyrus scroll. Before 100 BC probably fewer than one out of ten inhabitants of the city of Rome itself could read and write, and throughout the entire Empire fewer than one out of 20 or 30 women. This was not a literate society. The Roman volumen or scroll, like its Greek counterpart, measured about 25 cm in width by six to ten metres in length, and was thus capable of holding relatively long texts. (In general, a volumen held about as much text as one of today's slim paperbacks.) This was the advantage of papyrus, which allowed lengthier works to be put into writing in the first place; until then, skin, wood, wax, pottery, ivory, metal, stone and bark usually permitted only brief inscriptions. Unlike the Greek scroll, however, which commonly descended the length in continuous lines (like today's PC screen), the Roman volumen was inscribed
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 67

perpendicular to the length, so that individual `pages' of writing appeared as one unscrolled. While reading, then, Greeks customarily held their scrolls with one hand over the other, Romans with both hands opposite each other. Each `page' of a volumen (each scrolled-open segment) had two parallel columns of 15 to 30 letters each in 25 to 45 lines, totalling between 750 and 2,700 letters per page.37 (Today's double-spaced typewritten page holds around 1,700 letters.) Typically, lines held a specific number of letters. The earliest papyrus volumina were written in clear, easily legible and even elegant letters for the most part, the size of which matched the scribe's fee. Each line of poetry contained an epic hexameter, iambic trimeter or dramatic declamatory verse, while any given line of prose had up to 30 letters. Such short lines helped the eye to identify the individual words, facilitating comprehension. Until the second or third century AD Latin writers separated words using two or three dots; whereupon scriptura continua (run-together text) became traditional. Though known, punctuation was never granted much importance. Pauses, used principally for oratory, were often merely a blank space in the middle of a line. As mentioned earlier, Greek grammarians had introduced diacritical marks ­ signs placed above or below a letter ­ early on, first to aid pronunciation and accenting (like actors' or newsreaders' cues of today), but then to distinguish whole words, sentences and paragraphs. The basis of all ancient punctuation was rhetoric, not logical analysis. (Today, punctuation is linked mainly to meaning, not to sound, the consequence of oral reading having become silent reading.) Reading a scroll was not a simple matter, for one had to unscroll continuously. Jumping backwards or forwards, or searching for a specific passage, was laborious. There was no table of contents, no index. To close the scroll in order to store it properly, one had to rescroll all the way back to the start. (To leave it open to one segment would invite damage.) And it was an extremely expensive, thus precious object, always demanding safe storage away from children, dogs, rodents, thieves and, above all, rain or spilt wine. If fire broke out in a house, volumina were of course the very first things one grabbed after the children.
68 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Throughout the Empire, from Caledonia (Scotland) to Cappadocia (eastern Turkey), one read almost the same `hand', proof of an enormous volume of personal correspondence maintaining Empire-wide standards. An immediately recognizable Roman cursive became the common letter-shape. Within a short period only one or two strokes were used to form each letter in rapid succession, indicating very frequent writing. If writing had first served as an instrument of power wielded by a small oligarchy, it became in time, through continuing Roman conquests, commonplace in the administration and daily correspondence of an increasingly vast Empire. Though Cicero (106­43 BC) himself, the Great Orator, deemed that, for human memory, seeing a text was much better than merely hearing it,38 thus acknowledging reading's unique advantage in Rome's oral society, most Romans believed that human speech reigned supreme. Oral statements were equal, if not superior, to writing in most procedural matters. Indeed, the Romans in particular, far more than the Greeks, awarded speech a paramount importance in civic affairs, resembling in this more the northern Germans than their trading partners and subjects in the Levant, above all the Jews.39 Although their most visible reading today might be monumental Latin inscriptions, this self-aggrandizement of temporal authority comprised only a minute fraction of the ancient Romans' reading matter. At least where literature and learning were concerned, Roman reading meant Greek reading and Roman learning meant Greek learning.40 Only in later centuries did Latin authors, above all Virgil, achieve classic veneration. For all Roman pupils, however, learning to read and write almost entirely comprised learning to read and write Greek. Education itself meant Greek education. But unlike Greece, where only a privileged minority took part in a civic life that required a fairly high degree of literacy, Rome, beginning in the late Republic (the second and first centuries BC), had a greater representation of its citizens actively participating in forms of communal life demanding reading: posted texts of proposed laws and names of candidates for office, registers of declarations to the censor, voting-tablets obliging electors to write in a name, and other civic manifestations.
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 69

Rome was run by clerks and upheld by at least a partially literate citizenry. Indeed, it was perhaps the first `Empire of Reading', in that most patricians as well as a large number of freedmen, freedwomen and slaves ­ in Rome, the rest of Romanized Italy and many of the provinces ­ read and wrote on a daily basis. Unlike everywhere else in the world until then, including Greece, writing appeared nearly everywhere in the Empire: on coins, monuments, gravestones, altars at crossroads, boundary stones, aqueduct markers, milestones, not to mention the ubiquitous shop signs, posters, placards (carried on poles during processions) and graffiti. In Pompeii, for example, electoral posters shouted from public walls. (In the subsequent Middle Ages, conversely, such public writing was nearly non-existent.) Most families were their own bookkeepers. And Roman troops `had almost as much red tape as modern armies'.41 This is the lesson to be learnt from Vindolanda, a former Roman military base in northern England along Hadrian's Wall.42 Since 1973 some two thousand letters and documents on wooden tablets have been unearthed there, attesting to writing's pervasiveness in ancient Roman society. Comprising the largest archive of early Roman writings discovered anywhere, the Vindolanda literature dates from between AD 85 and 130. All inscriptions are written in ink or engraved by stylus on wax and convey the thoughts of ordinary men and women corresponding with each other on the base itself and with others far removed. The fact that such a trove, in such an isolated locale, exists at all testifies to the great amount of correspondence that must have been taking place among Romans throughout the Empire. At this time, writing maintained personal contact, ultimately preserving the social network and Roman culture even in primitive foreign parts.43 Such correspondence also secured military supplies and sanctioned orders, as well as conveying essential intelligence. In other words, reading and writing kept the Empire functioning. More recently other Roman sites in Britain ­ Carlisle, Ribchester and Caerleon in Wales, to name only three ­ have revealed similar caches of wooden tablets. It appears that, by the first few centuries AD, most literate Romans read aloud to themselves and wrote their own correspondence, as both the faculty and skill expanded beyond the patrician class
70 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

and milieu. Especially trained slaves and professional scribes and secretaries no longer dominated the ranks of readers. The large demand for papyrus scrolls, and later for parchment volumes, made books merchandise. Greatest in demand were Homer and Virgil, of course. As of the fourth century AD the Bible came to the fore, if at first in only fragmented, `unfinished' form. (A general rule for reading had been laid down in the second century AD whereby the most recent edition of a text was acknowledged to replace the edition before it. Only the most recent edition of a work, in other words, now contained the `authorized' version.)44 Still, even at the height of Rome's passion for written literature, books (scrolls) remained scarce. The imported Egyptian papyrus predominately bore accounts and records, authenticated documents and final drafts of official acts. Only the very wealthy could possess, much less amass, entire papyrus books. Most of Pompeii's and Herculaneum's wealthiest residences, for example, have revealed only a small handful of scrolls. This was because papyrus remained too dear. The marketed books of the Late Republic and High Empire were often shockingly shabby. In truth, only Senators and their wealthy relations could afford proper collectors' quality, and at outrageous prices. The New Testament (Acts XIX:19) chronicles that, at a time when one denarius was the normal day-wage, Ephesus's magic books were worth fifty thousand denarii. In a land where one drachma was worth one denarius, the Greek writer Lucian (c. AD 120­ after 180) mentions one rare book as costing 30,750 drachmas!45 Rome was of course the centre of book publishing, marketing and distributing for the Empire. Cicero's correspondent Atticus, for example, was also Cicero's bookseller; Atticus owned a complement of slaves who principally copied books in Greek for sale. (Occasionally Latin books were also copied.) A corrector, an early incarnation of today's copy editor, would be called upon to revise texts. `Press runs' could be quite large. In the first century AD the exceedingly wealthy, powerful and vain Marcus Regulus Aquilius, on the death of his young son, not only commissioned images of the deceased to be fashioned in paint, wax, silver, gold, ivory and marble, but he publicly read aloud before a large audience a biography of the boy, then had
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 71

scribes complete one thousand copies of this biography to be distributed throughout Italy and the provinces. Whereupon Regulus wrote to local officials to have them select a gifted orator among them to read the work aloud to assembled townspeople ­ which they did.46 Like today, bookshops were `popular' places in Rome, with wooden racks holding the latest editions of papyrus scrolls. Men of letters socialized with booksellers in the evenings and often visited their premises during the day. The booksellers had posters put up announcing new works; flyers were circulated to prominent addresses; sometimes extracts from the works were freely distributed to elicit interest. As provincial Roman settlements became cities in their own right, booksellers set up shop there, too, far from Rome.47 The poet and satirist Horace (65­8 BC), a contemporary of Emperor Augustus, boasted that his Ars poetica was now selling along the Bosphorus, in Spain, Gaul and Africa: truly an `international bestseller'. His contemporary Propertius (c. 50­c. 15 BC), the elegiac poet, was delighted to hear he was being read in northern climes. The Spanish-born epigrammatist and poet Martial (c. AD 40­c. 104) was proud to learn that among his readers were the young people and elderly ladies of Vienne in western central Gaul. His friend Pliny the Younger wrote to their mutual friend Geminus, `That there are booksellers in Lugdunum [Lyon, France] I had no idea, and so learn all the more agreeably from your letter that my books are finding buyers there; I'm pleased their popularity is maintained abroad that they've won in the City [Rome]' (Letters IX:11). Roman schools imitated Greek schools in nearly every way: they were just as regimental, harsh and stifling. Prefiguring what many educators endorse today, the Spanish lawyer and educator Quintilian (c. AD 30­c. 96), who tutored Emperor Domitian's grand-nephews and authored the celebrated Institutio oratoria, encouraged reading to begin as early as possible in a child's life, counselling:
Some hold that boys should not be taught to read till they are seven years old, that being the earliest age at which they can derive profit from instruction and endure the strain of learning. Those however who hold that a child's mind should not
72 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

be allowed to lie fallow for a moment are wiser. Chrysippus [d c. 205 BC], for instance, though he gives the nurses a three years' reign, still holds the formation of the child's mind on the best principles to be a part of their duties. Why, again, since [small] children are capable to moral training, should they not be capable of literary education? 48

Reading circles similar to those in ancient Greece appeared in Rome at the beginning of the second century BC. The earliest known was grouped around the famous general Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (c. 235­183 BC), who had commanded the Roman invasion of Carthage in the Second Punic War and defeated Hannibal at Zama in North Africa in 202 BC. This circle also welcomed and fostered authors who were not of the patrician class, promoted Greek language and culture, practised frequent and florid correspondence with fellow members and, when they met, sometimes exchanged nugæ or brief poems. Literary groups like these were usually the province of dominant women. At the time of Emperor Augustus in the late first century BC the foremost of these were Precia and Lesbia, who entertained, promoted and fostered up-and-coming authors, `managing' their careers in high society and steering them towards fame and fortune. Again as in Greece, public readings were fashionable throughout the Roman Empire. Augustus himself went to such readings `with both goodwill and patience'.49 Authors presented their latest verses, histories, stories, and their literary friends, fellow scholars or poets, as well as family, clan supporters and the general public would attend to loudly call out approval, clap at regular intervals, and jump up and cheer at particularly stirring passages. Such an audience reaction was not just a kind gesture towards a family member or colleague; it was actually part of the traditional etiquette, and expected. (Indeed, the lack of a demonstrative response by any party could be the cause of grievous umbrage.) All good writers anticipated constructive criticism at a public reading. Hearing this, they would then refine their work to accommodate the public taste. The audience was expected to arrive on time and remain for the entirety of the reading. The decorum was often abused, however, which
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 73

incurred the wrath of such traditionalists as Pliny the Younger. Readings were partly so popular because many of the wealthier patricians, who built auditoriums in their residences specifically for the purpose, believed themselves to be poets and writers of rare talent, worthy of larger audiences than mere banqueters. Nearly all of them performed only their own works while denying others the customary chair on the dais. More important than a work's substance was often the author's skill in oratory, since, like today, entertainment habitually outweighed inspiration. Pliny the Younger, our prime source for such information in the first century AD, praised young Calpurnius Piso, for example, for his superb reading of his Greek `Transpositions among the Constellations':
... a scholarly, illuminating essay. It was written in flowing, tender, smooth, even sublime distichs ... Appropriately and with variation he raised and lowered his tone, alternated lofty with simple, dry with sonorous, sober with jocular, all with equal talent. These were commended by his very pleasing voice, and his voice by his modest personality. His flushed visage clearly showed his excitement, adding special charm to the recitor. Somehow reserve suits literary men better than self-assurance ... After the recitation was over I kissed the young man long and heartily and ­ the sharpest spur of every admonition ­ encouraged him with heartfelt appreciation to carry on as he has begun.50

There were known devices one could employ if uncertain when reading prose but secure in poetry, or uncertain in poetry but secure in prose (both demanding different techniques). As Pliny wrote to the Roman biographer and historian Suetonius when he was planning an informal reading before a few invited friends:
Get me out of this mess! It seems I'm a poor reciter, at least of verses; orations are all right, but so much worse the verses. So I'm thinking of trying out one of my freedmen at the coming recitation among intimate friends. That also suits the intimate circle in that I've selected one who'll be not good but at
74 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

least better than me at reciting as long as he's not self-conscious. He is namely, as reader, just as novice as I as poet. But now I don't know how I should behave while he's reading, whether I should sit there dull and dumb as if the whole business weren't mine, or, as many do, accompany his recitation with whispers, looks and gestures. But I think I'm as ill-suited a pantomimist as I am a reader. I repeat once again: get me out of this mess! And write me forthwith whether it's better to recite poorly than perform these tricks or not. Vale.51

Pliny the Younger also recalled (Letters I:13) how Emperor Claudius had once been walking on the Palatine Hill, heard some noise and asked about its cause; told that Nonianus was giving a public reading, Claudius suddenly and unexpectedly came to listen. But in Pliny's days it seemed only those with too much leisure time on their hands came to readings any longer, and only after several invitations and reminders, while the majority never showed up at all. `I for my part,' he wrote to a friend, `have hardly ever let anyone down. However, these were mostly friends of mine'. The choice of what text to read in public was extremely sensitive, determined by rank, station, influence, political situation, sense of public decency and many other factors. Reading aloud was always a very demonstrative act. The material had to be socially acceptable. The spoken word was still inextricably linked to the literary text. There did not yet exist the independent domain of `silent literature' or `non-oral literature'. This limitation clearly comes across in Martial's mordant epigram:
The verse is mine; but friend, when you declaim it, It seems like yours, so grievously you maim it.52

The distinction also obtained in the celebrated phrase scripta manet, verba volat, which originally meant `writing reposes, speaking soars'. (Only in later centuries did it assume the significance `writing remains, speaking flees', a conceptual reinterpretation.) For in antiquity it was a reader's tacit duty to publicly exalt and demarcate the auctorial argument, not to sow a latently multifarious message. All written literature was
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 75

primarily, though not exclusively, for public sharing, to distinguish and thereby confine a writer's meaning. The `reader' was a transmitter, not a receiver. Public readings usually occupied only a few hours. Some lasted for as long as a week, however, their attendance assured by the fame or power of the author. Pliny the Younger attended one that lasted for three days, but probably only because the author, Sentius Augurinus, had begun by announcing:
I sing songs with short verses As once Catullus and my Calvus did And all those of old. But what is this to me? One Pliny alone is first for me ... How many Catos does it take for one Pliny! 53

Pliny listened `with the greatest pleasure, indeed with admiration ... I do believe that for a number of years nothing more consummate in this fashion has been written'. Such readings often became `examinations' for pretenders and sycophants vying for favour, higher office, a Senate seat or `mass' sales of their most recent poem or history. Readings proliferated in Rome, but not all authors were pleased by this development. Many resented that public readings became the only way to become known. And established writers protested that this profligacy of readings demeaned the custom's edifying function in society. Indeed, Pliny's contemporary Martial was so offended by would-be poets accosting him from all sides that he decried in one of his own poems:
I ask you, who can endure these efforts? You read to me when I'm standing, You read to me when I'm sitting, You read to me when I'm running, You read to me when I'm shitting! 54

How `popular' were writers with the public? Virgil, for one, was given a standing ovation one day when he entered the Roman amphitheatre. Among the graffiti found on the walls of Pompeii are lines recognized to be mutilated from Ovid. There
76 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

was a cultivated public of readers, to be sure, who knew books and read them frequently, despite their cost and rarity. Most reading, including public readings, took place in daylight hours, because of sight problems as prevalent as today's and because of poor illumination in houses, making evening reading difficult. Multiple candles, rush lights and oil lamps furnished enough light to read by, but most of these were far too dear for all but the most affluent households. If one could, one read in direct sunlight: usually in the open atrium or courtyard. Few, however, commanded such leisure at daytime. Poorsighted readers simply had their works of literature or account books read aloud to them by family, friends, employees or slaves. Like the ancient Egyptians and Greeks before them, some hyperopic Romans would surely have used polished stones to magnify the writing, while others simply used drinking glasses filled with water. It had been difficult for the Greeks to read on the kline ¯, the ancient bed. Though also used for leisurely reclining, the kline ¯ made it awkward to unroll a papyrus scroll upward with the right hand while the left arm was propping up the body; actually, no ancient illustrations or sculptures exist showing a person leaning up on a kline ¯ with both hands free, as we read in bed today. The Roman lectus, however, had many variants, one of which was specifically designed for reading and writing by the dim light of the lucubrum, the candle of wax-soaked cloth. In the Satyricon of Petronius (d ad 66), for example, Trimalchio composes on, then reads from, his pile of miniature cushions atop his multi-purpose lectus. Romans read whenever they could, it appears ­ often to the chagrin of their physician: Antyllus (second century AD) warned that people who never learnt verses by heart but resorted to reading them in books occasionally experience painful bowel movements because of excessive perspiration; people with a fine memory for spoken verses, he added, needed only eliminate these noxious fluids through normal breathing.55 The Roman statesman, philosopher and dramatist Seneca (c. 4 BC ­ AD 65), tutor and adviser to Emperor Nero, in whose attempted murder he was implicated, protested at having to study in his loud private lodgings. Martial relates how some went hunting carrying
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 77

along a scroll in a string bag. Horace visited his country house with literature in tow, as did the lyric poet Catullus (c. 84­c. 54 BC) when he frequented Verona. Roman booksellers even made special travelling scrolls since, just like today, many people enjoyed reading while on the move. The scrolls likely held works already committed to memory, however, their perusal allowing one to re-enact the public performance vicariously. Like Greece, the Roman Empire also had its libraries. The first Roman libraries mainly held Greek scrolls, as `proper' reading for any educated Roman was of course Greek, not Latin. Among the celebrated Greek libraries that the Romans had ransacked were the Royal Macedonian Library; the library of Apellicon of Teos (which Cicero later used in Rome); and the library of Mithridates, king of Pontus, who had been defeated by the Roman general Pompey and commited suicide in 63 BC. Many libraries filled private homes. Julius Cæsar's father-inlaw, for one, the powerful Lucius Calpurnius Piso, maintained an enormous library in his luxurious seaside villa at Herculaneum, on the Bay of Naples. Buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 and rediscovered in 1752, the mainly Greeklanguage library is the largest that has survived from antiquity, having thus far relinquished over 1,800 papyrus scrolls, including hundreds of hitherto lost works of Greek philosophy and a small collection of Roman poetry. Archæologists now suspect that a second library, on a lower level of Piso's multi-terraced villa, awaits imminent discovery. In the first century AD Seneca decried the fad of ostentatiously displaying one's domestic scroll collection: `Many people without a school education use books not as tools for study but as decorations for the dining room!'56 He further railed against the scroll collector `who gets his pleasure from bindings and labels'. In the households of these collectors, he fumed, `you can see the complete works of orators and historians on shelves up to the ceiling, because, like bathrooms, a library has become an essential ornament of a rich house'. The inflated Trimalchio in Petronius's Satyricon even boasts that he has `two libraries' ­ one Greek and one Latin! Already by the time of the historian Tacitus (c. AD 56­c. 120) many readers no longer sought the eloquence of a Livy or
78 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Cicero, in which public oratory thrived, but the terseness, brevity and matter-of-factness of the scholar accustomed more to the study than the dais. Still, the new style exploited the techniques of skilled oration, revising them for a targeted audience of like-minded scholars. This produced a division among Roman readers. There were those among the élite who particularly enjoyed and encouraged this new brevity of style. Then there was the large majority of readers who preferred conventional rhetoric and bought those popular genres that used and perpetuated it. Some country houses in the fifth century AD held Latin classics for the men and devotional works for the women. The gender distinction is significant. Women were lauded as bibliophiles only rarely. One of the most celebrated was Melania the Younger (c. AD 385­439), who lived in Rome and North Africa and died in Bethlehem. St Augustine (AD 354-430) dedicated one of his works to her grandmother, also named Melania (c. AD 342­c. 410), whom he also praised in one of his letters as a formidable scribe, hinting at her writing talent. The Roman scholar Gerontius, too, recalled with relish how Melania the Younger `would go through the Lives of the [Church] Fathers as if she were reading desert'. Indeed, he praised her passion for reading:
She read books that were bought, as well as books she chanced upon with such diligence that no word or thought remained unknown to her. So overwhelming was her love of learning, that when she read in Latin, it seemed to everyone that she did not know Greek and, on the other hand, when she read in Greek, it was thought that she did not know Latin.57

Among the most highly valued books of antiquity were the three Greek books of the Sibylline Prophecies. These lay stored in a chest in a stone vault underneath Rome's Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Oracular women who divined in riddles, the ten sibyls ­ from Cumæ, Cyme, Delphi, Erythrea, the Hellespont, Libya, Persia, Phrygia, Samos and Tibur ­ were `immortals' whose words, the Greeks and Romans believed, held profound significance for mortals. Originally, nine scrolls of prophecies
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 79

had existed. The Sibyl of Cumæ had offered these to the seventh and last legendary king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus (616­579 BC). Twice Tarquinius refused to purchase them, and so twice the Sibyl burnt three scrolls. In the end Tarquinius bought the last three for the price of all nine. These were then held in Rome for centuries as `sacred texts', as with the Jews' recently created `ancient' writings in Judah, but with the important difference that the Sibylline Prophecies were inaccessible, being too sacred to display. Just like ancient Egypt's tomb texts they were, in fact, writings without readers. But this was just the purpose. Their inaccessibility imbued their owners, the ruling élite, with the nimbus of prophecy, reinforcing their power base. The last three scrolls were lost in a conflagration in 83 BC. (Twelve texts believed to be Sibylline Prophecies were discovered in Byzantium many centuries later, then collated in one parchment manuscript published, incompletely, in 1545.) Romans also knew divinations by text, whereby a reader would transform the written word into something neither the author nor society at large saw in it. The text became a private code, in other words, the secret symbol of a binary fortune: boding ill or good, depending on the reader's interpretation, needs or mood. This type of `reading' was exceptionally popular in antiquity. It was reading not for information, erudition, enlightenment or entertainment, but for fortune-telling. A surprisingly strong belief in divining by text obtained in antiquity. Indeed, some believed reading's primary function lay in just such magic. Cicero accused the augur (a religious official who observed and interpreted omens and signs) Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus of having caused in 162 BC `the resignation of the consuls at whose election he had presided in the previous year, basing his decision on a fault in the auspices [auguries from birds], of which he became aware "when reading the books"'.58 In post-Republic Rome readers preferred to use Virgil's poems to tell the future, randomly consulting those scrolls of Virgil's works available at temples dedicated to the goddess Fortuna. This practice, known as the sortes Vergilianæ, was first described when young Hadrian, desirous to learn Emperor Trajan's opinion of him, opened Virgil's Æneid at random to read that Æneas saw `the Roman king whose laws
80 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

shall establish Rome anew'. Hadrian took this to be a positive sign, and acted accordingly. But the Roman Empire never enjoyed such a thing as `popular literature', works personally read by tens or hundreds of thousands. One must even admit that antiquity's two favourites, Homer and Virgil, were almost exclusively learnt through dictation and recitation, not through personal reading. And those monumental Roman funerary inscriptions one still finds from the British Isles to the Middle East? Few such inscriptions were ever truly read by anyone; they were seen instead, helping surviving family members `to maintain or claim a certain rank or respectability'.59 The family members themselves need not have been fully literate. Particularly in later centuries, most were not. Mastery of the written word never had greater regard than among Rome's later emperors, who bestowed on learned teachers the highest authority. This was purposely done to uphold, in the face of barbarian incursions, the literate culture that Rome itself had come to represent, though not encompass. Valentinian I (AD 321­75), for example, emperor of the Western Roman Empire, engaged the Bordeaux-born poet and rhetorician Decimus Magnus Ausonius (died c. AD 393) as tutor to his son Gratian (359­83) who, in turn, once he became emperor, appointed Ausonius to be a Prætorian Prefect or chief magistrate. By then, civil administration was firmly founded on reading and writing. Greek law had furnished authentication of contracts by initially noting them on rolls, then by publishing them in official bureaus for all literate persons to read. About 500 years later Rome achieved something similar with professional scriveners or notaries who, over the succeeding three centuries, came under the supervision of public authorities. Once written contracts became common in the Roman Empire, however, Goths and other Germanic tribes invaded. Yet the system that had been set up functioned so well that the new overlords borrowed and used it, too. (In fact, this became the basis of the mediæval notarial system, which accounted for the greatest frequency of reading and writing in the Middle Ages.) The custom of publicly reading secular works ceased in the sixth century. This had various causes: the patricians vacating large centres, declining education, a weakening book trade,
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 81

Germanic incursions and other changes.60 The vernacularization or `fragmenting' of the Latin tongue was a chief cause. The Christian poet Sidonius Apollinaris (c. AD 433­79), Bishop of Clermont, who gave one of the last known descriptions of a public reading in Rome, complained of Latin having become solely `the language of the [Christian] liturgy, of the chancellaries and of a few scholars'.61 Greek readings were long gone. Public Latin readings endured only in the divine office of the Christian Church. But by then Patristic Latin ­ the Church's adopted written tongue ­ was becoming increasingly unintelligible to most Christians. It had to be interpreted by specially ordained readers who, in time, became a separate caste: the presbyter or `priest'. Yet by the eighth century even many of these presbyters no longer understood the Latin Bible, prayers or hymns they recited at the divine office.

late antiquity and early christianity
Clay tablets could fit in one's palm. Papyrus sheets could be joined to fashion portable scrolls. Both materials served readers well for thousands of years ­ almost perfectly suited, in fact, to their respective society's needs. Then something revolutionary occurred, prompted by a new need. Pliny the Elder (AD 23­79) tells how Eumenes II (ruled 197­158 BC) of Greek Pergamum in Asia Minor, wishing to establish a library to rival the Library of Alexandria, ordered a shipment of papyrus from the Nile.62 But King Ptolemy of Egypt forbade its export, desirous to ensure the Library of Alexandria's pre-eminence as the world's repository of knowledge. Forced to find an alternative, Eumenes ordered his experts to create a new writing material, then, for his library. Whereupon these Eastern Greeks soon perfected a technique of thinly stretching and drying the skin of sheep and goats. The final product of this process eventually became the primary vehicle of a new world faith and the medium of an entire epoch ­ parchment. As early as the first century BC Julius Cæsar had folded a papyrus sheet into individual `pages' for dispatches to his troops in the field. This practice eventually created the codex, a text of
82 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

pages written on both sides for turning, not scrolling. This appeared for the first time near the end of the first century AD, in Rome, its innovator unknown. The first to mention the codex, Martial praises its compactness and points out how it relieves library space. He also mentions its usefulness on a journey for, unlike a scroll, it can be read in one hand:
Homer on parchment pages! The Iliad and all the adventures Of Ulysses, foe of Priam's kingdom, All locked within a piece of skin Folded into several little sheets! 63

The earliest known complete codex or bound volume, discovered in the mid-1980s in the ruins of a fourth-century house at the Dakhleh Oasis in the Sahara, is an estate steward's fouryear record of financial transactions.64 Written in Greek, it comprises eight leaves with four holes (two above and two below) on the left side for the binding cords. Eminently practicable, it clearly served the steward as a durable and portable `pocketbook'. One can assume it typifies the codex format of the first few centuries AD. At first the codex, still of papyrus, was merely a novelty, an object of curiosity. Traditional works were of course expected to be on scrolls. But as parchment gained in popularity, especially when Christians favoured texts on parchment and physicians preferred the codex format because of easier referencing, the codex of bound pages became more fashionable.65 The earliest Greek codex on vellum (fine parchment prepared from the skin of a calf, kid or lamb) is a copy of Homer's Iliad from the third century AD, now in Milan's Biblioteca Ambrosiana; the Iliad could now fit in one parchment codex, rather than in 24 separate papyrus scrolls. As of the first century BC thousands of similar codices would have appeared. Perfectly suiting the codex format, parchment was not only much cheaper than papyrus, but also far more durable and resistant to insects and humidity. Even parchment, however, was too dear for most common purposes, and so the largest part of reading and writing still took
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 83

place on waxed tablets; nearly all correspondence and daily minutiæ were recorded and read on these easily erasable surfaces. Yet more and more parchment sheets were being bound together and sold to allow one to make notes or record sums in primitive notebooks or ledgers. By the third century AD such notebooks were sporting elaborate covers, even of decorated ivory, and were presented to officials on nomination to public office. As especially refined gifts of sophistication, they often included a personal dedication or even a poem inside to mark a special occasion. Makers of papyrus scrolls began favouring these notebooks pre-written with particularly popular poems or small collections of writings, to be presented, much like today's commercial card industry, more for the gesture than the text. In time the bound parchment codices became increasingly popular, and considerable commercial gain could be made from them. Soon the parchment format was rivalling the papyrus scroll for its relative lack of expense, ease of production, greater return on investment, compactness and utility of reading. Parchment had begun seriously competing with papyrus during the first century AD, but by the fourth century had almost wholly replaced it.66 (Papyrus's complete replacement finally occurred in the early Middle Ages, when the trade routes to Egypt were disrupted by the Muslim expansion, halting the export of papyrus.) But parchment was far from the perfect writing material. It, too, was expensive, requiring the skins of costly sheep, lambs, goats and calves. After the fourth century AD the parchment codex ­ or `book' as it came to be called in English (a derivative of Germanic bo ¯ka ¯ or `beech', after the earliest material of rune tablets) ­ remained Europe's preferred literary form. Throughout the Age of Parchment, as the Middle Ages is frequently called, parchment sufficed as a writing material, however, only because demand for writing remained low. (Once the printing press occasioned enormous production runs a thousand years later, expensive parchment was replaced by cheaper paper.) The earliest vellum books were usually of a broad quarto size, a parchment sheet folded twice into four leaves, or eight pages. Its name, quaternio, later inspired our English word
84 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

`quire'. The quire format remained a favourite throughout the Middle Ages. When putting together the quire sheets, book producers normally took care to lay them in such a way that hair-side faced hair-side and flesh-side faced flesh-side, as the two sides of parchment can differ greatly. In this way, two pages of uniform appearance met the eye: either yellow-yellow (hairside) or light-light (flesh-side). Greek books usually began with the lighter flesh-side, Latin with the yellower hair-side.67 Ever increasing use of parchment accompanied Christianity's growth: the first copies of the Bible were vellum codices, a practice that became traditional. Christianity secured the triumph of the parchment codex, indeed created the modern book. A relative late-comer, Christian reading was a direct, hybrid descendant of the Greek, Hebrew and Latin traditions described above. The most ubiquitous book in world history, translated into more languages than any other, the Christian Bible consists of the 39 books of the Old Testament (originally in Hebrew) and 27 books of the New Testament (Greek); the Apocrypha, a collection of other early Christian writings, also survived in Hebrew and Greek. (The status of the Apocrypha has been controversial since the Reformation, when the Vulgate was translated into vernacular languages.) The Vulgate, the Latin translation of the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek, informed the Roman Catholic tradition of the Middle Ages. As early as the fifth century AD, enormous Bibles and other sacred books ­ missals (prayers, rites and so forth of the Mass for a complete year), chorales (metrical hymns sung in unison) and antiphonaries (a bound collection of psalms, hymns and the like, chanted or sung in alternate parts) ­ were displayed on a church's lectern for several readers standing at a distance. Some were so large that lecterns had to be fitted with rollers. The purpose was loud communal reading, especially for choirs, to include as many readers as possible in the celebration of the Mass. (This practice of enormous books with large lettering for choral celebration has continued in the Catholic church up to the present day.) Here, the reader submerses herself or himself in the communal persona, whereby the act of reading becomes group ritual. It is wholly different from the silent, private,
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 85

intimate reading of the later Books of Hours (as of the twelfth century AD). The parchment codex not only allowed Homer in one handy volume. It expanded the auctorial potential far beyond anything the clay tablet or papyrus scroll could encompass. Now the authors of late antiquity, such as Augustine with his City of God and Confessions, or Isidore of Seville (c. AD 560­636) with his Etymologiæ, could undertake a voluminous work knowing it would be contained under one cover, that is, received and understood as a greater intrinsic unity. The new format determined the nature of creative writing itself, in other words, opening up a new dimension of cultural expression in the West. Not being a scroll, the codex could allow easy access to any part of the text for referencing. It also held four margins (top, bottom, left, right), which the reader could fill with glosses, annotations and commentaries, bringing the reader into the written material. The codex's format also prompted innovations in organizing literature: chapters now accommodated subdivisions of a work, and collations called anthologies held several works under one cover. The whole work was one compact body of information, no longer a sequential stringing-out of connected scrolls. A reader now held an immediately accessible entirety. This altered perception of literature has since prevailed. (Only now is `scrolling' returning, in descending Greek fashion, as the computer screen alters modern reading perceptions.) By the close of the fourth century AD the written word's prestige overshadowed oral soothsaying and oracular pronouncements. One now divined using both Virgil and the Bible, the latter practice eventually becoming `gospel cleromancy', still observed in some places today. Patricians continued to collect books to impress, a characteristic foible that had Ausonius mocking:
You've bought books and filled shelves, O Lover of the Muses. Does that mean you're a scholar now? If you buy string instruments, plectrum and lyre today: Do you think that by tomorrow the realm of music will be yours? 68
86 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Even the Germanic `barbarians' were turning to reading and writing. Using the fourth-century AD Greek alphabet, Bishop Wulfila (c. AD 311­83) created `Gothic letters' in order to translate the Bible into his Visigothic language. Other Goths adapted Wulfila's script and wrote religious and other texts, such as deeds (actae), until the eighth century. Only a small number of Goths, however, ever read, these being chiefly churchmen. Reading never permeated Gothic society. Reading actually declined throughout the Roman Empire in every social domain but religious practice. Christianity chiefly succeeded because, being parasitic to Greco-Latin learning, it claimed literature as its own vehicle and thus appealed to the schooled literate. The Church Fathers of the first few centuries AD were all trained in rhetoric; they commanded the classics, then used their literary knowledge to persuade, convince and convert in service of the Church. Plato and the Stoics (who taught that submission to destiny and to natural law brought virtue and happiness) provided the most useful concepts and arguments for these men of learning who accomplished Christianity's `triumph' over paganism in the fourth century AD when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Fundamental to Christianity ­ a faith of reading ­ was the body of writing later called the New Testament. The earliest dated `book' of the New Testament is Paul's letter to the Thessalonians, from AD 50. About four to seven years later, the First Letter to the Corinthians followed, at which time, during Emperor Nero's reign (AD 54­68), Christianity was already being practised as a faith in small cells throughout the Mediterranean. One century later, the Greek Irenæus, Bishop of Lyon, wrote of the composition of the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John):
Thus Matthew published among the Hebrews and in their own language [i.e. Aramaic] a written form of Gospel in the epoch in which Peter and Paul were evangelizing Rome and founding the church there. After their death Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, also transmitted to us in writing what Peter preached. Luke, the companion of Paul,
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 87

consigned in a book the Gospel that the latter preached. Then John, the disciple of the Lord, the very one who had rested on his bosom, also published the Gospel while he was sojourning in Ephesus in Asia.69

Within a span of around 30 years, then, it appears the oral traditions surrounding the life and teachings of Jesus, and the subsequent activities of his disciples and other followers, became a codified collection of texts circulated among the cells of believers to spread the faith through reading and writing. Yet much more remained oral, and was never written down. That the Gospels comprised only a fragment of the much larger oral literature circulating about Jesus was affirmed by John: `And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written' (John XXI:25). There was no need to write them down, for the target audience required quality, not quantity: the essence of the faith, to inspire and convert. In this tone, and with this editing in mind, the New Testament was collated. True `Scripture' remained, for all early Christians, the Old Testament. The veneration of the New Testament, still awaiting sacred status, would come only much later. Even the first Christians practised censorship. When Paul came to Ephesus and preached there for more than two years, the Jews and Greeks were enthused, especially by Paul's healings, and eventually `Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed' (Acts XIX:19-20). A fortune in rare books (since one piece of silver was a day's wage) was burnt on account of religious conviction as a public show of faith: one burnt the book, the pagan belief, as one would burn an enemy, to destroy the competition and erase its knowledge from memory. In time, the Romans turned censorship against the Christians. Yet once Christianity became the state religion, Emperor Constantine, after the Council of Nicæa's condemnation of Arius and his doctrine in AD 325, ordered in turn that all of the Arian sect's books be burnt.
88 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Reversing Greco-Roman tradition, early Christians handed the book to God the Father, God the Son and the holy saints. Even the writings of Paul were regarded as authority, able to stand in court in good stead. When the Governor of Roman Africa was trying some Christians, for example, he asked what they had to defend themselves. `Texts by Paul', they replied, `a just man'.70 That the `impediment to learning', writing, could have replaced legal rhetoric itself, would have astounded Socrates. The Church Fathers were insatiable readers and prolific writers. St Epiphanius (d AD 403) ascribed two thousand original titles to Origen of Alexandria (c. AD 185­c. 254), while St Jerome listed Epiphanius' own 800 titles. Wealthy benefactors endowed these super-scholars with a guaranteed income, residence and small army of secretaries and scribes. Their rapid dictations were legendary. For example, St Jerome was said to have translated the Book of Tobit in one day and the Book of Esther in one night. One of the greatest influences on the written word in the West was St Augustine of Hippo. An impassioned reader as a young man, he was amazed at the mnemonic abilities of a schoolmate who was capable of quoting the penultimate verse of each book of Virgil `quickly, in order and from memory ... If we then asked him to recite the verse before each of those, he did. And we believed that he could recite Virgil backwards ... If we wanted even prose passages from whatever Cicero oration he had committed to memory, that also he could do.' Indeed, Augustine claimed, borrowing a favourite phrase from Cicero, this young scholar was capable of impressing a read text `on the wax tablets of memory'.71 Augustine held that letters of the alphabet were `signs of sounds' that also were `signs of things we think'. For him, such letters had been `invented so that we might be able to converse even with the absent'.72 Reading was thus a conversation with the absent, hearing the spoken word of someone who was not present. Hearing is the pivotal concept here. For with Augustine we first encounter a clear distinction between loud reading and silent reading: between the written word as the human voice and the written word as its own medium. When thirty years of age, in AD 384, Augustine came upon his teacher St Ambrose (c. 340­97), Bishop of Milan, silently reading to himself:
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 89

... when he was reading, he drew his eyes along over the leaves, and his heart searched into the sense, but his voice and tongue were silent. Oft-times when we were present ... we still saw him reading to himself, and never otherwise ... But with what intent soever he did it, that man certainly had a good meaning in it.73

It appears that silent reading was something surprisingly rare at the time, otherwise Augustine would never have made such a comment. Some scholars hold that `ancient books were normally read aloud, but there is nothing to show that silent reading of books was anything extraordinary'.74 However, only a handful of passages in antiquity attest to silent reading.75 For example, in Euripides' Hippolytus (fifth century BC) Theseus silently reads a letter his dead wife is holding. In Aristophanes' The Knights (fifth century BC) Demosthenes wordlessly regards a writing tablet that an oracle had sent, and shows surprise at its contents. Plutarch describes in his Parallel Lives how, in the fourth century BC, Alexander the Great silently reads a letter from his mother while his troops, watching, were amazed by the ability. In his Moralia, Plutarch further writes of Alexander breaking the seal of a confidential letter from his mother and beginning silently to read to himself, whereupon his bosom friend Hephæstion comes up to silently read the letter alongside.76 Plutarch records, too, how Julius Cæsar, alongside his rival Cato in the Senate in 63 BC, mutely read a short love letter from Cato's sister.77 (Here, the ostentatious act of silent reading, which was Cæsar's ruse, aroused Cato's suspicion, who announced a conspiracy; Cæsar was `compelled', then, to reveal the love letter from Cato's sister, doubly humiliating his rival ­ Cæsar's intention all along.) Providing consolation to the deaf in one of his essays, Cæsar's contemporary Cicero offered the advice: `If they happen to enjoy recitations, they should first remember that before poems were invented, many wise men lived happily; and second, that much greater pleasure can be had in reading these poems than in hearing them'.78 In the second century AD, the Greek astronomer, mathematician and geographer Ptolemy
90 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

noted that people occasionally read silently to themselves when concentrating on a subject, as giving voice to the words distracted from thought.79 In a lecture perhaps delivered during Lent in AD 349, St Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315­86) appealed to his women parishioners, while they were waiting during the ceremonies, to read `quietly, however, so that, while their lips speak, no other ears may hear what they say'.80 The passage is remarkable in three ways. First, it describes a silent mouthing of written language; even today, when reading difficult material, people often move their lips, as if the phonology were needed in order to assist comprehension. In the fourth century such mute mouthing may have been needed to parse, or segment, the run-together words on the page. (Regular word separation did not become common again until the ninth century AD; shortly after this silent reading became common, chiefly prompted by regular word separation.) Second, each woman parishioner is able to read, revealing a surprising degree of literacy among Jerusalem's Christian females. And third, each appears to possess a prayer book or hymnal: it was a rich parish indeed that could afford private books. Augustine speculated about Ambrose's silent reading: `Perhaps he was afraid that if he read out loud, a difficult passage by the author he was reading would raise a question in the mind of an attentive listener, and he would then have to explain what it meant or even argue about some of the more abstruse points'.81 In other words, silent reading protected Ambrose from interruption, thus permitting a one-to-one, more profound relationship with the written text. Augustine's speculation suggests his own intimate appreciation of reading's individualistic potential, one that would only become universal during the Middle Ages. Augustine himself, despite his surprise at his teacher's ability, read silently on occasion. At a moment of great personal turmoil, Augustine, who had been reading aloud Paul's Epistles to his friend Alypius in Augustine's summer garden but had walked away to weep alone, overheard a child chanting the refrain tolle, lege (`take up and read').82 Inspired, Augustine returned to Alypius to seize the book and wordlessly read to himself ­ and
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 91

`the darkness of doubt' was dispelled. When Alypius asked what had moved him, Augustine, who had closed the book on one finger, opened the text and Alypius read, aloud this time, not Augustine's passage but one further along that moved Alypius equally strongly. Augustine loved Latin, his native tongue, but resented Greek. Because of Augustine's influence on Christianity, his was the major contribution in the shift from Greek to Latin reading in the West, setting the foundation for what has been labelled the `Latin Middle Ages'. Of course Greek continued to thrive after Augustine, mainly for the Byzantine Empire and its impact on Arab scholarship. But Greek was to remain, at least in Western Europe, secondary to Latin forever after. Christianity's earliest known library appeared in Rome's church of S Lorenzo, founded by Pope Damasus I some time in the 380s. It housed the various books of the Bible, biblical commentaries, works of the Greek apologists (who defended by written argument the Christian faith against Rome's earlier belief system), as well as a selection of Greek and Latin classics. The position of pre-Christian literature in the early Church was often simply a matter of taste. Sidonius even chided a friend for having separated his library into classical and Christian authors, the former next to the gentlemen's seats, the latter next to the ladies' seats!83 Most early Church Fathers found Greek and Latin classics to be eminently readable, as their works seemed to prefigure Christian teachings. Indeed, in his De doctrina christiana Augustine claimed authors like Aristotle and Virgil had `unjustly possessed the truth'. The entire legacy of classical antiquity was now borne by the new Christian Church. As of the fifth century AD this was becoming missionary and monastic. Reading featured prominently, as each Christian monk was to devote many hours a day, if possible, to reading Scripture. Instrumental in the emergent institutionalization of reading was St Benedict of Nursia (c. 480­c. 547), who founded a monastery at Monte Cassino (c. 529), on a hill between Naples and Rome. Among the many rules that Benedict laid down for his `Benedictines' to follow ­ the written code meant to preclude the pre-eminence of any abbot ­ was this addressing reading:
92 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

At the meal time of the brothers, there should always be reading; no one may dare to take up the book at random and begin to read there; but he who is about to read for the whole week shall begin his duties on Sunday. And, entering upon his office after Mass and Communion, he shall ask all to pray for him, that God may avert from him the spirit of elation. And this verse shall be said in the oratory three times by all, he however beginning it: `O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise'. And thus, having received the benediction, he shall enter upon his duties as reader. And there shall be the greatest silence at table, so that no whispering or any voice save the reader's may be heard. And whatever is needed, in the way of food, the brethren should pass to each other in turn, so that no one need ask for anything.84

Benedict's Regula monachorum was to become the model Rule of all monastic orders in Western Christendom. Benedict stipulated three hours of daily reading in summer, two in winter. During Lent, the 40 weekdays commemorating Jesus's fasting in the wilderness, each monk was to read one complete volume. On any journey, a monk was to carry along a small book. And during all meals and before compline (the last of the seven canonical hours, just before retiring) monks were of course to be read to: a rhythmical, chant-like style of reading intended to exercise the mind and to commit holy texts to memory. Benedict also instructed his monks to hold, if possible, the books they were reading `in their left hands, wrapped in the sleeve of their tunics, and resting on their knees; their right hands shall be uncovered with which to grip and turn the pages'. Benedict's reading at Monte Cassino, and at all subsequent foundations that followed his Rule, reversed the customary practices of secular reading. This was special reading, in that it comprised limited titles and addressed a unique, confined audience. It was exclusively sacred, authoritative and involuntary, whereby emotions and critical faculties were banned. Some of it was private and silent: tacite legere or legere sibi, to use Benedict's own phrases. Most was public and loud, however: not to learn
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 93

and grow, nor even to be entertained, but to lose oneself in the common indoctrination. It was not individual liberation, but communal submersion, not unlike the text-read megaphone indoctrination of twentieth-century labour camps. It is not surprising, then, to find the repeated mastication of divine fare as a frequent metaphor in Christian writings of the era.85 The Roman statesman Cassiodorus (c. 490­c. 585) retired in his early sixties to found a monastery at Vivarium in Calabria, where, unlike Benedict, he encouraged fellow monks to read both the classics and sacred writings. Still, he emphasized the classics should be read only as a means to better understand the Bible and Church Fathers. Towards this end Cassiodorus had books imported from North Africa, then a great centre of the early Church, which he stored at his monastery in nine large cabinets.86 Pictures, too, were often `read' as symbols in antiquity and early Christianity. The picture of a deity's attribute would stand for the deity herself or himself. In this way, the hearth was Vesta, the herald's staff and winged travelling-cap were Mercury, the lightning bolt was Jupiter, and so forth. Animals could also become a god's symbol, such as the eagle for Jupiter. Scenes from literature adorned wealthy patricians' walls, reminding them of favourite passages from, most commonly, Homer and Virgil. Through such scenes, the non-reader ­ a learned listener who was often as versed as any literate ­ would recall line and verse the moment the eye took it in. This, too, was a frequent form of `reading', as it evoked the spoken language, though not through written symbols. In the first or second century AD scenes depicting episodes in Jesus's life were doubtless adorning early Christians' walls, too. The early Church also adopted Roman iconographic practices, using symbols for attributes, such as the Evangelists John, Mark and Luke as the eagle, lion and bull, respectively, or the dove for the Holy Spirit and the lamb for Christ. The substitutions later took on individual qualities: the lamb was no longer only Christ, but Christ's sacrificial quality; the dove was no longer only the Holy Spirit, but the quality of eternal redemption.87 The images swelled with the centuries, so that a vast `lexicon' of Christian concepts was expressed through
94 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

them. The Old Testament could thus be related and linked to the New Testament, continuing the policy of spiritual continuity the early Church had followed textually. As St Augustine had affirmed: `The New Testament lies hidden in the Old, while the Old is disclosed in the New'. One of the earliest examples of Christian iconography linking Old and New Testament scenes to be `read' simultaneously appears on two door panels in the church of S Sabina, Rome, carved c. 430. Anyone familiar with the Bible would immediately recognize here the miracles of Christ opposite those of Moses. Those not familiar would either have to invent a story or ask someone what it told. Over the centuries curiosity won countless converts. For this reason, when asked for advice about decorating a church St Nilus of Ancyra (d c. AD 430) suggested Bible scenes on either side of the Holy Cross, which would `serve as books for the unlearned, teach them scriptural history and impress on them the record of God's mercies'.88 The practice has continued up to the present day. Written culture in antiquity was generally restricted to a small number of privileged persons. None the less, in cities with large populations (such as Rome, with around half a million inhabitants) there were thousands who read, wrote, listened and actively participated in and benefited from written language. Throughout antiquity, reading and writing coexisted with all aspects of traditional oral culture. Those who could read and write widened pre-existent class differences, as they also participated in and contributed to civic management, military command and expansion of empire. After Greece's and Rome's archaic periods, the privileged class came to depend on reading and writing. Everyone else in society surely felt their effect. Yet the oral dictate so prevailed that reading was universally perceived as nothing more than written speech, a sophisticated form of hearing. Reading's true potential mostly lay unrecognized. Human memory was more actively cultivated and relied on. And it was extremely expensive to own books in antiquity ­ and difficult, too, if one did not live in a metropolis. Even fully literate Greeks and Romans seldom owned papyrus scrolls or parchment codices, and thus only
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 95

infrequently arrived at, through personal reading, a knowledge of the greater world or innovative thought. Nearly all literate Greeks and Romans used their ability to read and write to keep accounts, follow local elections, carry on correspondence and a number of other things that only rarely included literature. Because of these circumstances, one certainly cannot speak of mass literacy in antiquity. The literate society still lay nearly two thousand years distant. Still, many acknowledged literacy's primacy. A contemporary of Emperor Augustus, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, for one, had to confess that
it is by means of [literacy] that the most important and the most useful of life's business is completed ­ votes, letters, testaments, laws, and everything else which puts life on the right track. For who could compose a worthy encomium of literacy? For it is by means of writing alone that the dead are brought to the minds of the living, and it is through the written word that people who are spatially very far apart communicate with each other as if they were nearby. As to treaties made in time of war between peoples or kings, the safety provided by the written word is the best guarantee of the survival of the agreement. Generally it is this alone which preserves the finest sayings of wise men and the oracles of the gods, as well as philosophy and all of culture, and hands them on to succeeding generations for all time. Therefore, while it is true that nature is the cause of life, the cause of the good life is education based on the written word.89

The finest literary productions, written in the most sophisticated scripts, were undertaken for Homer in Greek and for Virgil in Latin for many centuries on papyrus scrolls. The Biblia Sacra, the Latin Bible, in a vellum codex, superseded these within the first few centuries of the Christian Church. Such publications were more highly valued and better looked after than others, and large numbers of them were produced.90 Testifying to the increasing sophistication of the written word and the society it served, oral poetry became literary poetry already in antiquity. Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, for example, are
96 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

`primary' or oral epics: their original purpose being recitation, their principal attributes were construction, narrative appeal and story presentation. Virgil's Æneid, on the other hand, is a `secondary' or literary epic, its principal attributes lying in the individuality and grandeur of literary style and diction. This was clearly the consequence of reading and writing on a grand scale, undertaken by the thousands of literates in ancient Rome. Such a literary, as opposed to oral, composition also informed the New Testament, the hybrid product of Greek and Jewish traditions. The New Testament came to experience among Christians a similar veneration to that of the Jews towards the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible. Transposed to and transformed on the Italian peninsula, this veneration for sacred scripture set the foundation for the Latin Middle Ages. Classical texts seem verbose to us today, and with good reason. They are, by all modern standards, bombastic, pretentious, disorganized, repetitious, even scattered, filled with digressions and incidentals. For it is the literature of a speechbased, not a text-based, society. Orator-authors prioritized other things, their audiences comprising more listeners than readers. To enjoy these texts today we should actually read them aloud with gesticulations, perhaps imagining before us an atrium filled with smiling toga-clad relatives, nodding wellwishers and cheering sycophants. And ecce: the text suddenly springs to life. It was only in the later centuries of antiquity ­ when Greek, Jewish and Latin cultures informed the `Christian culture' that would infuse the Middle Ages with other values, priorities and practices ­ that reading turned more introspective and silent, the private pursuit, the inner quest. As early Greeks and Romans had experienced the `papyrus tongue' that transformed reading into a popular oral tool for accessing information, their descendants came to know the `parchment eye' that imparted Faith itself in solitary silence. Yet beyond the Mediterranean's sway lay an entire world of reading.
