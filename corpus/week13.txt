introduction
Jonathan Goodwin

There was almost universal enthusiasm for the perceived novelty and brilliance of Franco Moretti's project in our book event, the third such event the Valve has hosted. Inter- and multi-disciplinarity is both praised and reviled by many academics; there is a sense that traditional disciplines are outmoded administrative conveniences but also suspicion of the possibility of mastering another field in an era of hyperspecialization. As a way of helping to assess this phenomenon in literary history and criticism, I will briefly discuss the use of interdisciplinary techniques in Moretti's previous work, with special attention to the concepts borrowed from evolutionary biology. Afterwards, I will give an overview of the contributions in the present volume, many of which take as their starting point Moretti's interest in evolution. Purchasers of the most recent edition of Moretti's collection of essays, Signs Taken for Wonders, may have noticed that the essay "On Literary Evolution" was not included. According to Moretti, this was an oversight. I mention this because many of the ideas that would lead to GMT are first presented here, and I wondered briefly if it were deliberately left out of the collection due to obsolescence. Moretti uses an evolutionary metaphor at the beginning of the essay. He argues that a Lamarckian understanding of evolution, one where variations are goal-oriented, characterizes the understanding of culture and of theories of history derived from Hegel. He suggests that instead it might be useful to apply a Darwinian understanding to this aspect of cultural evolu ix

tion: what if variations in literary history are not teleological, and to explore the consequences of this postulate. Moretti proposes first that chance generates rhetorical variations in literary history, with social necessity then selecting some of these variations (263). He borrows from Gould and Eldredge's concept of punctuated equilibrium to describe the "long periods of boredom, short periods of terror" (268) in the development of literary forms. Hans Robert Jauss's account of the success of the literary work being proportional to its distance from the age's horizon of expectations is, for Moretti, essentially monistic. The Italian critic Francesco Orlando's concept of "figurality rate," which Moretti closely identifies with literary complexity, provides a means of evaluating the micro-historical literary evolution process. (Moretti also uses some ideas about complexity theory from Prigogine and Stengers here to suggest the non-predictability of rapid conceptual change in the historical process.) The startling claim that follows is that the density of modernist poetry, with its never-beforeequaled figurality rate, arises as an exaptation (in Gould and Vrba's sense, the use of a trait or the combination of traits out of contingency rather than as a selected-for adaptation) from the development of ambiguity in the monologue in the tragic plot. Moretti's next work, The Way of the World, The Bildungsroman in European Culture, mentions the realization he had about the Russian Formalists' critical novelty after reading Gould and Eldredge (247 n11) and also deploys the punctuated equilibrium concept to describe rapid conceptual change (232). The essay, "A Useless Longing for Myself. The Crisis of the European Bildungsroman, 1898-1914" also specifically invokes the punctuated equilibrium metaphor. I mention this because it leads to one of the key observations that underlies GMT and was explicitly developed in work beginning with "Conjectures on World Literature" and "The Slaughterhouse

of Literature" in addition to Atlas of the European Novel, 1800-1900: that the canon is very small. Therefore, the new forms that develop and drive literary evolution emerge out of long periods of non-canonical stasis and lack of differentiation. The change in Moretti's project that begins around The Atlas of the European Novel depends on the realization that, while the canonical texts are the bottlenecks of literary evolution, that they cannot be studied in isolation. He humorously describes close reading as a "secularized theology" emanating from New Haven ("Slaughterhouse" 208), and suggests that, to understood world literature in its context, that "distant reading" has to replace it ("Conjectures" 56). The great unread mass must be studied in order to see macroevolutionary patterns in literary history. The canonical texts are those which persist from generation-to-generation. They have the ability, even if they are not immediately popular, to entice readers to discover their virtues. (Moretti describes a similar dynamic with the worldwide reaction to the Hollywood film in "Planet Hollywood.") In a footnote, Moretti mentions that both The Red and the Black and Moby Dick, two conventional counterexamples, went through many editions in the era when they are claimed to have been ignored or unappreciated ("Slaughterhouse" 210 n4). Contributor to this volume Cosma Shalizi wrote a useful review of Atlas of the European Novel, 1800-1900 in which he took Moretti to task for some failure to use all of the statistical tools at his disposal. He found Moretti's project interesting enough to review however, and he is a statistical physicist by trade. I will discuss Shalizi's ideas about Moretti in more detail a bit later, but I bring this up to highlight the self-conscious novelty of Moretti's scientific approach. Critics might, and I believe have, called it "scientistic," an insult as deadly as "positivist" in literary studies. Though I do not agree with this assessment, I feel that the abstract and scientific basis ("a

xii 

Jonathan Goodwin

more rational literary history") is so central to Moretti's project that it should be discussed. Shalizi tweaks some humanistic noses a bit in his review, noting that Moretti is able to quote from the popular writings of Darwin and Kuhn's Structure intelligently, leaving the reader to infer that this is rare. As we have seen, Moretti's range of reference to evolutionary biology is heavily inclined toward Gould, and the ideas of exaptation and punctuated equilibrium do transfer well to literary studies. (In one of his responses in this volume, Moretti notes that he is not impressed with many of the current efforts in literary studies to use evolutionary approaches. Most of these have been strongly influenced by strains of evolutionary psychology, and Gould's polemic against that, and, in the larger context, the strong adaptationism of Dawkins and Dennett, seems to have influenced him as well.) As the foreword to GMT notes, Moretti was trained in a Marxist tradition that emphasized the scientific search for truth and objectivity and reacted against the discipline's turn to French and German metaphysics (2). Alberto Piazza, one of the authors of The Human Geography of Genes, writes an afterword to GMT which discusses the potential usefulness of evolutionary concepts in literary studies from the perspective of a population geneticist. Piazza identifies genetic drift as an important concept in cultural transmission which would need further elaboration in Moretti's model (104). Piazza notes the the phylogenetic tree in molecular biology presupposes no natural selection effects, since the convergences and divergences exhibited by selective pressure would cancel each other out, but that the trees devised by Moretti are primarily interested in the selected-for effects. (Piazza also notes the presence of Mayr's allopatric speciation in Moretti's work on the spread of free indirect style, another major evolutionary theoretical concept used to illustrate a pattern in literary history.) The use of phylo-

Introduction

genetic trees in evolutionary biology, according to Piazza, is best suited to the history of a gene. The autonomous aspects of the unit in question in Moretti's literary analysis and how it can be compared to the biological concept of a gene is discussed briefly in my contribution to this volume. Before turning to an overview of this volume's contents, I will briefly review the illuminating exchange between Moretti and Christopher Prendergast in the New Left Review on GMT. Prendergast argues that Moretti does not have a causal mechanism to explain why readers of Arthur Conan Doyle selected "clues" as the main determinant of his popularity, and Moretti answers that, while he did propose a black box type of mechanism here, he now believes that cognitive science might provide an explanatory mechanism (75), it's worth noting that Moretti cites Steven Johnson's entry in this volume--and personal communication resulting from it, as the source of this insight). The major theoretical problem that Prendergast identifies in GMT is that Moretti posits a divergent model of cultural evolution whereas the presiding explanations for models of cultural change emphasize convergence. The persistence of symbolic forms, for Moretti, is why literary history branches rather than amalgamates. A recurrent point in Moretti's response to Prendergast is the distinction proposed by Noam Chomsky between problems and mysteries. Problems have a field of conceptual understanding; not everything is known but the contours of inquiry are well-established. Progress has been charted and will continue. Mysteries, on the other hand, are not understood. Progress has not been made on them, though their formulation dates to antiquity. Moretti ends his response by noting that the concepts he has addressed in GMT are largely mysteries, whereas Prendergast's specific criticisms suggest that they are problems. The abstractional techniques are exploratory measures designed to reduce mysteries to problems, as Chomsky has described his work in linguistics.

Moretti concludes with a reconsideration of the liberatory or demystifying potential of his project, an aspect of his work important since his Marxist formation. I will now review how the essays in this volume deal with the challenges Moretti makes to literary history. John Holbo begins his entry by observing that literary scholarship is not entirely cumulative. For Holbo, literary scholars have a culture of ignoring each other's arguments and "results," such as they are, and operate in a type of hermetic isolation. The comments to Holbo's post pressed him on this point, with "CR," an assistant professor, describing his experiences having his articles rejected because they did not do enough of just what Holbo had said literary scholars never do: cite other people's work and place theirs in the larger context. The miscommunication here seemed based on a different methodological understanding: from John Holbo's perspective in philosophy and his concurrent interest in the philosophical basis of literary theory in the Continental tradition, the narrowing of a problem-set based on successive attempts seems a definingly absent trend in literary studies. From CR's perspective, the almost ritualistic obeisance required to a "methodology" or tradition of readings of a given text is itself stifling. Ray Davis criticizes Moretti for what seem to be surprising conceptual omissions: philosophy and cognitive science. As we have seen, Moretti does agree about the importance of mental models for understanding the evolution of literary forms. And, though it is specifically the French/German metaphysical tradition that Moretti is reluctant to engage, it is interesting to consider to what extent writers in that tradition could illuminate his project. Matthew Kirschenbaum describes what was known as the `nora project', which is now known as the `monk project'. Kirschenbaum's entry deals mostly with the project's digital humanities and data mining initatives and only tangentially with Moretti's work. At the same time, however, it is argu-

Introduction

 xv

ably the most relevant entry to the future of what Moretti proposes here because of the role digitization and database searches will play in the next generation of "distant readings." (Moretti's "The Novel: History and Theory" contains the following: "With digital databases, this is now easy to imagine: a few years, and we'll be able to search just about all novels that have ever been published, and look for patterns among billions of sentences" (114), for example.) With the automatic searching and identifying of generic features, the production and analysis of the data similar to what Moretti does in GMT will be able to happen with much larger sample sizes and, therefore, much greater accuracy. Some generic features are obviously more subject to automated recognition than others. Free indirect style, for instance, is easier to recognize than "clues." Timothy Burke makes a number of wide-ranging observations in his essay. He draws on his experience as an Africanist historian to note that even what makes its way in the archive, vast as it is, is still only a small sample of the total number of cultural objects in circulation. (Presumably it's a large enough sample that statistical inferences from it can be made, but the point about it being a sample is clearly important here.) Curiously enough, Burke suggests that Moretti has too gradualist an approach to evolutionary metaphors, which suggests that even a writer as enamored of the punctuated metaphors as Moretti can be criticized by a cultural historian impressed with the power of the idea. Burke also argues that Moretti should be more interested in complexity theory and emergence, a topic which does show up in the "On Literary Evolution" essay from Signs Taken for Wonders. But more attention to what is clearly an important analytic problem is needed for the long-term viability of Moretti's project. (Piazza's afterword notes the severe problems introduced into quantitative analysis by disturbingly common non-linear processes.)

Adam Roberts, inspired by the generational model of genre development in GMT, outlines a generic history of science fiction in the next article. Based largely on his The History of Science Fiction, Roberts proposes a development of successive genres since Kepler's Somnium and suggests that they would follow a pattern, if graphed, similar to that of Figure 9 of GMT, "British Novelistic Genres, 1740-1900" (19). The difficulty in both of these graphs is disagreement about the morphology of the genres, as both Moretti and Roberts note. Bill Benzon then raises the issue of cognitive maps and where they fit in with Moretti's geographical ones. I found this to be a particularly interesting issue, especially given Moretti's theoretical background. Benzon raises the quite interesting point about what degree of geographical accuracy could be expected from the authors of the various novels Moretti lists. He cites a Donald Norman experiment where graduate students could not accurately map the apartments they lived in while they were in those apartments, yet they presumably never had trouble navigating them. The distance between the cognitive map and the unconscious understanding of the environment is another issue where research in cognitive science could supplement Moretti's research aims. Eric Hayot's piece is the first to address the academic sociology of Moretti's project. As he describes, there is both considerable joy at the novelty and deep suspicion at not just the perceived scientism but also the attitude that the "secular theology" of close reading has been blasphemed against. Hayot uses Lindsay Waters' argument against the elimination of joy and the erotics of reading in modern hermeneutics as polar opposite of Moretti's work. Hayot is not so willing to dismiss either explicitly or tacitly the status quo as most of our contributors seem to do, at least for the purposes of evaluating Moretti's argument, and his contribution is salutary in that regard, especially for reminding us just how radical and how much of an outsider project this is. My brief essay attempts to

Introduction

 xvii

examine what, if anything, the concept of the "ideologeme" adds to Moretti's theoretical framework. Coming as it does with a rich Marxian pedigree, I suggest that "ideologemes," if adequately defined, would serves as a useful analogy to the suspicious "memes" of sociobiology. I noted earlier that Moretti quoted Steven Berlin Johnson's contribution in his response to Prendergast in the NLR. Johnson's point about needing a plausible psychological model to explain formal invention and reception was identified as an important area for future research. It is where my own interests in Moretti's project mostly lie, and one of the reasons that I was initially drawn to Moretti's work. In the comments to Johnson's entry, both Bill Benzon and Ray Davis elaborate on the need for a psychological theory of aesthetics, one that takes into account scientific research and that does not, as Davis points out, rely too heavily on facile generalization. It is a hard problem, and I find the appearance of it in the discussion of a book that's resolutely sociological in its focus to be interesting and refereshing. Jenny Davidson criticizes Moretti for failing to recognize the points of contact between his own project and the feminist tradition of recovery, especially insofar as many of the same texts and periods are covered by both. Much of Moretti's work tries to establish the basis for canon formation, not critique it as such. Davidson usefully refers to other work whose scope and aims are similar to Moretti's: Wai Chee Dimock's two articles, "Planetary Time and Global Translation: `Context' in Literary Studies" and "Genre as World System: Epic and Novel on Four Continents," are both, especially in their deployment of self-similarity in what Davidson calls a response to historicism, especially illuminating in this regard. In a challenge to Moretti's emphasis on divergence in cultural evolution, Davidson claims that contingency has been widely accepted as a facet of culture. In the Marxian tradition, however, teleology is far more important than contingency

xviii 

Jonathan Goodwin

and might even have been considered heretical at times. The importance of contingency as a role in cultural evolution and historical understanding is a popular subject certainly; witness the long-standing tradition of alternative history writing. But I agree with Moretti that the emphasis on contingency and variation as a generative principle is in fact contrary to the dominant models of cultural and literary history. John Holbo's second post raises the exciting theoretical question of marketing. The influence of advertising on the spread of formal devices does seem to be, as Holbo claims, an elided aspect of Moretti's analysis. Particularly now, when the statistical sophistication and database extensiveness of the modern marketing industry has exceeded even the most utopian proto-fantasies of a Leopold Bloom, the question of how markets are malleable through indirect interference and manipulation seems crucial. Moretti's work on the Hollywood film does seem to suggest that it is the genre or the formal aspects of film itself which create its market. The words "advertising" and "marketing" do not appear in "Planet Hollywood," for instance. Holbo reintroduces "dumb luck" into the equation with the inexplicably huge success of J. K. Rowling. Davidson notes in the comments that Rowling's work seesa simply not as good (formally inventive, complex, satisfying) as that of at least some of her peers, so some regression to the mean of popular taste would have to be a factor. She also claims that this is not the case with Doyle; compared to his peers, he is a better, more complex writer, a claim which Moretti's analysis would seem to support. In his response to this round of inquiries, Moretti invokes a principle from the study of dynamic non-linear systems: that there must be a small initial difference in morphology of form that accounts for the large-scale change in magnitude seen in the market results. Sean McCann begins by making the same observation that Jenny Davidson did: that Moretti is a singular figure in

Introduction

 xix

literary studies who will inspire no school of research because of several factors, the most important of which is that only he is capable of doing these kinds of projects in a way that holds others' interests. Though I disagree with this claim, I recognize its force. Prendergast makes a similar observation in his long response to GMT. If it were not for Moretti's unique theoretical trajectory, coming as he does from a background in Marxist aesthetics, the project would immediately recall a sterile positivist approach associated by Prendergast with Gustave Lanson (43), in particular. McCann identifies two environments of Moretti's analysis: the market and the mental. According to McCann, Moretti's market environment requires a different selection agent than the social environment, so the evolutionary analogy between them needs further development Here again is another instance in which a cognitive scientific approach would advance the ideas found in GMT. I also think that Moretti would not as easily accept the distinction between these two types of environments. This brings us at last to the final and longest essay in the collection, Cosma Shalizi's "Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing." Shalizi begins his essay by noting that Moretti invited him to participate in a seminar on the future of the novel after reading his review of Atlas of the European Novel. Cosma Shalizi is, as he himself notes, perhaps the ideal reader of a project like Moretti's, combining statistical expertise with considerable polymathy. In the first section of his essay, Shalizi applies statistical analysis to Moretti's claim that clusters of genre appear and disappear within a generation. He finds that they do, but admonishes Moretti that the point of quantitative data is to enable precise inference, so there is no need to return to intuitive analysis. I do not know the extent to which Moretti consulted a statistician in the writing of GMT, but it is a complex discipline whose results famously contradict intuition on occasion. (Moretti does

xx 

Jonathan Goodwin

cite Hacking's The Taming of Chance several times in earlier work.) The distinctiveness of each textual unit that makes up a genre and how that fact compares to population biology is next point Shalizi emphasizes. If you classify texts purely according to morphology, then phylogenetic similarity is sacrificed. Does that level of the metaphor extend? This is one of the questions that I asked in my contribution, which started by raising the notion of "memes" or the ideologeme as a constraining unit of cultural heredity (as I have to agree with Prendergast and, presumably, everyone else, that literature does not have genes as such). The next point of contention has also been raised by Prendergast in his essay, though Shalizi approaches it from a broader (and more critical) perspective. The Hegelian notion of "expressive totality" (the phrase seems to be Althusser's) and the interpretive problems that result from trying to make complex inferences about the social world from a sample size, often, of one cultural object, disturbs Shalizi. He offers the surprising and useful observation that comparative methods taken from the biological sciences which use lattices capable of modeling such phenomenon as lateral-gene transfer would not depend on the determination of whether or not literature had "discretevalued, particulate factors, such as genes." As I have written earlier, this question seems to me fundamental in assessing the likely success of Moretti's approach, and I find this type of modeling, as of yet unattempted, to the best of my knowledge, to be an exciting opportunity. Another issue where Shalizi differs from Moretti is in his distinction between the social forces causing a change in taste and those "which shape the content of the taste." Shalizi, following Stanley Lieberson's A Matter of Taste, suggests that these two forces have to be distinguished and do not always have a determinative relation. Such an idea is deeply antithetical to the main tenets of Marxian thought, however, not

Introduction

 xxi

least of which to the expressive totality and teleology of form that Moretti remains influenced by. One new wrinkle Shalizi provides in the repeated idea seen in many of the entries here that a psychological understanding of formal reception and change is needed is to appeal to the empirical studies done of reading and response. The literature that Shalizi refers to, while certainly noteworthy and interesting in itself, will not readily satisfy many comparatists covering the same literary ground as Moretti because of the vast gulf between the highly aestheticized type of reading they are accustomed and the presumably sterile and artificial experiments that can be studied with empirical methods. (Norm Holland's 5 Readers Reading is an earlier and useful addition to the list of relevant works that Shalizi mentions here.) Empirical studies of reader-response are also far removed from Moretti's description of close-reading as a secular theology. Shalizi concludes his essay with the comforting thought that the randomness inherent in human history and cultural products of that history, have, by that very randomness, "strict nonrandom regularity," which can be analyzed using methods such as Moretti's or by the more traditional technique of close reading. That seemingly paradoxical--yet pleasing--idea seems as good as place as any to conclude this introduction. I do want to mention that the comments made throughout the book event were unusually substantive and provocative. Please browse around in the archive, no matter how you happen to be reading.

John Holbo
Moretti opens "Graphs" by remarking,
what a minimal fraction of the literary field we all work on: a canon of two hundred novels, for instance, sounds very large for nineteenth-century Britain (and is much larger than the current one), but is still less than one per cent of the novels that were actually published: twenty thousand, thirty, more, no one really knows--and close reading won't help here, a novel a day every day of the year would take a century or so.

This reminds me of a point made in my inaugural Valve post. How many members in the MLA? The large number is largely a function of the number of college courses that need teaching, freshman essays that need marking, not really at all a function of any independent conception of a humanistic knowledge edifice that needs approximately twenty or thirty thousand toiling professorial hands--obliged to produce, yes even over-produce. Call this dynamic of superfluity `sorcerer's apprentice syndrome'. It's not the worst problem, but it deserves address from every promising angle. Moretti's project presents a fresh angle: an institutionally vast discipline should try to find projects suitable for pursuit by vast numbers of scholars. Actually existing academic literary studies makes considerably more sense if something like
 3

4 

John Holbo

Moretti's project makes sense. So, on behalf of the institution, there should be a concerted effort to make sense of such projects. Which is no guarantee sense can be made. (Nor am I proposing all English professors be conscripted as Moretti's research assistants. No, not at all.) Let me make the same point a different way (anticipating and answering an objection.) In his second paragraph Moretti lists a number of scholars on whose work he builds. "I mention these names right away because quantitative work is truly cooperation: not only in the pragmatic sense that it takes forever to gather the data, but because such data are ideally independent from any individual researcher, and can thus be shared by others, and combined in more than one way." Examples follow: graphs charting the take-off of the novel in Britain, Japan, Italy, Spain and Nigeria; data amounting to knowledge that could not plausibly be approximated by anything in an intuitive, appreciative head--however prodigiously well-read: an Easter Island-style monument. Like Harold Bloom, say. But now the inevitable objection: to suggest that literary studies take the quantitative turn is preposterous, Gradgrindian positivism. I am sure Moretti gets this a lot, so he surely has his answer down pat, but I'll make one on his behalf (which is therefore not necessarily his.) Just as we are accustomed to the existence of a standing army of academic literary critics, so that we should be pinched from time to time, to wake up to how strange this institution is--how obscure in its actual, aggregate intellectual (as opposed to pedagogic) function. I think we are overly accustomed to the profound lack of cooperation that is the hallmark of humanities research. We could use occasional reminders of this very fact. Most literary scholars would no more simply use the `results' of a fellow scholar than they would use her toothbrush (I heard that joke somewhere.) Not without first

transforming, interrogating, refashioning so that this implement is made the new possessor's own. To look at a shelf of journals and see, mostly, rows of used toothbrushes, is not an energizing prospect, however. I don't mean to be apocalyptic about it. It's a peculiar situation, not the Downfall of Western Civilization. I also don't mean to suggest the problem is unique to English professors. (I think the original toothbrush joke was about professors generally, or maybe it was even about scientists.) But the problem is as acute in literary studies as anywhere, so it may as well be addressed here. I am personally in a position to say it is less severe in philosophy departments, where there is more consensus about what counts as an argument, hence more neutral portability of certain products. But, of course, portability does not automatically equate to intellectual value. Perhaps the philosophy department has purchased communication at the cost of significance, declining into a sort of puzzle-piece scholasticism, which likes to pretend it is brick-on-brick scientism. But scholasticism is at least a presumptively seemly ethos for scholars. That is something. Given the fact that there are so many scholars, they ought to be seeking ways to make themselves more ... scholastic--while fending off decline into empty scholasticism, yes of course we need that, too. Obviously this is going to be a pendulum thing. Too many Morettis will call forth a new Edmund Wilson, making fun of "The Fruits of the MLA," which will not be funny paper titles this time around, but mindlessly headlong factual accretions--graphs, maps and trees of no conceivable interest to anyone, save those so inclined to the ceremonial overproduction of graphs, maps and trees that they miss the forest of hermeneutic/aesthetic interest. (Do people recall that Wilson wrote an MLA-mocking piece in 1968, complaining about the excesses of the MLA? But these alleged excesses

6 

John Holbo

were utterly unlike the alleged excesses we associate with the journalistic genre of MLA mockery in the 1980's and 90's. Things change, while staying the same.) But it seems to me the problem of too many Morettis is yet to arise, and should be dealt with if it does, not preemptively. Because, to repeat, this is one of those pendulum swing things. It seems to me, to repeat, that the oddity of the deep incommunicability of results, within a large academic discipline--the lack of portability of the products across vast fields and subfields--should strike us more than it tends to. If it did, we would welcome projects lke Moretti's more eagerly. An institution should look to its nature, try to find things that it is suited to do (as well as trying to change its nature so as to be capable of things it presently isn't suited to do well, yes of course.) So again: actually existing academic literary studies makes more sense if something like Moretti's project makes sense. The next objection strikes like clockwork: but you can't just demand that literary studies professors start accepting each other's results the way math professors accept each other's proofs. The toothbrush joke suggests an arbitrary fastidiousness. It sounds as if I am saying scholars could just accept each other's results but they won't. But the hermeneutic character of the humanistic enterprise (characterize it how you like) means this is more a case of can't than won't. Well, yes. But as an objection to what I am saying this has traction only if the likes of Moretti are not just quantifiers but monomaniac deniers of the possibility of anything valuable slipping through their nets of number. Which he isn't. The final two sentences of section 1 of the first essay. "A more rational literary history. That's the idea." Not a totally Rational history, goodness no.

Why rationalize history? Well, because we can, would be argument one. And it is Moretti's. Because literary studies is less well off if we can't would be argument 2, which I have made. I feel odd even making it, because it seems so obvious. Is it obvious to you? Postscript Comments to this post were good and useful. There was also sharp disagreement, and it became clear to me what I wrote was doomed to be misunderstood in certain ways. Let me append a few post-thoughts that amount to clarifications of what I meant to say. (I also encourage readers who find this interesting to read all the old comments. But I'm not going to rehash them.) For about a year after I wrote this post it seemed to me literary scholars I bumped into, attended conferences with, or corresponded with, were buzzing about Moretti, quite independently of our little event. He seemed to be enjoying a moment of academic celebrity. Fine by me. But it surprised me how much of the buzz was negative. I was struck, in particular, by one panel discussion I attended (yes, an MLA panel) at which it was more or less agreed by various participants that scholarship and pedagogy of literary history are, at present, mutually ill-suited. (I am providing my own gloss on their agreement, if memory serves. But I'll withhold names, in case memory does not serve. Maybe this is just me talking to myself here.) On the one hand, you need a set of texts that will provide you with sufficient evidence to pronounce intelligently--justifiably--on such subjects as `the nineteenth century American novel'. On the other hand, you need a set of texts to fill out a 12-16 week syllabus for an undergraduate course of that title. There isn't any one set of texts that can do both jobs.

8 

John Holbo

Of course it isn't so surprising that the most sophisticated scholarship goes beyond what can be crammed into a single undergraduate semester. But there is more to the point. There seems to be a tendency for good undergraduate pedagogy to recapitulate bad (as opposed to merely incomplete or preliminary) historiography. The teacher finds herself proceeding as if `the nineteenth century novel' (pick your suitably broad subject) is the sort of thing that is at all likely to show up through the lens of eight novels to be read. The truth is: reading a small number of novels and writing a few interpretive essays can be a fine and enriching way to spend a few months. But it's not the same kind of enriching activity as studying the novel historically, with scholarly rigor. And no one really thinks otherwise. So tension between pedagogy and historiography is not just tension between for-students simplification and for-scholars sophistication. It is tension between value and validity. You are asking people to use one method--close reading--to arrive at answers that require a different method--distant reading (to use Moretti's term.)The value of literature is substantially derived from close reading activity (broadly conceived--you can be more hermeneutic or erotic about these virtues of closeness, as you like.) But many sorts of scholarly claims demand more `distant reading' methods, on pain of invalidity. So how do you proceed, if value and validity tug against each other, rather than going together, as one would have wished? Sitting in the audience at this panel, thinking my own way through all this, I was innocently waiting for someone to point out that Moretti might help. Yet three out of four of the scholars on this panel were very negative about Moretti when his name (inevitably) came up. They were almost (not quite) dismissive. The fourth seemed impressed mostly by the newness of Moretti's project; seemed heartened that there was a

Graphs, Maps, Trees, Fruits

 9

new thing some scholars were enthusiastic about. But surely there is more to be enthusiastic here than enthusiasm itself. Let me put the point yet another way. Rereading the contributions to our event, I am struck by contrasts between respondents who were otherwise in basic agreement. I say Moretti is good because he is imitable. Sean McCann approves of Moretti, but predicts he will be largely un-imitable. Tim Burke writes: "Of all the odd things I've heard in recent years, one of the oddest would be that there are objections in principle to the research paradigm that Franco Moretti describes in Graphs, Maps, Trees." But Jenny Davidson quotes Elif Batuman regarding Moretti's "irresistible magnetism of the diabolical." She says she is "at once seduced and rendered wary" by this distinctive quality, which she associates with the `heresy' of quantification. How is it possible that an author can seem, at once, moderate and agreeable to the point of utter, ecumenical unobjectionablility, yet also `diabolical', `heretical'? If the answer is that literary scholars take the undesirability of quantification for granted, whereas everyone else takes its desirability for granted, the literary folks are flat out of luck. Everyone else is right. But I'm quite sure that's not the whole story. (I hope it's not even a significant part of it.) I think these divergent responses are largely due to divergent ways of taking rather characteristic "grand flourishes" (Davidson's term) Moretti makes on his own behalf. Davidson objects, rather mildly, that Moretti poses as a revolutionary, but seems to be reinventing the wheel. "As a scholar working in the field of eighteenth-century British literature and culture, I find Moretti's work around these questions fruitful but its distinctiveness or originality somewhat overstated. You don't have to be a heroic scientific pioneer and experimentalist to uncover the patterns in long-forgotten British novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries."

10 

John Holbo

Let's consider: `Distinctiveness or originality somewhat overstated.' I would have said: surely highly distinctive even if the conclusions are not so original. Moretti's methods will mostly help by acting as an independent check on what we think we already know. And yet: that's very exciting and new. Davidson continues: "Ruth Perry's recent Novel Relations, for instance, reaps the rewards of a lifetime of reading eighteenth-century fiction to discern patterns (the rise of the novel of the second attachment, the trope of the cri de sang) that are as illuminating as Moretti's graphs about literary and social history." But the concern is obviously going to be that a lifetime spent reading such-and-such a body of material may, after all, reap the reward of a distorted view. (It's not as though we think we know that riding a hobby-horse for years conveys immunity to eccentricity.) Should I trust what Perry has to say or not? If some sort of independent, quantitative confirmation or disconfirmation were possible, that would be extremely welcome. (Confirmation is a more inductively problematic relationship than disconfirmation. Still, if the same result were arrived at by a sensitive critic, reading a body of work, and by a number-cruncher, mining that body of work, that would be confidence-bolstering, if not strictly proof.) At the time of our event, I think I was more or less reading Moretti's grand flourishes as just flourishes. I was enchanted by the humbler possibilities, whereas Davidson was a bit more inclined to take them seriously (the flourishes, that is), hence to regard them as potential hubris. Looking at the text today, I am inclined to split the difference. Partly this is the result of me subsequently coming around to a more skeptical view of many of Moretti's bolder claims. This is very important, but too much to shoehorn in here. Let me conclude these afterthoughts the same way I began this piece: by accentuating the positive, in a small way.

It so happens I have just finished reading Jenny Davidson's new book, Breeding: A Partial History of the Eighteenth Century. It is a good book, I think. I feel I learned from it. But I am quite sure it is exactly the sort of book that could use Morettiesque methods to complement it. There is a tension in Davidson's methodology, and even more so in her characterizations of that methodology. She makes her own problematic gestures of distinctiveness and originality. When we see this, Moretti's humble uses look even more useful. Here is Davidson's characterization of what is going on in her book: "I wanted, medium-like, to make these pages a sort of parliament, an auditorium in which the voices of actors in and commentators on the story of heredity in the eighteenth century can be heard" (7-8). And: "The great value of this kind of swerve away from the straight-and-narrow of the historical method--what makes it worth the risk--seems to me to lie in the counterfactual or path-not-taken traction it offers on ideas" (8). She takes as models W.G. Sebald and Roland Barthes and feels generally confirmed in her faith in, "the writerly approach, an essayistic or discursive mode that prefers not to participate in all of the disciplinary practices of history or criticism proper" (12). Yet, as she writes near the end of the book, "I offer these thoughts in a spirit diametrically opposed to the deliberate amateurism of David Denby's Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World. I want to keep all the intensity and the precision of academic writing, and the virtues of specialization, but to make what I write at least potentially open to readers in other disciplines, or in other walks of life" (198). I think the tension here is fairly obvious: if you are deliberately refusing to fulfill disciplinary expectations; if you are giving up specialization for the serendipitous joys of a swerving, cross-disciplinary jaunt; if you are foregoing a sober, aca-

12 

John Holbo

demic style for a more writerly, novelistic one; then whatever makes you better than David Denby can hardly be the fact that you are a properly disciplined, specialized, academic writer, whereas Denby is not. (I have not read Denby and have no opinion whatsoever about the specific case. I really am interested only in the general methodological question.) And there is another problem here. Davidson's againstthe-disciplinary-grain posture is not fully credible because, frankly, this posture is the disciplinary grain at the present time. This sort of post-Greenblattian-Auerbachian-Sebaldian-Barthesian, New Historicist, or post-New Historicist `touch of the real' essayistic-academic style is, if not predominant, then at least very familiar, very commonly met with. It's normal. On the one hand, this makes perfect sense: people are attracted to this style for all the reasons Davidson says she is. So they write in this style. But, on the other hand, it can't fully make sense for writing against the disciplinary grain to be the disciplinary grain. `Against the grain' feels like automatic, contrarian wisdom; innately in touch with all those confining, facilitating, secure grooves of disciplinarity, specialization, so forth--yet leaping above and beyond all that. Losing touch yet keeping in touch. Inspired yet rigorous. Solidly argued yet boldly leaping. These are the contraries we would like to combine. I feel the impulse myself. It's no mystery why people want this. But how do we seriously propose to get it? Even harder: how do we suppose that squaring the circle, like that, could be the new disciplinary normal. What's the disciplinary formula for indulging in counter-disciplinary irregularities on a regular, disciplinary basis? Moretti is not the guaranteed solution to all such troubles, perhaps not actually the solution to any of them. But it seems to me that what should attract writers like Davidson to Moretti, without detracting from their own projects in

Graphs, Maps, Trees, Fruits

 13

the least, is the prospect of some serious assistance in pulling off these contrary combinations with more conviction. The distinctiveness they achieve hereby may not be so much Moretti's as their own. Let me put it another way: just as the plural of anecdote is not data, the plural of synecdoche is not historicism. The basic concern about the sort of historicism Davidson practices is that it is argument-by-synecdoche; it persuades by virtue of its essayistic charms. We are given a sample of `voices'. Very well. How do we know the sample is valid? (Read again the passage from Moretti that I started out with.) I know what Davidson will reply: it's not so easy to approach such a topic in any more systematic way. There's such a hybrid mass of inherently cross-disciplinary, heterogeneous material to come to grips with. (I haven't said anything about Davidson's specific historical claims. Suffice it to say that a study of 18th Century attitudes towards `breeding' inevitably carries one to many different places.) Fair enough. But that isn't a good reason not to want that other thing, let alone to make strictly misleading gestures to the effect that, ordinarily, we have that other thing. It is closer to being the exception than the rule. Were it possible to buttress Davidson's Breeding with some bank of Moretti-esque maps, graphs and trees, the latter might just repeat the former, thereby amounting to confirmation (of a not-strictly dispositive sort). But they would still allow Davidson herself to claim, with greater credibility, the sort of distinctiveness she, indeed, wants to claim. Her style of stroll across the fields is most credible if it truly is a break from regular, systematic attempts to survey and plow through those fields. We strengthen--and in no way undermine--the value of `essayistic' approaches to literary history by encouraging that other sort of approach.

I. "Graphs, Maps, Trees" by Franco Moretti Moretti sounds like a happy guy. And it's infectious. Why pledge allegiance to a groove and turn it into a rut? Get out of that stuffy coffee shop and into a cool refreshing stats lab. Live a little! (With the aid of twenty grad students.) An OuBelLetriPo is overdue. Let's pick a quantitative approach and a subject out of the hat: "Pie charts" and "Coming-out stories"--wait, um, I wasn't ready; can I try again? "Income distribution" and "Aphra Behn"? Perfect! Will you end up with a demolished bit of received wisdom? A sociological footnote? Or just graphic representation of a critical triteness? You don't know! You think Perec knew the plot of La Disparition before he started? From this set of ongoing experiments, "Graphs" seem to be going best. Those cross-cultural Rise-of-the-Novel curves hold immediate appeal. And what they appeal for is correlation with something else. Moretti plausibly and skeptically explains who might've stepped on the brakes when the curve dips, but who revs the engine? Do accelerators vary as inhibitors do? Even more intriguing is Moretti's report that nineteenthcentury English fiction genres tended to turn over in a clump every twenty-five or thirty years, rather than smoothly year

by year. But his report relies exclusively on secondary sources, and risks echo chamber artifacts. Are generational timespans a convenience for the researchers he draws from? What if dialogic genres ("Jacobin novel" and "Anti-Jacobin novel") weren't shown separately? How closely do the novel's clumps lock step with transitions in other forms? How far can we reliably carry statistical analysis of a non-random sample of forty-four? Plenty of intrigue, then, and plenty of opportunity to remake the mistakes of others who've tried to turn history into a "real science." Since maps are often referred to by writers (and, when otherwise unavailable, as in fantasy genres, often passed along to the reader), their re-use by critics tends to be confirmatory rather than revelatory--most dramatically when Clive Hart walked each character's path through the "Wandering Rocks" (Hart & Hayman, 181-216). In "Maps," Moretti's diagrams make a good case for a not very startling thesis: a nostalgic series of "village stories" will most likely feature a village from which meanderings are launched but which fades into insignificance over time. As he admits, his scatter plot of Parisian protagonists provides even less novelty: if you have an ambitious young French hero, you start him in the Latin Quarter and aim him elsewhere. (In "The Invention of the Artist's Life," Pierre Bourdieu diagrammed The Sentimental Education's character trajectories on a Parisian map and similarly found graphic confirmation of what was never really in doubt.) Judging by early fruit, "Trees" hold the least promise. As presented, the "free indirect discourse" evolutionary tree doesn't meet Moretti's own standards of rigor, since he offers no material justification for either his selection of source material or his linkages.

Graphs, Maps, Trees

His other evolutionary trees may be most interesting for failing to justify their initiating assumption: that visible decipherable clues define the classic mystery genre. Extending the branches to verifiable examples of "fair play" might draw the tree-builder into unabstractable tangles. In the classic blend of detection with gothic and horror elements, consider how often the resolution seems arbitrary, delivered with a wink. Given how poorly most human beings follow a logical argument, does anything more than lip service have to be paid to rationality? To what extent was that expectation set by reviewers rather than noticed by readers? How quickly after the rule's formulation was it challenged by re-assertion of other aspects of crime melodrama in spy stories, thrillers, procedurals, and hard-boiled stories, and then how quickly was it undermined by "cross-breeding"? (My own experience of genre change seems closer to Alfred Kroeber's self-grafting Tree of Human Culture than to species divergence. You only go so hardcore before background singers return to the mix.) More exhaustive and more focused, Moretti's "everything published in the Strand" tree carries more conviction (and much less tidiness) than his initial "Conan Doyle and his rivals" tree. Exhaustively constrained to such an extent, though, the tree may describe something less than Moretti seems to hope for. I can imagine a tree tracing certain ingredients of virtual reality stories in 1980s science fiction. But would that graph evolution or just Gardner Dozois's editorial obligation to avoid strict repetition? Moretti closes his trilogy with two general remarks. One is a call for materialism, eclecticism, and description. This I applaud, since the most interesting scholarship I've read lately includes interdisciplinary studies of "accidentals," histories of readership and publishing, text-crunching of non-canonical sets, whether mechanically or passionately. There's plenty of life even in purely literary anti-interpretive

18 

Ray Davis

experiments such as those collected in Ben Friedlander's Simulcast. The other "constant" Moretti claims is "a total indifference to the philosophizing that goes by the name of `Theory' in literature departments." (He doesn't define "Theory" more precisely, but Novalis is apparently not on the prohibited list.) And here, I think, I'll keep my hands quietly folded. I agree that twentieth century philosophers and psychologists have made awful interpretation factories, and that literary studies sometimes reek of old shit under new labels. But interpretations generated from political science, economics, quantum physics, or fMRI averaging tend to be just as inane. What makes such readings tedious isn't which foreign discipline has been used to slap together a mold, but the inherent moldiness of the affair. For a critic and pleasure reader like myself, Moretti's texttwice-removed findings fit best in the foundations and framework of aesthetics, clearing false assumptions and blocking overly confident assertions. That's also where neurobiology, developmental and social psychology, and other cognitive sciences seem most useful. Along with philosophy. Having agreed to open up the field, why ban one of the original players? This isn't the sort of game that's improved by team spirit. II. "Sets Hamper Grasp" by A Contrite Form

"Eidetic imagery--the ability to retain in detail a pictorial configuration--is found in approximately 8% of the school population, but almost never in adults, aside from artists."

In "Senses, Symbols, Operations" (in Perkins), H. Gardner compared performances of a group of eleven-year-olds and a group of fourteen-year-olds across a wide variety of perceptual, motor, and cognitive tasks. For the most part, there was no improvement with age, or there was a slight decline. Improved: solving brain-teasers; recall of important narrative details. Significantly worse: memory of irrelevant details; dot-counting.
"... we must ask whether a cultural emphasis on operative thinking has had, as an unintended consequence, a deleterious effect upon figurative capacities .... the decline of incidental learning, the waning of interest in the arts which is so characteristic of adolescence, and contrasting strategies of adolescents and preadolescents in the style discrimination tasks [adolescents tending to compare, preadolescents tending to describe] at least hint at the possibility ..."

I have also lost my taste for pictures and music .... My mind seems to have

Afterthoughts I didn't much like Moretti's book or my review. Disappointment makes a dull muse; I tried to lend interest by borrowing Moretti's bluff tone. The result was incoherent: flashy threads on a sketchy character. As punishment, I was condemned to explain my reaction all over again in comments. First I unpacked the reference to "echo chamber artifacts":
... there's a post-facto academically-inclined and then selectively filtered definition of "genre" being built on: it has to be noticeable to late twentieth-century Anglo-American literature majors; it can't be too short; it can't be too long; then there are the outliers, like McGann starting modernism with William Morris or Aldiss starting science fiction with Mary Shelley .... When I've seen people try to delimit living "genres," it's been a fiasco, and I'm not sure distance clarifies vision. We're not talking chromosome comparisons, or inability to reproduce. Tertiary English department results might be like restricting a medical research survey to studies financed by pharmaceutical companies.

Bill Benzon then pressed me on the perennial topic of cultural evolution.

Graphs, Maps, Trees

 21

Some credos: 1. The human species evolved. 2. As a species, humans are inseparably dependent on other humans in ways that go beyond simple reproduction. We call this dependency "culture." (Note, though, that I haven't personified biological change over time by saying something like "Evolution's goal was culture.") 3. Human beings are attracted to novelty-within-limits. The attraction is evidenced both culturally and by studies of individual behavior (insofar as "individual behavior" can be said to exist in a cultural species). 4. The definition of "attractively limited novelty" differs over time, and from individual to individual, and between cultural contexts.

So the desire of the editor to avoid strict repetition combines biology (and thus, to some unknowable extent, an "evolution" which might be figuratively treated as a motive force), biography, and culture (including a corporate capitalist economy). And, should the editor be successful, that desire could be said to (temporarily) reinforce the cultural expectations that the editor caters to. What's gained by calling that evolution? Where's the oomph of the metaphor? It may be difficult for biologists to clearly define the limits of "species," but that doesn't begin to compare with the difficulty of defining "sub-genre" or "trend" or "fashion" in a way that can support extended analysis. To say that Dozois' individual choices were an evolutionary force presumes what hasn't yet been proven: that there is "a thing" that evolved from "a different thing" by divergence.

22 

Ray Davis

Insofar as a final "thing" could be said to have come out of the virtual reality fad I can only picture it as a set of nowshared assumptions which no longer have to be justified and which are no longer capable of producing a frisson (except among newbies; e.g., academics who'd read no sf and seen no HK movies before The Matrix came out.) But such a set would be an example of convergence--a knob in Kroeber's weirdly self-absorbing cultural tree rather than a leaf on Darwin's biological tree. Even if we jump exclusively to that level of abstraction-- sub-genre rather than story--I don't believe we find strict divergence. One of the appeals of VR was its obvious affinity to other meta-narrative techniques/sub-genres; it bolstered itself from the start with borrowings from mystic visions, fairy tales, theater stories, highbrow fourth-wall breaking, and so forth. It could be said to have diverged from some other sf fads of the time, but only by its freedom to re-absorb what had been (temporarily) excluded. Rather than taking on (and glorying in) all the baggage of "evolution," I'm more inclined to Timothy Burke`s imagery of emergence: "dumb luck." I think that's more accurate, less misleading, and--sadly for professional scholars and critics--also much less likely to grab the journalistic imagination.
... Given a science fiction scenario in which hybridization was by far the most visible method by which genetic material passed, in which hybridization could happen across almost any examples of any biological species, and in which there was near complete turnover of species every twenty-five to thirty years, do you think that the category of biological species would have developed in any way recognizable to us? Would that world's D4rw1n have explained the origin of species in the same way?

Graphs, Maps, Trees

 23

Again, when it comes to literary fashions, marketing, and influence, what (besides confusion) is added by the evolutionary metaphor?

Following Moretti's response, I became increasingly irascible:
All criticism is doomed to analyze only its own perceptions. What the critic is finally saying is, this is my fantasy when faced with the work. What is essential for the interpreter is an ethics of modesty: that he not consider his own perception is the only one.  ­"Edgar Allen Poe" (Friedlander, quoting Rodefer, quoting Kristeva) Less tentatively than John Emerson, I'm a pluralist. (As a consumer, anyway; as a producer, I'm merely an amateur belletrist.) I enjoy much of the presentday interdisciplinary work which might be classified as "materialist" or "quantitative." And I understand that everyone who works in the humanities considers themselves a member of a beleaguered minority, no matter how successful they might seem to the outside world. But as a pluralist, like John, I feel some need to push back against an either/or tone. The illusion of rising above one's own time is thrilling, whether the buoyant gas be eternal verities, the universal language of music, or scientific analysis. But history sinks us all eventually, and, despite the earnest (and often well-rewarded) effort put into social and psychiatric sciences, they have a short shelf life. If not many people read Poe's or Twain's or James's criticism nowadays, even fewer build on studies of racial traits and phrenology and hysteria. To paraphrase Prof. Arthur Lee, the social science of today will be the symptom of tomorrow.

24

"I may as well admit right away that every time I have studied competition, success, and failure, I have never found that luck played a major role ..." That's hardly surprising, since we're not working in controlled laboratory conditions. Explanations can be invented for any event. The problem is proving them. (Disproving proposed explanations, on the hand, is often both doable and worthwhile.) Histories which preclude dumb luck and the strictly unpredictable influence of individuals tend towards the Whiggish or Spenglerian. The excluded arbitrary returns in the form of the historian's decisions. "And then again, it may well be that the study of literature will always require, or be enriched by, both close reading and abstraction, interpretations and explanations; but this will amount to saying that literature requires two conceptually opposite approaches. Which is odd, and will make for some interesting speculation on why it should be so." As Laura Carroll indicates, "interpretation" is hard to shake free of. For example, Adam Roberts's pre-1900 "science fiction" wouldn't have been analyzable as such until "mainstream realism" became wellenough established to make those isolated works seem like part of a rival tradition. Even choosing what elements to trace through which representatives of a "genre" is an interpretive act, which is why I called the Strand spectrum analysis more convincing than the "Conan Doyle's rivals" tree. Insofar as literature can be said to exist at all, yes, I believe it calls forth both "interpretation" and "explanation"--that is, a desire to narrate the work's intended meaning and a desire to narrate the work's origins. (Already that seems not so binary a opposition.) Or it calls forth a desire to describe the work itself, or to describe our reaction to the work, or, more generally,

Graphs, Maps, Trees

 25

to respond. Trying to pursue all of these approaches at once would, I agree, result in an unholy mess and a shattered career. But that doesn't mean that they're unambiguously opposed. Let's return to the celebrated clue of the drugged coffee. I haven't read the source story, and so I don't know what its effect in context would be for me, much less for a reader of the time. But I've seen the Continental Op and Philip Marlowe walk more or less knowingly into traps to "shake things up." The detective mystery, broadly defined, shows someone gathering knowledge about criminal circumstances and bringing about an expository conclusion. Presumably drawing from the nearly autistic Holmes, the polite puzzle mystery depicts detached knowledge (represented by the handling of clues, maps, and timetables) and emotional disengagement from the (emotionally arbitrary) conclusion. Hard-boiled mysteries and psychological thrillers, on the other hand, show knowledge as physical experience and insist that observation is inseparable from influence. One might, Moretti-like, try tracing the split by tracking the amount of physical and emotional damage sustained by the detective--beatings in one column, druggings in another--but there would eventually be convergences: Hammett's "drawing room" mystery (set among the detective's dysfunctional friends, with the detective shielded by almost pathological smugness and with a viciously undercut solution); the "Ellery Queen" team's late decision to make Queen a fallible bringer of injustice; Sayers's turn from Wimsey toward Harriet Vane ... There's not necessarily a conflict between intellectual-emotional engagement and the deployment of evidence. Much of the quantitative, historical, comparative, and materialist research that's been

26

mentioned results in richer or refreshed readings. In that list, I'd include what I've read of Moretti's previous work; on early acquaintance, he sounds like a Marxist Hugh Kenner: a congenial combination. For whatever conscious or unconscious reasons, he seems to have evolved in the direction of Philo Vance, insisting on the need to keep the reading experience (whether current-day or historical) at arm's length. Me, I'm a Black Mask fan. Literature, like murder, is no place for clean hands.

The reception of Graphs, Maps, Trees seemed to repeat a familiar irony: confidently self-proclaimed scientific objectivity met by hero-worship, declarations of allegiance, and inattention to the evidence. By the end of the Valve event, I felt like the hapless (and dickless) EPA inspector of Ghostbusters, pointing out the right things in the wrong movie.
As Bob O'Hara summarized in passing, contingent history cannot be made isomorphic with verifiable lab science. Some of this recent rhetoric seems intent on remaking the mistakes of such historical system-builders as Brooks Adams and Oswald Spengler. While scientised literary history will likely contribute to fewer deaths than scientised general history did, it seems even more confused: the aesthetic realm is defined by particularity, atemporality, and variation of taste. Regarding "rigor": If someone vigorously misapplies techniques to rigidly-held arbitrary premises, are the results "rigorous"? They appear so; they even feel so. Still, there's no reason to believe they're true. An unconsciously developing preference for visible decodable clues "sounds reasonable." But Moretti's clue tree doesn't prove it: the tree never reaches the supposed end goal of evolution; chronological

ordering by height is implied but not documented; no evidence is shown that Doyle's rivals at each "level of development" were as popular as Doyle's stories at the same level. The parsimony principle suggests instead that the popularity of the "Sherlock Holmes stories" was due to Sherlock Holmes, with visible clues a side-effect of building narratives around such a character: the magician is more effective when audience members inspect the box. What defines a MOR-generic detective novel isn't the quality of its puzzle but the presence of a trademark detective. But then we're back to personal names, which aren't nearly as scientistic as abstractions. Sullen bastard that I am, I'm not even cheered up by Steven Berlin Johnson's call for equally "rigorous" use of brain studies. We've heard what professional philosophers think of the English department's use of philosophy, what mathematicians think of English department Gödel and chaos, and what physicists think of English department entropy and quantum theory. And we've heard some of what professional biologists and cognitive scientists think of "Evolutionary Psychology." Popularized metaphorically applied science is not science. But it is what consumers want, and it's lucrative. Since 1993, I've been fascinated by application of the cognitive sciences to aesthetics. Since 1995 or so, people who find this out have asked me what I thought of some best-selling book or newspaper article. And I've always had to say that I prefer reading in the primary disciplines. Outside them, we seem to get Just So stories which justify a conservative canon, New Age vapidity, or pop culture tautology. ("People really do enjoy what they seem to enjoy. EEGs prove it!") Working scientists who venture into criticism fare little better. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran's

defense of this Chola bronze2 sounds like a Jungian art appreciation class. If he's describing biologically determined reactions, why does his audience have to be won over? I'd say it's because aesthetics is too complex and socially-personally contingent to support the sort of argument he's making. Unless we burn art, it outlives our theories about art. I believe the cognitive sciences, cross-cultural history, and philosophy can all shed light on why that is. But where's the percentage? What sells is a familiar story with a twist. 100 newspapers and NPR can't be wrong.

Occasionally over the next few months I attempted to draw attention to related research, most pointedly in this post from March 4, 2006:
[...] Even in historic genres, it's possible to make a conscious effort to switch imaginative contexts. [...] Along those lines, I liked [Kinds of Literature by Alastair Fowler] more than I expected. Genre markers are (sometimes unintended) signals to a community. Spotting the markers isn't enough to tell us what they're doing there. Fowler seemed to get that. A more recent good example is Richard A. McCabe's "Annotating Anonymity" in Ma®king the Text [ed. Joe Bray, Anne Henry, and Miriam Fraser]. Rather than just describing the archaisms and explanatory apparatus of The Shepheardes Calendar as pastoral conventions, McCabe shows how they took advantage of (and sometimes had to work against) the specific model of Servius's Virgil commentaries. I'm now finishing Memory in Oral Traditions by David C. Rubin. [...] Rubin explains certain generic conventions of epic, ballad, and counting-out rhymes as directly molded by the mechanisms of

multi-generational verbal transmission, and backs it up with evidence. On a more negative note, Franco Moretti's "Graphs" and "Trees" are strictly parasitic on texts which he keeps strictly at arm's length. Not what I'd call a healthy relationship. More successful interdisciplinary materialist approaches go beyond the confines of the English department. And although the nora project [see Matt Kirschenbaum's contribution] limits itself to textual analysis, it's with the reasonable aim of noticing textual aspects missed by received opinion. Books don't compete with each other in a closed bibliosphere. Popularity and genre are social, not strictly textual. They can only be understood by looking outside a text itself. And when you do so, I think you find something more like chaos theory than like biological evolution.

Eventually, though, I think I got the message. Graphs, Maps, Trees wasn't a collection of research papers. It was a celebration, a manifesto whose solipsism gave it the appeal of a human interest story. Any questioning of its results would inevitably be taken as dissent from its cause. In more ways than one, my lack of enthusiasm was genre-based.

 Poetry, Patterns, and Provocation: The nora Project
matthew kirschenbaum
[editor's note ­ Kirschenbaum's piece describes the nora project which has, subsequently, become part of the MONK project. Kirschenbaum's piece is especially interesting for its methodological reflections. Links have been updated.] What follows is a brief introduction to nora [now MONK], an ongoing and experimental project in literature and computation. My thanks to The Valve for the opportunity to make our work part of the conversation here. While not directly inspired by Moretti's writing in Graphs, Maps, Trees, nora exhibits many of the same priorities: an emphasis on quantitative method, large-scale data analysis, visualization, abstract modeling, cooperation and collaboration. These are methods foreign to many in the humanities, as are our actual technologies which run the gamut from XML and Java to a toolkit developed by the Automated Learning Group at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Yet nora (which, depending on who you ask on the project team, originated as either an acronym for no one remembers acronyms or a character in the William Gibson novel Pattern Recognition--though we've since located other noras) is also about provocation, ambiguity, and ultimately, interpretation--in short, still the stuff most of us would identify as central to academic literary studies. First, here's the official version of what we're doing:

 31

32 

Matthew Kirschenbaum

The goal of the nora project is to produce software for discovering, visualizing, and exploring significant patterns across large collections of full-text humanities resources in existing digital libraries. In search-and-retrieval, we bring specific queries to collections of text and get back (more or less useful) answers to those queries; by contrast, the goal of data-mining (including text-mining) is to produce new knowledge by exposing unanticipated similarities or differences, clustering or dispersal, co-occurrence and trends. Over the last decade, many millions of dollars have been invested in creating digital library collections: at this point, terabytes of full-text humanities resources are publicly available on the web. Those collections, dispersed across many different institutions, are large enough and rich enough to provide an excellent opportunity for text-mining, and we believe that web-based text-mining tools will make those collections significantly more useful, more informative, and more rewarding for research and teaching. nora is currently in the second year of two years of funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The Principal Investigator is John Unsworth, formerly director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, now Dean of the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. Participating researchers are also based at the Universities of Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, and Alberta. Now for the unofficial version: All of this is very, very hard. For starters, none of the technical architecture for what we wanted to do was in place when we started. We were able to leverage several existing platforms and technologies but other pieces had to be built from scratch. At present, nora is held together with chewing gum and duct tape, a loose tissue of resources and standards (datastores, text mining engine, visualization toolkit and

Poetry, Patterns, and Provocation

 33

end-user interface) coupled with the more-than-occasional late night email or IM session when something isn't working. A significant part of our efforts to date have been devoted to stabilizing this architecture, and we're most of the way there at this point. But we've also been spending our time trying to figure out what technologies like text mining are good for in humanities research, particularly literary studies. Were we in a social sciences discipline that routinely contends with large amounts of data or even perhaps a humanities discipline like history we would not have to work quite so hard. Literary scholars, however--here the force of Moretti's arguments make themselves felt--traditionally do not contend with very large amounts of data in their research. A significant component of our work is therefore basic research in the most literal sense: what kinds of questions do we seek to answer in literary studies and how can data mining help, or-- more interestingly--what new kinds of questions can data mining provoke? (As a sidebar, we tried to answer that first one inductively. We compiled a list of verbs occurring in critical essays on 18th- and 19th-century British and American literature from journals in Project Muse that never or rarely occur in the American National Corpus, which is newspaper writing for the most part. In short, a portrait of a profession.) But the barriers to entry are non-trivial. To engage in data mining on its own turf demands fluency in terms like naïve Bayesian analysis, cosine similarity matrices, features, vectors, dendograms, decision trees, and neural networks. On the one hand we don't want to black box this stuff. We also don't want to build a system so intimidating that one needs an advanced degree in information science just to approach it. Data mining and visualization are traditionally perceived as problem solving technologies. The canonical instance is Don Swanson's early use of text mining in bio-medical lit-

34 

Matthew Kirschenbaum

erature to identify a possible link between magnesium deficiency and migraine headaches. Swanson founds patterns of association in widely disparate areas of the published literature to make the initial connection, subsequently confirmed through a great deal of more traditional medical testing. He called his findings "undiscovered public knowledge"--it was all there, already in the journals, but no one had put the pieces together because no human reader would likely ever have been in a position to synthesize all of the relevant articles. But we don't typically set out to "solve" problems in the humanities. We're not trying to find the causes of migraines. We're not trying to "solve" the problem of Emily Dickinson so that we can move on to the even more urgent problem of Walt Whitman. So what does data mining have to offer literary interpretation? To start, we're interested in provocation, anomaly, and outlier results as much or more than in what we think the system actually gets right. In one early proof of concept for nora, Steve Ramsay and Bei Yu attempted to classify Shakespeare's plays according to the traditional categories. The data mining got most of them right. That's not what was interesting though, at least not to Steve. What was interesting was that the data mining thought Othello might be a comedy. Interesting not because we're assigning any undue authority to the machine's determinations, but because the question became what was it about Othello that made it different from the other tragedies? Why did this dumb brute force machine "read" it as a comedy? As it happens, Steve subsequently stumbled across a strain of scholarship on the play that makes exactly that argument. This initial experiment lead us down a path that produced the following kinds of questions, as recently articulated by John Unsworth: What patterns would be of interest to literary scholars? Can we distinguish between patterns that are,

Poetry, Patterns, and Provocation

 35

for example, characteristic of the English language, and those that are characteristic of a particular author, work, topic, or time? Can we extract patterns that are based in things like plot, or syntax? Or can we just find patterns of words? When is a correlation meaningful, and when is it coincidental? What does it mean to be "coincidental"? How do we train software to focus on the features that are of interest to researchers, and can that training interface be usable for people who don't like numbers and do like to read? Can we structure an interface that is sufficiently generalized that it can accommodate interest in many different kinds of features, without knowing in advance what they will be? What are meaningful visualizations, and how do we allow them to instruct their users on their use, while provoking an appropriate suspicion of what they appear to convey? How would we evaluate the effectiveness of our visualizations, or the software in general? Is it succeeding if it surprises us with its results, or if it doesn't? How can we make visualizations function as interfaces, in an iterative process that allows the user to explore and tinker? And how in the hell can we do all this in real time on the web, when a modest subset of our collection, like the novels of a single author, contain millions of datapoints, all of which need to be sifted for these patterns? Our team at Maryland includes my colleague Martha Nell Smith in the English department, a long-time Emily Dickinson scholar. In order to focus our efforts I urged Martha and the rest of the team here to focus on the question of erotic language in Dickinson, certainly a well-turned question in the scholarship. We began with a corpus of about 200 XML-encoded letters comprising correspondence between the poet Emily Dickinson and Susan Huntington (Gilbert) Dickinson, her sister-in-law (married to her brother William Austin). The demo we produced requires a user to first rank an initial set of documents with which to train the automatic

36 

Matthew Kirschenbaum

classifier. This is done on a scale of 1 to 5, a process we call hot or not for short. The process is not unlike the NetFlix interface that asks you to evaluate your favorite movies and then finds others that the recommender system thinks also might be to your liking. This initial training set is then delivered to the data mining engine, which proceeds to iterate over the rest of the document set and return its initial predictions. Users can see which individual words the data mining seized upon as potential indicators of the erotic. The method here, by the way, is known as naïve bayes. Bayesian probability is the domain of probability that deals with non-quantifiable events: not whether a coin will land heads or tails for instance, but rather the percentage of people who believe the coin might land on its side; also known as subjective probability. Our Bayesian classification is "naïve" because it deliberately does not consider relationships and dependencies between words we might instinctively think go together--"kiss" and "lips," for example. The algorithm merely establishes the presence or absence of one or more words, and takes their presence or absence into account when assigning a probability value to the overall text. ("Yeah, naïve, you, got that part right," I hear some of you saying. But this is the kind of thing computers are very good at, and naïve Bayes has been proven surprisingly reliable in a number of different text classification domains.) Right now the demo is hard-coded to the Dickinson corpus, but it will be general before we are through with nora. As I hope should be clear, by far the least interesting aspect of this (to us) would be the machine's definitive conclusion as to whether Emily is hot or not (we think the answer to that is rather obvious). No, we're interested in the data mining's capacity for provocation. Here, for example, is Smith on some early results, when the word "mine" ranked high on the list of words the data mining thought might be hot:

Poetry, Patterns, and Provocation

 37

The minute I saw it, I had one of those "I knew that" moments. Besides possessiveness, "mine" connotes delving deep, plumbing, penetrating--all things we associate with the erotic at one point or another. And Emily Dickinson was, by her own accounting and metaphor, a diver who relished going for the pearls. So "mine" should have been identified as a "likely hot" word, but has not been, oddly enough, in the extensive literature on Dickinson's desires. Same goes for "write"--oh to leave a piece of oneself with, for, the beloved. To "write" is to present oneself, or a piece of oneself, physically--and noting that the data mining was picking up both "write" when recorded by Dickinson and "write" in the [XML] header [where it would indicate a letter] led the three of us to a "can we teach a computer to recognize tone" discussion. I wonder, remembering Dickinson's "A pen has so many inflections and a voice but one" what the human machine can do, what the human machine does (recognizing, identifying tone) what we think we're doing when we're so damned sure of ourselves. So the data mining has made me plumb much more deeply into little four- and five-letter words, the function of which I thought I was already sure, and has also enabled me to expand and deepen some critical connections I've been making for the last 20 years.

We're currently in the midst of a second, larger experiment on reading sentimental novels from the Early American Fiction Collection at the University of Virginia. The steps we're following run something like this: Stage 1. Evaluate the use of text-mining on a small set of "core" sentimental novels. We will label a subset of the chapters (the training set) with a score indicating a level of sentimentalism, and then see how text mining classifies the remaining chapters from those novels. (Texts: Charlotte, Uncle Tom's Cabin, Incidents in the

38 

Matthew Kirschenbaum

Life of a Slave Girl.) Stage 2. Two more novels will be added to the set to evaluate how well the processes work when more texts by the same authors are added to the set of works studied. (Texts added: Charlotte's Daughter, The Minister's Wooing.) Stage 3. The texts added will be those that scholars recognize as exhibiting sentimentalism, though some may not be as consistently sentimental chapter-by-chapter as the "core" set used earlier. In this experiment there will be more focus on gaining insights on sentimentalism and these novels than in previous experiments. (Some likely texts: Clotelle, The Lamplighter, The Coquette, Hobomok.) Stage 4. Using a textmining model that was developed to identify chapters with strong sentimentalism, use text-mining on a set of works that are considered by scholars not to be wholly sentimental or just not sentimental at all. This may identify parts of texts that contain aspects of sentimentalism, or common word-use that is sentimental in one novel but not another. In this experiment there will be a strong focus will be on gaining insights on sentimentalism and these novels. Texts: Moby-Dick, The Scarlet Letter, The Blithedale Romance, Irving's Sketchbook, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.) There's more to say, including what students might get out of a process like this. Maybe I can address some of that in the comments. But just one more point here: Louis Menand, in the current issue of Profession, decries what he calls the "Captain Kangaroo" model of interdisciplinarity that pervades the humanities: putting a psychologist on the podium with a Freudian literary critic for a conference session, for example. When the full nora project team meets, we have literary scholars, computer scientists, and information specialists around the table. I have a Ph.D. in English, but at Maryland, in addition to Martha Nell Smith and Tanya Clement in the English department I work with Catherine Plaisant and James Rose in the Human Computer

Poetry, Patterns, and Provocation

 39

Interaction Lab and Greg Lord at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). Steve Ramsay at the University of Georgia is a gifted programmer as well as an Assistant Professor of English and his graduate student Sara Steger is both a serious scholar of the 19th century novel and a serious hacker. Similar teams exist at Virginia and Alberta. At Illinois, we're joined by personnel from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (usually ranked as the finest library school in the country) and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). This collaboration is not always easy or idyllic. As Stanley Fish is said to have said somewhere, being interdisciplinary is hard. But the collaboration and mutual respect are real, and they are indispensable to getting things done. No one person has all of the expertise and knowledge at hand that a project like nora demands. I dare say that the graduate students working with us on the project, both from English and computer/information science, are exposed to a very different model of scholarly production, and different work habits, from what would typically be the case in their disciplines. Okay, this really is the last thing I want to say: none of us see this as a messianic enterprise. We're not out to "save" the humanities. Graphs, maps, and trees may not be for everyone, nor is data mining I'm sure. But by the same token, none of what I have been describing here is extracurricular research for me or any of the other humanities scholars on the project team. It counts toward the research portion of my annual distribution of effort for one thing, and the publications and results go onto my vita. Moreover, I'm a member of the MLA (dues all paid up) and work from nora has already been presented there, to interested and receptive audiences. Let's all be a little careful with the generalizations and assumptions that have been flying around some of the previous entries. Cheers again to The Valve for getting this book event together.

 Book Notes: Franco Moretti's Graphs, Maps, and Trees
Timothy Burke
Of all the odd things I've heard in recent years, one of the oddest would be that there are objections in principle to the research paradigm that Franco Moretti describes in Graphs, Maps, Trees. It really doesn't matter what your interest in cultural or literary analysis is: what Moretti proposes is useful grist for your mill. There is no requirement to purchase the entire methodological inventory he makes available, or to throw overboard close reading or aesthetic appreciation or focus on a small and rarefied set of texts. Frankly, when academics propose that we only do what they're doing and stop doing everything else, I tend to ignore such propositions in the same way that I ignore commercial hyperbole while deciding what things I want to buy. I enjoy my iPod: I'm not required to think that it has changed my life or should lead me to chuck my stereo out the window. Whatever you think literary analysis and cultural history are, quantifying the subject of their domains is a very good thing. Indeed, it is a kind of knowledge long inferred and rarely acquired, and though its acquisition unsettles some assumptions made in the inferred known, it equally clarifies and strengthens many other claims--or least puts new and productive burdens on them.
 41

42 

Tim Burke

Leave aside for the moment the particular kinds of modelings and configurations of his data that Moretti describes, and just stick with the numbers alone. Even in a single national literature, it used to be hard to make any clear statements about the total number of books published in a given year or across a long series of years, and of those books, what proportion were works commonly known, analyzed, or regarded as defining a "literature." Now Moretti is not really so unusual or isolated as he might appear in taking an interest in such quantification, as Matt Greenfield has noted. There are many subfields of cultural history and literary analysis that have taken an interest in similar quantification and mapping, in fact, the study of genres has long been shaped by an interest in cycles of publication of the kind Moretti describes. The numbers alone, as Moretti observes, immediately falsify or complicate a series of conventional ways of understanding cultural or literary change over time. When we speak of a particular novel's influence, or about how literature changed in response to a particular work, we're making claims that ought to involve a total topography of published cultural work. Until recently, that would not have been the case. If it turns out that that the lineal descendants of a novel regarded as influential are no more than half a percent of all work published over a ten-year period, this puts pressure on what we mean by "influential." It is not that we are now forbidden to make the claim, but it constrains and specifies what we can potentially mean by such a claim. It's just that Moretti does helps us to realize that often, in making such claims, we've put too much trust in the representations and attributions of authors and readers, which are just as produced and fantastical as any publicly uttered memories, just as Goffmanesque in their performance as any other presentation of self. It is not that we are forbidden either to speak of that novel's quality or desirability, of what we (and past readers) might have

Book Notes

 43

found enticing, inspiring, productive, mysterious in such a work. Moretti doesn't quantify the production of meaning, and even if he wanted to, he could not. Enough on the simple virtues of Moretti's project. Of course cultural historians and literary critics need numbers, all of us, and godspeed to the counting and graphing. I'd love to see someone do something similar with major historical archives: count all the documents, all of them, and graph for me their types and forms. Historians live in their archives, but we don't really know them half as well as we ought to. We accept the categories that the archive offers us, and read along the pathways laid down. In researching consumerism and material culture in colonial Zimbabwe, I had to read horizontally across an archive for a topic that the archive itself did not recognize as lying within its confines, and the sense I got of what the archive contained was complicated considerably, relative to what I'd been expecting. Quantification could only help that understanding further. What could enhance Moretti's work further? What do I see as genuine problems and gaps in the models he offers? First, a warning: that counting publications only scratches the surface of the totality of cultural production in any given post-Gutenberg moment. This is an issue that Raphael Samuel wrote about for years with regard to historians and their archives: that what lands in archives, is recorded as documentary evidence, is just a small and sometimes highly unrepresentative selection of the totality of potential grist for the historian's mill in a given era. Moretti may be counting formal publication and finding that what is commonly taken to represent "national literature" is not typical or representative, but beyond that lies an even larger domain composed of the ephemeral, the unpreserved, the unrecorded. In the age of electronic communication, we should be especially sensitive to this problem. Even with the Web being archived, much of

44 

Tim Burke

what has been written within it, and read avidly, is likely to be lost in the longer-term: asynchronous discussions, epistolary literatures passing through email, and so on. There will come a point at which a project of quantifying cultural production in any given historical moment will only be able to gesture at a vast Oort cloud of unknown writings, performances, and texts, seeing the gravitational effects of some unseeable and lost Planet X tugging at the knowable and quantified. This especially strikes me as an Africanist: we now have some lovely examples of "market literature" in Nigeria available in published form, but beyond those examples, I very much doubt we will ever be able to represent the numbers or varieties of such texts published. If we confine our understanding of what was typical or normal within a cultural form to what we can find in archives, in libraries, in catalogs, in records of publication, we'll ultimately have a deformed conception of the totality. Beyond everything counted there is always another mountain of the uncountable. Historians of slavery turned over every stone and record to count the total numbers of Africans taken across the Atlantic, and even then, had to make some educated guesses, which still fuels (sometimes quite intense) debate among specialists in that field. But once some numbers were in hand, those historians realized that making any statements about their meaning depended on another set of numbers, namely, how many people there were in West and Equatorial Africa at any given moment in any given society, what the fertility rates were in those places, the numbers of men and women, and so on. All numbers which, frankly, are never going to be tallied through anything besides serious guesswork. The second thing that occurs to me on reading Moretti is that we know quantifying publication and quantifying discrete elements (tropes, places, and so on) within publications doesn't tell us half so much as we might think about

Book Notes

 45

the quantification of readership and circulation. Again, maybe it's because I'm an Africanist that I'm especially wary in this regard. You can count up the numbers of newspapers published in a decade in southern Africa, including ones presumptively aimed at African audiences. You would be making a big mistake to assume that such numbers tell you how many people were reading or consuming those newspapers. We know from historical and ethnographic work that the literate often read or reinterpreted newspapers for the illiterate, and that a single copy of a publication was often passed around many readers. Texts travel through readerships in ways that numbers do not describe very well. Here I'd look to Elizabeth Hofmeyr's fantastic book on the transnational history of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress for some insight, for a tracing of how a single work can traverse readerships in ways not precisely correlated with its appearance in libraries, archives, or even within texts that invoke, allude or cite Bunyan. There ought to be a sociology and social history of audience and reading that might complement Moretti's work, but my intuitive suspicion is that it would also very much complicate the claims he would like to make. I also think that the sociology of authorship and publication would be a useful complement to Moretti: to know who knows whom, who reads whom, and to which outlets and forms of publication they relate strikes me as retaining its importance. The most important concern I have about Moretti is that I think he has the same problem that the Annalistes and world-systems analysts have had with modernity: a difficulty explaining rupture, breach, or novelty. Novelty here in multiple senses: as Elif Batuman observes, the novel-form is what gets marked off in Moretti as something not explained. In world-systems history, this problem has lately been exaggerated to extremes by some of the founding practitioners in the field, as in Andre Gunder Frank's argument late in his life that

46 

Tim Burke

the contemporary world-system is part of a continuous fivethousand year old history, that modernity or the rise of the West is a temporary or epiphenomenal speed bump in a wellworn road, not anything genuinely new. The problem with a divergent tree of literary or cultural history is that it has a hard time explaining the appearance of genuinely new forms or genres: it is forced always to insist on a fundamental continuity. The best that the world-systems historians could do, if they didn't want to follow Frank's argument that modernity or the rise of the West was an illusion, was either to insist on materialist explanations of rupture (new technologies, new means of production) or to offer shopworn dialectics. In evolutionary terms, Moretti is something of a gradualist; my impulse is to throw up the cultural equivalent of punctuated equilibria in reply, to insist that some genres and forms do not descend gracefully from predicates but emerge abruptly, catastrophically, like Aphrodite stepping from the waves. The evolutionary metaphor is a powerful one, but you want to take in even more of it than Moretti does. For one, it's fine to talk about the death of forms and genres, about how divergence fuels convergence that fuels more divergence. You can't have a metaphor that invokes evolution or speciation without death, or at least the removal of specialized forms. But it begs the question (and Moretti knows that it does) of what the fitness landscape is for cultural forms. `Emerge' in fact is the operative verb here: I think Moretti's trees in particular could benefit enormously from reference to the body of work subsumed under the heading of "emergence" or "complexity theory." Because there is an answer within that body of work to Moretti's question: what explains the divergence of literary forms? It's not an especially comforting answer, perhaps, for either Moretti or some of his critics, because it may eschew some deep underlying explanatory principle for why some genres, tropes, modes

of literary representation produce an explosion of divergent forms and why others die. In an emergent system, the place within the topology of the system where complex structures appear may be effectively random. If we take Moretti's example of Sherlock Holmes, it might be that an evolutionary tree of British fiction in the last half of the 19th Century would help us to understand why the environment was friendly to "detective fiction," what the conditions of the cultural soil were like for the growing of a new tree. But as for how Doyle's stories set the conventions of a genre and others die, are forgotten or wither, some of that might be simply termed "dumb luck". The precise moment at which a genre crystallizes may involve accidents of readership, circulation, publication and imitation. We are not required to explain that moment by arguing that Doyle somehow uniquely intuited the needs and desires of a reading public, or was distinguished through extraordinary ability. I'm echoing Gould's Wonderful Life here very consciously. This is a rebuke of traditional literary theory, historicist literary theory and even Moretti all at once: all of them assume that there is a rational way to explain cultural reproduction which relates the successful, generative or meaningful text to some underlying condition of its being: an ideological or discursive fit to its environment, a skillful or superior authorial creation of an aesthetic, or some undiscovered underlying "law" of cycles and divergences. Here maybe Moretti needs to go the next step rather than running back for the materialist security blanket as he does in closing the book. The accidental and the emergent are also, however, where we might reopen the door to agency, creativity and the will of the author and reader again. Because another thing that appears in literary and cultural history is the unpredictable generativity of authors and readers who reach from a high branch far back down the tree to create some new possibility

of representation, who take what was a junk gene in DNA of culture and from it express some meaning or representation that was deemed impossible the day before. Sometimes such authors are just Carlo Ginzberg's Menocchio, envisioning private cultural worlds that die or are forgotten; sometimes they are better situated, differently located, or even, dare we say it, more imaginative or skillful in how they excavate the literary past in order to produce new possibility. Just as I would in the end say that modernity is an emergent and in some ways accidental social structure which in turn creates the possibility for individual agency that then generates still other emergent forms through will, choice or deliberate selection, I think you can reconcile the agency of authors and readers with Moretti's graphs, maps and trees, but it does take coloring outside his lines to do so.

 A Brief Note on Moretti and Science Fiction
Adam Roberts
Towards the end of "Graphs," Moretti touches briefly on SF: neither Detective Fiction nor SF, he says, are included on his chart, "although both genres achieve their modern form about 1890 (Doyle, Wells) and undergo a major change in the 1920s, in step with the overall pattern." Nevertheless, he concedes, "their long duration seems to require a different approach." Well, I've just published the result of several years work designed to argue the case that SF has enjoyed a longer duration even than Moretti is inclined to allow. Not that he takes an unusual position with regard to the genre. There are, in a nutshell, three main views as to when SF "began": it began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in 1818; it began with H. G. Wells's Time Machine in 1895; it began with Hugo Gernsback's magazine Amazing Stories in 1926, and Gernsback's prosodically-hobbledehoy coinage "scientifiction." Moretti is arguing, broadly, that novel genres have about a quarter-century lifespan, which, even if we chose the latest possible starting place as a launching point, does indeed give SF a "long duration." In my book, however, I try to make the case for the "long history" of SF. I argue that science fiction began at the beginning of the seventeenth-century, with Kepler's Somnium (written c.1600, published 1634). My argument is more
 49

complicated than this. But for now I want to outline one way in which my 400-year version of SF chimes with Moretti's very persuasive claims for a "generational" structure to the development of novelistic forms. I proceed without teams of researchers, graphs, or indeed anything other than the braincram of only recently having finished writing my Palgrave book--which is to say, I proceed tentatively. But if Moretti is right then perhaps we need to be looking at SF not so much as a "novelistic genre" and more as a cultural mode; for we find within it certain approximately generational "vogues," which might be sketched as follows:
1. 1600s-1650s: Lunar adventure. Kepler's Somnium 1600-36; John Wilkins, The Discovery of a World in the Moone (1638); William Godwin The Man in the Moone (1638); Cyrano de Bergerac, L'Autre Monde ou les Etats et Empires de la lune [Voyage dans la Lune] (1657). 2. 1650s-1690s: Philosophical speculation and "the plurality of worlds." Athanasius Kircher, Iter exstaticum coeleste (1656); Bernard de Fontenelle, Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes (1686); Gabriel Daniel, Voyage du Monde de Descartes (1690). 3. 1700s-1750s: The alien as fantastical humanoid (encountered on earth, within earth or near above earth). Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels (1726); Voltaire's Micromégas (1750); Thomas Gray, "Luna habitabilis" (1737); Ludvig Holberg, Nikolai Klimi iter subterraneum (1741); Robert Paltock, The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins (1750). 4. 1750s-1790s: The fantastic voyage as satiric-comic buffoonery (often with pointed political allegory); this is of course something already noticeable in Swift

These two things, perhaps unsurprisingly, go together with and reinforce the climate that produced the French Revolution and its aftermath: the anonymous The Reign of George VI: 1900-1925 (1763); Louis Sebastien Mercier, L'An 2440 (1771); Nicolas-Edme Restif de la Bretonne, La découverte australe par un homme volant (1781); John Wessel Anno 7603 (1781); Restif, Les Posthumes (1805). 6. 1810s-1850s: Monsters, Mummies, Automata: Gothic Heritage SF [Hoffman, Der Sandmann (1816); Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818); Jane Loudon, The Mummy! A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (1827)]. 7. 1800s-1850s. Tales of the far future/last man tales. Cousin de Grainville Le dernier homme (1805); Mary Shelley, The Last Man (1826); Felix Bodin, Le Roman de l'avenir (1834); Prince Vladimir Odoevsky, "4338 i-god" ("The year 4338," 1840); R. F.

A couple of notes on this. Firstly, of course there's a lot of wiggle-room in these little categories. They've been arrived at subjectively and are meant to identify the core vogues for their respective topics rather than the exhaustive categorization of the field. (So for instance, obviously, plenty of utopias were written after 1915; although I'd still argue that the immediate wake of Bellamy's book saw the real heart of the vogue). Secondly, I'm aware that were I to plot these out on a graph they'd look a lot like the graph in "Graphs" ... Figure 9, to be specific. Make of that what you will.

 Maps, Iconic and Abstract
William Benzon

Though I am rather interested in maps, I admit to being a bit puzzled by the maps chapter of Moretti's book. Part of my problem is that I am comfortable, not only with the iconic maps of physical space that Moretti uses, but with the notion of a cognitive map as used by psychologists and neuroscientists, and with abstract maps of conceptual spaces used by cognitive and computer scientists. I have given considerable thought to the use of those abstract maps of conceptual spaces in the study of (literary) textual semantics. Moretti is not doing that sort of thing in this chapter, which is fine. My problem is that I don't quite see how to relate what he has done with iconic maps to thinking that I--and others--have done in terms of abstract conceptual maps. I say this, not as a criticism of his chapter, but as a statement of my difficulty in engaging with that chapter. This document is a set of comments around and about that, but arriving at no particular conclusion. It is an essay into possible sites of exploration. Cognitive Maps Let me start with the cognitive map, which is a neuro-cognitive structure through which an animal "represents" the external world. The nature of this representation is of consid56 

Maps, Iconic and Abstract

 57

erable interest to psychologists and has attracted a good deal of attention. This work is closely related to the mechanisms by which animals navigate from one place to another. I have, at one time or another, read some of this literature, but I am not expert in it. The following remarks are meant to be no more than reasonable and indicative. Animals are creatures of habit. They live in relatively fixed territories where various places serve various needs. There is a privileged place that serves as home base and there are various other places where the animal finds food and water, or danger. Many animals migrate with the seasons, sometimes over considerable distances. Finally, we should note that most animals are considerably more sensitive to odors than we are. They smell their way about the world. How is all this represented in the animal's brain? There is no reason to believe that cognitive maps are like iconic maps except, rather than being inscribed in the dirt, or on a rock, or imprinted on paper, they are somehow inscribed in neural tissue. They seem to be more like lists of significant places intertwined with bearings and headings between one place and another. The vital significance of these places is part and parcel of the map; the "map" is not a neutral spatial substrate to which vital significance is later attached. The space of cognitive maps is not merely about physical position; it is about needs and satisfiers, vantage points and opportunities for action. Given the importance of local and distant geography to animals, it is clear that the neural systems that map that geography must be sophisticated and complex (and have evolved over hundreds of millions of years). Other than the system for interpersonal relationships, these may be the most sophisticated neural systems we have. The myth narratives LeviStrauss has analyzed in, e.g. The Raw and the Cooked, would appear to intertwine these two neuro-cognitive systems, the geographical and the social.

58 

William Benzon

Vital significance seems central to Moretti's maps. It is not just that things happen in different places, but that different kinds of things happen at different kinds of places. And where people tell stories about the world around them, those stories will reflect the vital structure of that world. One wonders how conscious were the writers of the geographic structure of their world. Some years ago Donald Norman asked graduate students living in a certain building-- some of them for years--to sketch a map of their apartment (Norman, 139). Many of them made a significant error in their sketch, even thought they were sitting in the apartment when they made the sketch. Yet, they had no trouble getting around in the apartment building. Their mental model was adequate to that task, but not to the task of making a sketch. Would the authors of Moretti's texts have been able to make accurate sketches of the territory they wrote about? We do not know. But being able to make such sketches is quite a different skill from being able to navigate through the territory. In drawing his maps Moretti may thus show us something about the geography of those worlds that the writers themselves did not (quite) know. They need not have been conscious of the lay of the land--as it appears to map makers--in order for it to be implicit in their narratives. If activities are arrayed in the world in a certain spatial pattern, and the narratives faithfully represent those activities, then that pattern will be implicit in the narrative without the author ever having given explicit thought to the structure of that array. If the usage of geography changes over time, then stories told over the same time span will reflect those changes. Again, without the author's being explicitly aware of this. This is at the center of Moretti's arguments in the maps chapter. And perhaps that is what so interests him, that the narratives accurately reflect things of which the authors were

Maps, Iconic and Abstract

 59

not, need not have been, explicitly aware. Those patterns turn up in the narrative because that is how the world works. The world creeps into the mind in ways that exceed our explicit grasp. Ring Structures Because our lives are lived in geography, many of our narratives include journeys within them or take the form of a journey. Some of those narratives even include maps as part of the text--I'm thinking of e.g. Treasure Island, King Solomon's Mines, or, rather more recently, Perdido Street Station. And then we have those squiggles in Tristram Shandy which map, not the places of Tristram's or Toby's or Walter's life, but the digressive mode of the telling. Those squiggles are more abstract in their import. This leads me, in Shandian fashion, to ring structures, which are about the mode of telling. In the small, we have a rhetorical figure called chiasmus. For example, "well knows ... knows well" in Shakespeare's Sonnet 129: "This the world well knows, that none knows well . . . . " But such inversions appear in longer texts. (And they are an explicit part of the arsenal of melodic variation and development in baroque counterpoint.) A narrative will unfold through a series of steps to a mid-point and then trace its way back through the same series of steps, but in reverse, thus:
1 2 3 ... X ... 3' 2' 1'

Mary Douglas has been investigating ring structure in books of the Old Testament, while I have found it in Osamu Tezuka's graphic novel, Metropolis. The fact that rings are symmetrical about a mid-point suggests to me that they may ultimately depend on the cognitive structures we use for use for spatial navigation. If you travel from location A to N and

60 

William Benzon

then back you will pass the same landmarks on each half of the journey, but in reverse order. If things of interest and consequence happen to you along the way, both going and coming, then you may have a narrative that is interesting as well. But the ring structure of Tezuka's narrative cannot be explained through fidelity to an external geography. For it is not physical movement in space that takes the form of a ring, nor the deployment of locations in space. Tezuka's narrative is more like a picture within a frame3 within a frame2 within a frame1, where you start at the outermost frame, move to the next, the next, then the picture, and then you turn around and go back out through the series of frames. We can think of frame1 as the public world at large; frame2 is an underground world of evil conspirators and robot slaves; while frame3 is a children's world, of home, schoolhouse, and playground. (The picture itself has starting revelations.) Beyond the fact that frame2 is underground, there is no explicit sense the geographic relationships between these realms nor even of different locations within each of the realms. There is no particular reason to believe that Tezuka achieved this effect through conscious deliberation. The ring structure I've outlined is not at all obvious; uncovering it takes a bit of analytical work. Whatever forces are at work in this ring seem to me more mysterious than the material forces working on the English and German geography arrayed in the narratives Moretti examines. In those narratives the mind mirrors the external world. In Tezuka it is not clear that the mind is mirroring anything at all. Note that these ring-form narrative are different from the rings Moretti talks about. In his discussion of village narratives he illustrates physical rings in the geography that is the setting for narratives. Certain things happen in the center, other things happen closer to the periphery. But nowhere does he talk about individual narratives having episodes arrayed in a cyclic fashion.

Maps, Iconic and Abstract

 61

Thus the geographic ring and the narrative ring are different and independent phenomenon. Yet there is the possibility that the narrative ring ultimately depends on neural structures that arose for the purpose of navigating the physical world. The narrative ring is more abstract. Let us now consider a different kind of navigational abstraction. The Method of Loci [Here I simply quote from an old article of mine on Visual Thinking (Benzon 1990)]:
The locus classicus for any discussion of visual thinking is the method of loci, a technique for aiding memory invented by Greek rhetoricians and which, over a course of centuries, served as the starting point for a great deal of speculation and practical elaboration--an intellectual tradition which has been admirably examined by Frances Yates. The idea is simple. Choose some fairly elaborate building, a temple was usually suggested, and walk through it several times along a set path, memorizing what you see at various fixed points on the path. These points are the loci which are the key to the method. Once you have this path firmly in mind so that you can call it up at will, you are ready to use it as a memory aid. If, for example, you want to deliver a speech from memory, you conduct an imaginary walk through your temple. At the first locus you create a vivid image which is related to the first point in your speech and then you "store" that image at the locus. You repeat the process for each successive point in the speech until all of the points have been stored away in the loci on the path through the temple. Then, when you give your speech you simply start off on the imaginary path, retrieving your ideas from each locus in turn.

62 

William Benzon

The technique could also be used for memorizing a speech word-for-word. In this case, instead of storing ideas at a loci, one stored individual words.

The method of loci has become a central part of our "memory improvement" lore. Further, the effectiveness of this technique has been verified in psychological laboratories. According to Ulric Neisser, a cognitive psychologist, it even works for people who deny that they have mental images. What is interesting about this technique is that it involves the deliberate creation of a cognitive model that is affectively and motivationally neutral. One memorizes a particular physical space simply as a set of loci and paths between them. The loci have no intrinsic significance. Rather, they are mental "pigeon holes" in which one can place things that do have significance. What kind of "things"? Anything you can imagine. Notice, in particular, how there is no necessary relationship between the topographic structure of the loci and the logical structure of whatever is committed to memory through those loci. If you were to listen to someone deliver a speech which he or she had committed to memory using the method of loci, there would be nothing in the speech that would betray the building used to establish the loci and the path used to traverse them. It would, in principle, be possible for two people to deliver pretty much the same speech, while using different buildings as their memory model. That, in general, is the problem we face in trying to figure out how the mind deals with literary texts. However visible the texts, the mind's mechanisms are hidden. Moretti's maps tell us something of how the mind finds the world. But just how is it that the world makes its way into the mind there to be transformed into texts? That process remains invisible.

 a Hundred Flowers
eric hayot

Part I: Let a hundred flowers bloom Moretti's work only becomes a "problem" for literary studies when it claims that its method ought to replace the ones currently in use. So far as I know it does not. Ergo: what's the problem? Let a hundred flowers bloom. The more ways we have of studying what we're interested in, the better. There may be problems with the metaphors or with the statistics Moretti uses. Christopher Prendergast makes the case against certain of Moretti's moves fairly clear in his NLR response (the short version, focused on the argument in "Trees": there's no reason to suppose culture functions like nature). This is fine; the "rest" of literary studies is also a place filled with people arguing about the validity of one methodology or another. No one says that we should all stop using etymologies to close read because Heidegger knowingly used false ones. Let a hundred flowers bloom. If it can be improved or modified--and of course it can--then Moretti's method (call it distant reading, Annalesstyle longue durée historicism, or sociology of literature) will benefit from having more people engaged in it. Presumably these people will disagree. This will increase the number of epistemological possibilities, some of which will prove more convincing than others. Perhaps even that movement could
64 

A Hundred Flowers

 65

be the subject of a Moretti-style evolutionary study. In any case: let a hundred flowers bloom. Why, then, is Moretti's work controversial? Partly because what he is doing is new and interesting, and partly because it comes at a moment when the last major wave of new ideas seems to have foundered. Many people seem to want a new Theory to replace the exhausted old Theory. These people need to relax. Moretti is like a guy who shows up to the party with liquor right after the keg has been emptied. Part of why he is welcome is because he is saving some people from boredom or despair (he writes: "it is precisely in the name of theoretical knowledge that `Theory' should be forgotten, and replaced with the extraordinary array of conceptual constructions--theories, plural, and with a lower case `t'--developed by the natural and the social sciences" ("Trees," 63).) People who are desperate to cling to the old keg--either because they have grown to love it, or because they think there's still beer in there--sometimes feel threatened by the new guy at the party, and want to say that he shouldn't be at the party at all. But surely there's room for the beer drinkers and the liquor drinkers in the room; let a hundred flowers bloom. In this I am more catholic than Moretti himself, who in the lines I cite above seems to want everyone to move away from the keg and get to the good stuff they're drinking over at the science fraternities. From another perspective what Moretti is doing is not that new at all. Louis Menand points out in a Profession 2005 essay that literary studies has always transformed itself by borrowing wholesale from other disciplinary structures. "Theory" as a branch (so thick it became a root) of literary studies produced its momentum out of encounters with linguistics (Saussure, Jakobson), anthropology (Lévi-Strauss), sociology (the Frankfurt School, Bourdieu), psychology (Freud, Lacan), history (Canguilhem, Foucault) and phi-

66 

Eric Hayot

losophy (Derrida, Levinas, Nancy, Lyotard, not to mention Marx, Hegel, and so on). The "real" linguists, anthropologists, sociologists and philosophers go on to decry literary studies' adulteration of their ideas; rinse and repeat. In this sense the newness of Moretti is just the kind of newness we in literary studies have always wanted. I would not be surprised if this newness operates on 25-year, generational cycles (though in the academic humanities you might have to account for the distortions produced by the nine years it takes, on average, to get a Ph.D). Will I go on to do Moretti-style studies of literature? No; close reading mixed with deconstructive theory makes me happiest. Would I welcome someone doing Moretti's kind of work as a colleague? Of course I would. Will I suspect such a colleague of falling too far into sociology and forgetting about language? Will I wonder if s/he has turned the longue durée into a fetish? Certainly. But that's what argument and conversation are for; flowers don't just pollinate themselves. Part two: what's so funny 'bout peace, love, and interpretation? The most polemical thing Moretti writes appears in the last paragraph of "Trees," where he says that his approaches "share a clear preference for explanation over interpretation." This reminds me of Lindsay Waters' recent piece in the Chronicle (already blogged about on The Valve by Miriam Burstein and Daniel Green). Waters claims that a recent book by Walter Benn Michaels exemplifies what's gone wrong with English in the past forty years: "the complete and total ascendancy of hermeneutics. Instead of the erotics of art, we've got the neurotics of art: the meaning-mongering of interpretation for its own sake." What's wrong with interpretation? It sucks the life out of beauty, says Waters. It can't see "the larger structures within

which [novels] have meaning in the first place," says Moretti. Both these claims seem ridiculous to me, Waters' because he has no idea what I think of as beautiful, and Moretti's because of the word "first." But that's not really want I want to talk about: rather it seems interesting to me that two people who couldn't, presumably, disagree more about what literary studies should do and be (for Waters "beauty" is not in graphs or maps but in the ineffable experience of reading) both decide to frame their remarks as an attack on the primacy ("first" again) of interpretation. As Prendergast points out in his NLR piece, these claims are, of course, interpretations. Amateur deconstruction aside, however (not that Prendergast himself is either amateur or deconstructive), one might wonder--and this is a historical question sustained by a close reading--why right now, in January 2006, "interpretation" has become the word for what's wrong with literary studies (as Waters points out, Sontag's "Against Interpretation" is now 40 years old). A serious historical answer to this question would require recourse to the kind of resources marshaled by a Nora project or the gang at Google, or an army of graduate students, or perhaps just a few more hours of time than I'm willing to spend on it. Nonetheless let me gesture towards an answer by suggesting that "interpretation" actually means something different in each case. For Waters (as for Sontag) "interpretation" valorizes the study of the text as a hermeneutic exercise blind to aesthetic pleasure. Making the text speak as an instance of pseudo-philosophy (this is what Keats is telling us about the relation between truth and beauty), pseudo-architecture (this is how Keats tells us about that relation), or pseudohistory (this is what Keats tells us about the understanding of truth and beauty in his era) instrumentalizes the beauty that is the subject of the text in the "first" place, and thus

68 

Eric Hayot

constitutes a kind of technologization of the real that is part of the life-destroying force of modernity (my rhetoric here matching Waters', if you care to read his piece). For Moretti, on the other hand, "interpretation" suggests a kind of belletristic focus on the text at the expense of the "larger structures" and "temporal cycles" within which the form, as the subject of a materialist history, operates. Interpretation does not arrive at the "first" place of the text because it fetishizes local meaning at the expense of historical materialism. Though Moretti believes that no "single explanatory framework may account for the many levels of literary production and their multiple links with the larger social system," what he's interested in are "production" and "social systems," not interpretations which are themselves presumably only expressions of those systems or attempts to ignore them. My theory of the historically negative force of "interpretation" in January 2006 will, it seems, have to account for the fact that "interpretation" means different things to different people who could nonetheless, through a distant enough reading, be seen to be arguing against the same thing. Does this "close" (not that close, frankly) reading of "interpretation" suggest that a more "distant" historical analysis of its appearance has lost all claim to the truth? No, because it still matters, I think, that the word "interpretation" is used in both cases. But I am suggesting that such a distant reading without an accompanying close reading will be missing out on at least some of the truth, just as a myopic focus on the difference between these uses of interpretation will fail to grasp the broader historical context within which they function. There is no room for "first" or "second" place in such a scheme. Rather there is an accommodating sense that no one method has all the answers, one that should produce a corresponding modesty about interpretive claims.

A Hundred Flowers

 69

I say it again: let a hundred flowers bloom. This is not a simple metaphor (just ask the ones Mao beheaded). Blooming is connected to reproduction, which is, as Moretti knows, a competitive process. In a few generations some flowers will be gone, and new ones will emerge; there's not enough room in the field for everyone. Some very good people will be kept out by the dominant modes of criticism--try writing a dissertation on "hubris in Byron" these days and see how far it gets you--and some others will flower perhaps even more than they deserve, thanks to shifts in the critical winds. But the field of literary studies is not the same as a field in nature, the difference being that in literature the blooms exert some control (never as much as they'd like) over their environment. Letting others bloom requires opening yourself to the possibility of being taken, or overtaken, by the other flowers in the field, allowing yourself to be seduced by the idea that in the long run someone else is more important than you. That admission can cripple you, or it can return as an affirmation. Molly, blooming, knew this:
"I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes"

 Moretti Responds
franco moretti

Many thanks to everybody writing about the book--and four brief rejoinders. Does work like mine belong in a History department, rather than in English? I take the idea as a compliment-- trying to make literary study a part of historical research has always been a fixation of mine. Does this abolish the pleasure of reading literature? No--it just means that between the pleasure and the knowledge of literature [or at least a large part of knowledge] there is no continuity. Knowing is not reading. Are literary cycles limited to the 19th century? I doubt it. Virtually all the evidence I know of [from studies in French, British, and other Western European literatures] points to the existence of genre cycles well before then, and the 20th century largely confirms the pattern, in literature and outside [think of war films, or westerns]. Of course, it remains to be seen how much of the literary [and cultural] field is affected by cycles. But even if it's only 50%, wouldn't that be a significant find? Is it possible that relying on secondary sources may produce distortions? Of course. Point out a large enough number of distortions, and I will abandon the enterprise. But I'm not going to do so simply because of the "possibility" of a distortion. I firmly believe in falsifiability, but falsification is a matter of fact, not of possibility.

Do maps reveal very little about literature? Well, it depends. Those of village stories, for instance, bring to light a type of spatial perception that would be hard to envisage otherwise. The map of Paris from the Atlas--especially in connection with the London maps from the same book--explains why youth and social class play such different roles in the two traditions. And so on. Still, a lot of people have that reaction to maps--"Of course things are this way. What's the big deal?" So, may I suggest a little wager-experiment? Sometime in the future I'd like to make maps of regional narratives [Hardy, Verga]. Why don't map-skeptics write in advance what I will "obviously" find--and we compare the results once the maps are done?

Some more thoughts: First, a few details. I am less alone than I claim. Excellent. I didn't even know of the existence of the nora project, which seems very interesting, and I have now several new titles on my reading list, which is great. As for evolutionary approaches, I would be more cautious; some of them--like memetics, or the recent Literary Animal collection--strike me as naïve in their disregard for formal analysis, and passion for fuzzy or crude units of content. Maps, no, there I am really alone, unfortunately (the idea of a literary atlas began as a collective project, and I ended up working on my own only when the first project was denied funding, and dissolved). Even Bill Benzon's very interesting post, as he says right away, is on a different type of map (his final question--how is it that the world makes its way into the mind there to be transformed into texts?--is however one of the truly Great Questions in front of us. I wish I knew what to answer). One caveat for the more optimistic contributors. The field of, loosely speaking, science and literature is full of false starts. The best example of quantitative analysis ever done--Burrows' multivariate analysis of Austen's style--was published 20 years ago, and has had, if I'm not mistaken, hardly any effects. (No one has mentioned it in the course of this discussion either.) We're all working uphill, and I'm not sure it's going to change soon.

Close reading and abstract models, or, interpretation and explanation. Bill Benzon is absolutely right in saying that even in the sciences research is not evenly spread, but clusters around specific issues--the fruit fly is a particularly neat example, because detective fiction is a sort of literary fruit fly (with few and clear variables, easy to manipulate). But this is not close reading, it's actually much more similar to the "experiments" (on village stories etc.) that I try to do in the book. So, I still think that the strategies I outlined are antithetical to the mainstream of literary criticism. It may be tactically silly for me to say so now, given that the general consensus is that what I do could be interesting, as long as it doesn't want to get rid of current procedures, but what can I do, this is not a matter of bragging, or of originality (originality, in a book that borrows all its models?!), or of democracy (a hundred flowers, yes, and more)-- it's a matter of logic. Between interpretation (that tends to make a close reading of a single text) and explanation (that works with abstract models on a large groups of texts) I see an antithesis. Not just difference, but an either/or choice. This said, I understand Eric Hayot's skepticism about how I formulate the antithesis at the end of the book: I am not happy with it either, and in the response to Prendergast's article I will try a different take, stressing the causal aspects of explanation, which are usually absent from interpretation. In a formula, interpretation posits a relationship between a meaning and another meaning, and explanation a (causal) relationship between an external force (or constraint) and one or more meanings. And then again, it may well be that the study of literature will always require, or be enriched by, both close reading and abstraction, interpretations and explanations; but this will amount to saying that literature requires two conceptually opposite approaches. Which is odd, and

Moretti Responds (II)

 75

will make for some interesting speculation on why it should be so. Finally, Tim Burke's "dumb luck" argument. (My favorite formulation comes from the extinction specialist David Raup: "Bad genes or bad luck?") It is certainly possible that dumb luck plays/played a much larger role than we imagine--probably larger and larger as we move back in history, and cultural products can disappear more easily. I will enlarge on this in my reply to Prendergast, but I may as well admit right away that every time I have studied competition, success, and failure, I have never found that luck played a major role (the only one exception I know: Austen's novels, despite having soldiers, include no reference to war, unlike most of her contemporaries, and the so-called "Hundred Years' Peace" that begun in 1815 rewarded her enormously for her choice: sheer external luck changing the world, and hence the expectations of generations of readers). (Needless to say, this is not the only ingredient in Austen's long-term success). But I admire Gould too, and would have liked to find instances of dumb luck. If anyone comes up with convincing examples, I'd love to see them. And I do need to add, I don't ignore book history (it's the starting point of "Graphs," and about 50% of my last book), nor punctuated equilibria (which I first applied to literary history 20 years ago, and have used in the three books I have written since.) Thanks again to all of you for the ideas and the challenges.

 Totality and the Genes of Literature
Jonathan Goodwin
"Suppose at this juncture we were to state the blindingly obvious: that, whatever their other properties, literary texts do not possess genes" ("Graphs," 59). So begins the "Perils of Analogy" section of Christopher Prendergast's response to Moretti. Notwithstanding the Paris Review interviews, it does seem difficult to maintain that literature has genes. Does it have memes, however? Ideologemes? Maybe. And I will discuss metaphors of cultural transmission and evolutionary analogies in Moretti's argument. The coherence of the meme concept is by no means obvious, and memes are not by any definition atomistic. Rukmini Nair suggests in Narrative Gravity that narrative is adapted to meme transmission (205). And the description of the Genre Evolution Project at the University of Michigan describes three versions of generic change: Leavis's great man, Lukács' great circumstance, and Barthes' great form. All are distinct from the biological model of generic evolution as envisioned by that project and also by Moretti. Biological evolution is mostly divergent (gene transfer and other poorly understood mechanisms being convergent) whereas cultural evolution is largely convergent with divergence resulting from the contingencies of imperfect transfer. Prendergast criticizes Moretti for overemphasizing divergence and suggests that it lends itself analogically to market-reification (61).
76

Moretti ends "Maps" with a quote from D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's On Growth and Form: "We rise from a conception of form to an understanding of the forces which gave rise to it [. . .] and in the comparison of kindred forms [. . .] we discern the magnitude and the direction of the forces which we have sufficed to convert the one form into the other" (103). The phrase "diagram of forces in equilibrium" is elided in the quote and appears in the last sentence of the chapter, minus "equilibrium" (Thompson, 1027). Thompson, translator of Aristotle's biological treatises, knew better than to use the word "entelechy" lightly; but I think it relevant here. A morphological divergence is where a potentiality has become an actuality; and the Aristotelian connotation of completion or perfection does not necessarily entail triumphalism, as I think Prendergast suggests. So how to analyze the form of this governing force? Must we suppose that literature is a machine? I refer to the Galilean/Newtonian notion of the mechanism:
The modern scientific revolution, from Galileo, was based on the thesis that the world is a great machine, which could in principle be constructed by a master artisan, a complex version of the clocks and other intricate automata that fascinated the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, much as computers have a provided a stimulus to thought and imagination in recent years; the change of artifacts has limited consequences for the basic issue as Alan Turing demonstrated sixty years ago. (66)

Chomsky also observes that Newton refuted forever the "mechanical philosophy"(67). All that is left scientifically is the study of emergence in various forms. Supposing that this is true of scientific theories about the natural world, is it true of the study of literature? Can imaginative literature be coherently described as a machine constructed by a master artisan? How about the novel, spe-

78 

Jonathan Goodwin

cifically? Is the novel a species of theory-construction, of modeling? Does it explain the world by simplifying it, or does it contain, through extrinsic immanence, an image (or monad) of everything possible to be believed at the moment of its production? If not, perhaps the various genres at any given moment together form the well-rounded totality. "The individual work does not do justice to the genres by subsuming itself to them but rather through the conflict in which it long legitimated them, then engendered them, and ultimately canceled them" (Adorno, 208). You could apply this dialectic, mutatis mutandis, to organisms and species. Here's Moretti on the generic speciation-event (or extinction): "where a genre exhausts its potentialities--and the time comes to give the competitor a chance--when its inner form can no longer represent the most significant aspect of contemporary reality: at which point, either the genre betrays its form in the name of reality, thereby disintegrating, or it betrays reality in the name of form, becoming a `dull epigone' indeed" ("Maps," 77 n8). I am reminded here of Richard Goldschmidt's "hopeful monsters" from The Material Basis of Evolution, a concept and work reintroduced and recuperated to some extent by Stephen Jay Gould. Through developmental mechanisms, Goldschmidt argues, "a new type may emerge without accumulation of small steps" (251).Though not atomistic, combinable units, ideologemes may serve as an analyzable unit of developmental constraint. The word was probably first used by Bakhtin and/or Medvedev in The Formal Method of Literary Scholarship, and it appears most prominently in Bakhtin's "Discourse and the Novel" (333-35). Michael Holquist notes there that Bakhtin intends the term neutrally (429). The most influential discussion of ideologemes is in Jameson's The Political Unconscious:

Jonathan Goodwin

 79

An amphibious formulation whose essential structural characteristic may be described as its possibility to manifest itself either as a pseudoidea--a conceptual or belief system, an abstract value, an opinion or prejudice--or as a protonarrative, a kind of ultimate class fantasy about the "collective characters" which are the classes in opposition. (87)

Jameson further suggests that ideological analysis requires showing how the finished cultural product is a "complex work of transformation on the ultimate raw material which is the ideologeme in question" (87). As Turing wrote in his influential paper about morphogenesis, "Most of an organism, most of the time, is developing from one pattern into another, rather than from homogeneity into a pattern" (71-2). Ideologemes are similar to Turing's morphogens in that they serve as developmental constraints on the production of a given text. It's worth supposing that narrative ecologies are optimally adapted to their historic environments and there is an inherently perfect transformation of experience in the act of narrative creation. The narrative property constructs abstract models, shares species-invariant characteristics, and integrates its individual variations into the totality of the social imagination: Coleridge's distinction of the primary and secondary imaginations ends by noting that the latter is "essentially vital" (167). This vitality of the secondary imagination allows the close reader to invent plausible historical claims, and distant readings of the state of the primary imagination discovers their context.

 Distant Reading Minds
Steven Berlin Johnson
Full disclosures first: Moretti is a friend, and was my advisor for several years during my grad school days at Columbia in the early nineties. I was there at the beginning of this project; I can still remember the slightly baffled silence the followed his announcement--over dinner with a half dozen grad students--that the future of literary criticism was going to lie in map-making. I spent an insane number of hours generating some of the first maps for him over the next year, using some now-obsolete cartography software that was, to say the least, not optimized for mapping narratives. So perhaps I'm biased by my fondness for Moretti--or by the desire not to think of all those hours generating maps as wasted ones--but I really do think that the two books that eventually emerged out of this research (Atlas Of The European Novel and Graphs, Maps, Trees) constitute a welcome and significant turning point in recent literary criticism. Just the density of ideas in Graphs, Maps, Trees alone is noteworthy; most scholars would have spun the analysis of genre cycles into an entire book, but Moretti gives you ten pages on it, and marches on to the next case study. It's exhilarating stuff, and I wouldn't have it any other way, but it does feel like we're going to be spending the next ten years unpacking some of these examples. When Jonathan asked me to contribute to this discussion, he suggested one of the topics I might address would be the connection between my work in Everything Bad Is Good
 81

Steven Berlin Johnson

For You, and Moretti's model in Graphs, Maps, Trees. As it happened, Moretti and I had just been exchanging a series of email messages remarking on how our thinking had developed along parallel lines since we both left Columbia. I talk about this a little in the Appendix to Everything Bad: the shift from a symbolic model to a systemic model. Most criticism ultimately involves, in one fashion or another, decoding the literary work to find the hidden meaning that lurks behind it. What form that meaning takes depends on the kind of critic you are: the genius of the author, the zeitgeist, the class struggle, the unconscious, the subaltern, différance. But the systemic approach to culture isn't looking for hidden meaning in the same way. This is how I described it in Everything Bad:
My argument for the existence of the sleeper effect comes out of an assumption that the landscape of popular culture involves the clash of competing forces: the neurological appetites of the brain, the economics of the culture industry, changing technological platforms. The specific ways in which those forces collide plays a determining role in the type of popular culture we ultimately consume. The work of the critic, in this instance, is to diagram those forces, not decode them. Sometimes, for the sake of argument, I find it helpful to imagine culture as a kind of man-made weather system. Float a mass of warm, humid air over cold ocean water, and you'll create an environment in which fog will thrive. The fog doesn't appear because it somehow symbolically re-enacts the clash of warm air and cool water. Fog arrives instead as an emergent effect of that particular system and its internal dynamics. The same goes for culture....

Distant Reading Minds

 83

Diagramming not decoding: you can hear the Moretti disciple loud and clear in that language. (You can also hear a little Manuel DeLanda, for what it's worth.) But the passage also points to an area that I hope Moretti will turn to next. You can't analyze the literary system purely from the bird'seye-view of distant reading. You need to zoom in as much as you need to zoom out: all the way to the human brain itself. Consider this passage from Graphs, Maps, Trees:
Everybody, from the first readers onwards, had noticed the country walks of Our Village; but no one had ever reflected on the circular pattern they project on the English countryside, because no one--in the absence of a map of the book--had ever managed to actually see it. (53)

Those readers might not have seen that circular pattern, but on some level, they must have perceived it; it must have shaped their experience of Our Village in some meaningful way. Otherwise, it's just a random pattern, formalist trivia, like discovering there are the same exact number of words beginning with "c" and "t" in the novel. The same goes for Conan Doyle and his rivals: the reading audience isn't consciously analyzing the formal properties of a stack of detective stories, and saying: "You know, I really like the ones with decodable clues." But nonetheless they're somehow processing those formal innovations, and building a sensibility around them, a preference for one configuration over the others. So my question for Moretti is: how does this happen? How is the reader influenced by formal properties without being fully conscious of the influence? Graphs, Maps, Trees is silent on the question--understandably so, since he's got his hands full persuading us of the birds-eye-perspective. But a systemic theory has to work at all the relevant scales. All the science and empiricism of distant reading disappears when

84 

Steven Berlin Johnson

you get down to the level of the reader's mind: we're left with watered-down Freud: somehow the reader unconsciously digests the form, emphasis on "somehow." (I tried my hand at this approach for a few pages in Everything Bad--explaining how the formal architecture of reward and exploration in gaming connects to the brain's so-called "seeking circuitry.") In filling in the gap, I suspect that the cognitive sciences will be more relevant than evolutionary psychology, despite the fact that the Darwinian approach to literature has been attracting all the buzz lately. I'm less interested in where the brain's capacity for apprehending formal variation came from, and more interested in how it works. No doubt some these cognitive tools for apprehending literary form will turn out to be spandrels, or even exclusively the product of cultural training. That won't make those tools any less interesting. But we need to be able to talk with some rigor about how those semi-conscious assessments take hold in the brain--the same rigor that Moretti has applied to the system of literature itself. Right now all we have is superstition ...

 The Next Cigarette and a Modest Garnish
jenny davidson

Something makes me yearn for certain brand-new books like a smoker plotting how to get her hands on the next cigarette, so that I will order Kazuo Ishiguro's latest at great expense from Amazon UK because of a release date three weeks earlier than in the US (worth every penny, by the way) or hit three different Cambridge bookstores in search of a non-sold-out copy of On Beauty in its first week of publication (perhaps not so satisfying an investment of time and money). I can't put my finger on exactly what produces that yearning in me, but it is far less likely to be prompted by a work of literary criticism than by a novel, and I was surprised to find myself coveting Franco Moretti's Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History to the point of being unwilling to wait for it to turn up at the library. Indeed, the book has proved just as enjoyable as I expected, a highly stimulating read, though not perhaps as shocking as the flap copy suggests (in addition to the "heretical" counting and mapping there is a great deal of reading and thinking and arguing of a more familiar humanistic kind). What follows below: a few reflections on the book's style and methodology from the perspective of a reader at once seduced and
 85

86 

Jenny Davidson

rendered wary by a distinctive quality of Moretti's writing that Elif Batuman has labeled "the irresistible magnetism of the diabolical." For me, the puzzle of the book concerns how seriously we're meant to take Moretti's grand flourishes in celebration of the quantitative. Moretti is of course aware of the self-contradictory aspects of his exercise. Following his quite wonderful bar graphs of the longevity of British novelistic genres between 1740 and 1915 (all the way from the courtship novel through the industrial novel and the school story to the New Woman novel and the Kailyard School), Moretti offers this admission in a footnote:
See here how a quantitative history of literature is also a profoundly formalist one--especially at the beginning and at the end of the research process. At the end, for the reasons we have just seen; and at the beginning, because a formal concept is usually what makes quantification possible in the first place: since a series must be composed of homogeneous objects, a morphological category is needed--`novel', `antiJacobin novel', `comedy', etc.--to establish such homogeneity. (GMT 25 n. 14)

Is this a damaging admission, or a savvy one? The latter, I'd say, but it also only hints at my reservations about the claims of the chapter on "graphs." As a scholar working in the field of eighteenth-century British literature and culture, I find Moretti's work around these questions fruitful but its distinctiveness or originality somewhat overstated. You don't have to be a heroic scientific pioneer and experimentalist to uncover the patterns in longforgotten British novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; Ruth Perry's recent Novel Relations, for instance,

The Next Cigarette

 87

reaps the rewards of a lifetime of reading eighteenth-century fiction to discern patterns (the rise of the novel of the second attachment, the trope of the cri de sang) that are as illuminating as Moretti's graphs about literary and social history. Moretti does not toil alone, in other words, and though his professional peers may lack his flair, they possess their own sorts of acumen; I'm thinking in particular of Gary Kelly's excellent work on the fiction of the 1790s and of Katie Trumpener and Claudia Johnson on the novels of Austen's generation and beyond. In a footnote to an earlier essay, "The Slaughterhouse of Literature," Moretti dismisses as socially insignificant the canon-bashing English professors who want simply to replace Jane Austen with Amelia Opie, but reading Opie's fiction alongside Austen's offers unusually clear and convincing evidence for why it's worth reading "minor" authors alongside their "major" contemporaries.1 Elsewhere, in an essay called "Recovering Ellen Pickering," Poovey-- prompted by the wording of an invitation from the British Women Writers Association--"gave some thought to the entire project of canon revision" and "decided to choose, virtually at random, a woman writer I had never heard of, read as much of her work as I could, then determine how, if at all, I could `recover' this writer for modern scholars and students." And she includes some great diagrams! (Poovey's essay is followed by thoughtful responses from Margaret Homans and Jill Campbell, both well worth a look.) Moretti isn't interested in chronicling these parallel developments in recent scholarship; nor does he acknowledge what is at the very least a broad family resemblance between his own work and that of another remarkable literary scholar, Wai Chee Dimock, who has also recently invoked Braudel in her call for the study of culture to become "planetary in scope."2

88 

Jenny Davidson

Graphs, Maps, Trees is a short manifesto, of course, a call for change rather than a survey of the field, so such exclusions are entirely understandable. More troubling for me is the undisputable fact that the vast quantitative-collaborative research project whose virtues Moretti propounds has something Pied-Piper-esque about it; without Moretti's own imagination and critical intelligence and deep knowledge of world literature driving it, doesn't the soul go out of the whole enterprise? We're speaking here about a scholar whose powerful intellect and imaginative scope have meant that he himself can make wonderful use of the human-graduate-student-equivalent of a commodity-cluster supercomputer; but without Moretti directing the whole enterprise, the prospects for communal enrichment come to look rather more bleak. I don't dispute the striking insightfulness of Moretti's treatment of the distinction between village stories and provincial novels, in other words; he concludes in this case that villages and regions are homelands, whereas provinces are defined against a more desirable metropolitan center and are thus "`negative' entities, defined by what is not there," unmappable forms since "you cannot map what is not there" (53). And perhaps the most alluring instance of Moretti's diabolical charm comes in the sentence immediately following, which is both eminently reasonable and provocative to the point of being dandyish: "It happens, there are un-mappable forms (Christmas stories are another one, for different reasons), and these setbacks, disappointing at first, are actually the sign of a method still in touch with reality: geography is a useful tool, yes, but does not explain everything" (53). Oh, go ahead, do tell me why Christmas stories are unmappable! (I'm not being at all sarcastic; I really want to know . . . .) Might you be thinking in particular of "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle," the most famous Holmesian Christmas story, or does this sentence itself mimic the effect of the

unreadable clues of Conan Doyle and his contemporaries, providing something that looks awfully like a clue but resists interpretation because of an absence of meaningful context? Moretti is surely poking a bit of fun at himself here, writing in a style close to self-parody, as when he offers a flippant aside right after that modest disclaimer about geography's failure to explain everything ("For that, we have astrology and `Theory'"). But this is Moretti's own personal insightfulness, not a blueprint for cultural development; despite the easy availability of quantitative techniques, in other words, it's hard for me to think of a school of literary interpretation less suited to reproduction on a mass scale. I take the richest payoff here in terms of literary history, then, to be an insight that has also been arrived at elsewhere and by other routes. The "real content of the controversy", Moretti says, "is our very idea of culture":
Because if the basic mechanism of change is that of divergence, then cultural history is bound to be random, full of false starts, and profoundly pathdependent: a direction, once taken, can seldom be reversed, and culture hardens into a true `second nature'--hardly a benign metaphor. If, on the other hand, the basic mechanism is that of convergence, change will be frequent, fast, deliberate, reversible: culture becomes more plastic, more human, if you wish. But as human history is so seldom human, this is perhaps not the strongest of arguments. (81)

The relationship between trees and contingency (and the chapter on "Trees," with its treatment of the clue in the detective story of Conan Doyle's time, seems to me by far the most interesting) is something about which Moretti is even more explicit in an earlier essay, discussing the same idea. There he calls the failure of Conan Doyle's rivals--and indeed of the

90 

Jenny Davidson

creator of Sherlock Holmes himself--to explore the full literary potential of the clue "a good instance of the rigidity of literary evolution":
you only learn once; then you are stuck. You learn, so it's culture, not nature: but it's a culture which is as unyielding as DNA. And the consequence of this is that literary changes don't occur slowly, piling up one small improvement upon another: they are abrupt, structural, and leave very little room for transitional forms. ("Slaughterhouse," 222)

The tree's payoff, in other words, mainly concerns contingency: "What the tree says is that literary history could be different from what it is" ("Slaughterhouse," 227). Interesting, true; but didn't we know that already? And culture can be as deterministic as nature, no surprise to Montesquieu and the eighteenth-century climate theorists (or for that matter to William James). In the book's version of the "Trees" piece, Moretti's discussion of the clue segues into a really wonderful treatment of "the still numerous `ways of being alive' discovered between 1800 and 2000 by that great narrative device known as `free indirect style'" (81). This, for me, was the most thought-provoking part of the discussion and yet also the one that bore the least resemblance to the polemical version of "distant reading" and looked most like good old-fashioned twentiethcentury literary criticism, with a kind of geographical expansiveness that owes more to earlier generations of scholars of comparative literature than to recent work in the life sciences. Moretti's figure 33, "Free indirect style in modern narrative, 1800-2000," has this legend below: "This figure reflects work in progress, and is therefore quite tentative, especially in the case of non-European literatures, and of the diachronic span of the various branches" (84). But isn't this just a way

of fancying-up, so to speak, the insights of Moretti's critical prose, itself a supple and powerful enough tool to operate diagramless? We don't need this "schematic visualization" (82); Moretti's thoughts on Austen and Flaubert and Dostoevskyby-way-of-Bakhtin are the meat here, the figure possibly just a modish garnish to be set aside before tucking into the main dish.

John Holbo

In "Trees," Moretti speculates about literary `character' traits that may confer `evolutionary advantage'. A candidate case: the clue as detective fiction device [see figure 3, p. 49]. Moretti sketches a tree. I'll quote the expository accompaniment:
Two things were immediately clear: the `formal' fact that several of Doyle's rivals (those on the left) did not use clues--and the `historical' fact that they were all forgotten. It is a good illustration of what the literary market is like: ruthless competition--hinging on form. Readers discover that they like a certain device, and if a story doesn't seem to include it, they simply don't read it (and the story becomes extinct). This pressure of cultural selection probably explains the second branching of the tree, where clues are present, but serve no real function: as in `Race with the Sun', for instance, where a clue reveals to the hero that the drug is in the third cup of coffee, and then, when he is offered the third cup, he actually drinks it. Which is indeed `perplexing & unintelligible', and the only possible explanation is that these writers realized that
92 

Judging Books by Their Covers

 93

clues were popular, and tried to smuggle them into their stories--but hadn't really understood how clues worked, and so didn't use them very well. Let me jump a paragraph to an objection Moretti tries to answer. The tree in question assumes morphology is key. "But why should form be the decisive reason for survival? Why not social privilege instead--the fact that Doyle was writing for a well-established magazine and his rivals were not?" Moretti tries to solve for this variable by establishing that Doyle's choice perch in Strand Magazine was shared by others. Not only that, there was more `genetic diversity' just in Strand than even fig. 3 suggests (see fig. 4). Very interesting, but let's step back up into the above paragraph and run a variant objection. "Readers discover that they like a certain device, and if a story doesn't seem to include it, they simply don't read it (and the story becomes extinct)." The problem is: Moretti's tree plots actual inclusions, not seeming ones. And anyway: how does a story set about seeming to include something before you've actually read it? You sell books to people who haven't read them yet, hence who don't know what they contain. On the other hand, Doyle's longue durée endurance run is plausibly due in large part to his stories' winning forms: people like clues, especially those who are fans of the genre of mystery stories. (Yes, there's certainly no danger of it turning out that people don't like clues. So what are we hoping to learn that we didn't know already?) Let's be a bit artificial and say the literary competition takes place in two stages: first, a book will be `judged by its cover', and must win; if it wins, it gets the chance to be widely judged for what is between its covers. If it wins again, it `avoids extinction', i.e. becomes a classic (or at least doesn't flash in the pan.) Just yesterday Jenny Davidson began her post by writing: "Something makes me yearn for certain brand-new books like a smoker plotting how to get her hands on the next cigarette ... I can't put my finger on exactly what produces that yearning

in me ..." And just yesterday I linked to Art Spiegelman's tale of first love. "She was a paperback cover girl and I couldn't keep my hands off her." I think we're all acquainted with some such experience of seeming. It isn't pure black arts of marketing, I trust. On the other hand, there are such arts. A few weeks ago [Wednesday 28 December 2005] the Guardian ran a piece about statisticians trying to predict bestsellers not from covers but titles:
The team of three statisticians, helped by programmers, studied 54 years of fiction number ones in the New York Times and the 100 favourite novels in the BBC's Big Read poll. Comparing these with a control group of less successful novels by the same authors, they found that the winning books had three common features; they had metaphorical, or figurative titles instead of literal ones; the first word was a pronoun, a verb, an adjective or a greeting; and their grammar patterns took the form either of a possessive case with a noun, or of an adjective and noun or of the words The ... of ... By this formula the most perfect titles were Agatha Christies' last thriller Sleeping Murder (1976) and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, both with 83% marks. The poorest was Patricia Cornwell's thriller Cause of Death, with 9%. British authors produced the highest-scoring titles in both studies. John Le Carre was the most consistent with Smiley's People, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, The Tailor of Panama and others. Dr Winkler said: "When we tested our model on 700 titles published over 50 years, it correctly predicted whether a book was a bestseller or not for nearly 70% of cases. This is 40% better than random guesswork. It is far from perfect but given the nature

Judging Books by Their Covers

 95

of the data and the way tastes change 70% accuracy is surprisingly good." They missed The Da Vinci Code and Harry Potter. Still, what does Moretti have to say about this sort of thing? (I don't mean to be insulting, suggesting Moretti has never considered that people read after they buy, that there is such a thing as marketing, etc. I just wonder what he has to say about it.) And yes, obviously my two-stage process is not tidy. Your book needs to be consistently selected to get read. This isn't just a matter of an eye-catchy cover, or snappy title. It's also a matter of getting an editor to read you, then select you for prominent placement to be read by many others. It's a matter of opinion-formers--`coolhunters', first adopters, reviewers, literary cliques, what shelf it gets shelved on, what genre tag gets attached to it, what authors become `brand names'. Oprah. Most of this activity indeed has to do with books actually being read, and winning the `ruthless competition' to some degree as Moretti supposes: editors, reviewers, early adopters, Oprah, have to like the form of your book (it's got clues!) Still, in laying stress on the morphology of what's between the covers, Moretti risks assuming efficiency in the diffusion of information about morphology. We have an efficient literary market hypothesis. I don't see a strong reason for believing in this efficiency. And be it noted: the evolutionary analogies may still pan out, even if my skepticism is warranted (so we are not really arguing about whether we should go on talking about evolution, or the market-place.) I might seem to be saying: you can judge a book by its cover, and we do. But natural selection is not such an idle browser: you can't judge, um, a beetle by its carapace. Ergo, I am distinguishing the lazy reading styles/ purchasing practices of humans from Mother Nature's more rigorous critical practices. But this is wrong. You can judge a beetle by its cover: red means poison (keep away!) Covers are

96 

John Holbo

as adaptive in nature, red in tooth and claw, as on the bookrack, red in ripped bodices and teeth and claws and other popular offerings. And for similar reasons. It is often advantageous to convey a strong sense of what's inside. At this point, let me turn to the luck argument. Moretti responds to Tim Burke: It is certainly possible that dumb luck plays/played a much larger role than we imagine--probably larger and larger as we move back in history, and cultural products can disappear more easily. I will enlarge on this in my reply to Prendergast, but I may as well admit right away that every time I have studied competition, success, and failure, I have never found that luck played a major role (the only one exception I know: Austen's novels, despite having soldiers, include no reference to war, unlike most of her contemporaries, and the so-called "Hundred Years' Peace" that begun in 1815 rewarded her enormously for her choice: sheer external luck changing the world, and hence the expectations of generations of readers.) (Needless to say, this is not the only ingredient in Austen's long-term success). But I admire Gould too, and would have liked to find instances of dumb luck. If anyone comes up with convincing examples, I'd love to see them.

Rather than pretend to some dataset at my fingertips [see postscript for the dataset that turned up later] let me dogmatically opine that J.K. Rowling is lucky. She's good, not that good. At some point something tipped. Her books came to occupy an oddly favorable position, which cascaded into favor upon favor. Straining a bit, you might say that what you have here is mild cultural `lock-in', on the model of the `lockin' Microsoft has enjoyed--except that everyone likes Harry.

Judging Books by Their Covers

 97

Harry Potter is a cultural operating system unto himself. People read Harry because otherwise they wouldn't know what's going on when everyone else is talking about Harry. There are social benefits to reading Harry and social costs of not doing so, for people who are not otherwise plugged into any systems of literary reputation (snobbish or sensitive or otherwise). And don't forget plain old-fashioned brand name recognition. But it could have been a different author whose works lucked into that role. Or, more likely, no author. (Who thinks it was necessary that any literary success on this scale was inevitably emergent at just this juncture in history?) A large thesis, yes. But significant because, in denying `luck' in the study of "competition, success, and failure" Moretti seems committed to denying the possibility of things we know happen in, say, business. (Don't we?) It seems to me obvious that Rowling is not a unique case, merely an extreme one. Many authors occupy cultural niches that others might occupy but don't happen to. On the other hand, is it right to call this `luck'? Rowling is a lucky woman. But `dumb luck' may suggest there is no rational explanation, which is something else. This gets us back to Burke:
But as for how Doyle's stories set the conventions of a genre and others die, are forgotten, wither, some of that might be simply termed "dumb luck," that the precise location at which crystallization of a genre occurs in a moment where many nascent forms of the genre are present is about the accidents of readership, of circulation, of publication, of imitation, that there is no deeper explanation that needs to cite how Doyle's particular formulation of the genre more precisely satisfied or represented the desires of a reading public, or how his ability as a writer was more precisely distinguished from any other. I'm echoing Gould's Wonderful Life here very consciously.

98 

John Holbo

Which is it? No explanation? Or we can't know it? (Because it's unreconstructable, or just wouldn't exhibit enough interest?) I push the point because it seems plausible that the explanation in Doyle's case might be that Holmes got famous through a series of lucky breaks (such as Tim Burke is thinking of ); yet these breaks can only be understood with reference to certain `morphological' features, in Moretti's sense. Chance favors the prepared meme. Postscript When I wrote the original version of this piece, in 2006, there was indeed (to my knowledge) no dataset to test any form of the `lucky break' hypothesis in rigorous fashion. If you pressed reset, then let it play out again, would Harry Potter come out on top again? Alas, the actual world lacks a reset button (or perhaps that's a good thing, at least for nonscientific purposes; but scientifically inconvenient.) But in 2007, just such a data set was ingeniously collected. Experimenters at Columbia University--Matthew Salganik, Peter Dodds, and Duncan Watts--set up MusicLab, an online environment consisting of `worlds' in which participants rate and download songs by (unknown) bands. The experimenters constructed `independent' and `social influence' worlds. In the former, participants could see only song titles and band names (randomly ordered); in social influence worlds songs were ranked according to participants' ratings (1 to 5 stars) and download counts were visible as well. In two social influence worlds, this social information was falsified--inverted, to be exact. The highest-rated song appeared to be the lowestrated, and vice versa. As the title of a paper by the experimenters suggests-- "Leading the Herd Astray: An Experimental Study of Selffulfilling Prophecies in an Artificial Cultural Market"--the

Judging Books by Their Covers

 99

experiment was devised to test not Moretti's hypothesis but its approximate opposite: namely, the notion that social influence is all. So, for example, a song falsely identified as popular will become popular--self-fulfilling prophecy. Obviously, Moretti's skepticism about the role of luck is likewise testable in such an environment. (I acknowledge that Moretti is not dogmatic in his claims about the role of luck, so it would not be fair to say his view is falsifiable by such an experiment. Still, he clearly has strong personal opinions that may--and will-- be challenged by the likes of MusicLab.) A quick note: it is misleading to continue using terms like `luck' and `chance'. We are actually talking about forms of social influence. Let's review how we've gotten a bit off-track: even if it is luck in the Harry Potter case, in the sense that no one has any story to tell about an ingenious marketing scheme that seeded the famous series' popularity, it certainly is not the case that all advantageous social/cultural positioning/influence is due to luck. What I am thinking about, when I talk `luck' in my piece, is mostly the power of path dependence; of initial advantage (due to chance or any other source, social or otherwise) cascading to dramatic effect. This is what Robert Merton calls (and Malcolm Gladwell has popularized as) `the Matthew effect': "for unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath" (25:29). It is also the Paris Hilton effect: famous for being famous. Initial advantage--small thing--can be sheer luck. Something snowballed for Harry Potter, then a self-reinforcing social-influence feedback loop got established (plausibly). But the fact that what seeded Harry's snowball, initially, may have been some snowflake of dumb luck is not essential to the shape of the question, or to the discovery of any answer. So what does the answer turn out to be, insofar as the Music Lab experiment discovers any?

100 

John Holbo

Unsurprisingly (I would say) the pure, self-fulfilling prophecy hypothesis is not borne out. Neither is any pure quality-will-out hypothesis, however (without which the proposition that luck is not a significant factor earns a serious question mark.) Moretti would be gratified to learn that the top quality song in the independent world also reached the top in the basic social influence world; and, even when falsely accused of being low quality in inverted social influence worlds, was on-track to regain its top spot (although the experiment ended before this result was attained, if ever it would have been.) But the number two song's standing was not similarly immune to social influence and manipulation. In general, there was a great deal of variation, across worlds, pointing to the power of social influence, also to the power of path dependence. Small things, early on, make a big difference in the end. So luck does end up playing a big role. These worlds, despite being identical at the level of the features of the aesthetic objects they contain, diverge significantly. And, frankly, it would be incredible if, in the real world, these effects were less, rather than more, than in this toy experimental environment. (The interested reader should review the experimenters' own conclusions, and their more quantitatively precise statements of their results.) What lesson should Moretti take from this? He is not refuted, since (to repeat) he does not commit himself categorically to any specific, falsifiable proposition about the non-role of luck (or social influence); but he should be a bit chastened. "I may as well admit right away that every time I have studied competition, success, and failure, I have never found that luck played a major role." This may be true, as a report of personal experience But it will not do. Moretti's mindset seems to be this: he can see a potential variable he cannot see how to control for. He is, in effect, hoping he can

Judging Books by Their Covers

 101

do without controlling it. Unfortunately, it does not seem he can really be right. On the other hand, it hardly seems impossible to envision (very empirically ambitious, to be sure) attempts to study the sorts of things Moretti studies and the sorts of things the MusicLab experimenters study; the two approaches really ought to be complementary, even if they do challenge each other's assumptions at points. Consider this. The Music Lab experimenters' incidental reflections on the nature of aesthetic quality do not mar their social psychological experimental designs, nor do they invalidate their reasoning to various conclusions. Still, their reflections are so innocent I cannot help suspecting tongues in cheeks (at least I hope they are, a little bit):
An obvious explanation for the failure of the inversion to lock in [i.e. popular songs falsely identified as unpopular recover their rank somewhat, and unpopular songs false identified and popular sink down in the ranks somewhat] is that the songs themselves were of different quality, and that these differences were more salient than the perception of popularity. Previous theoretical work by economists has indeed emphasized the importance of intrinsic quality on outcomes (Rosen 1981), and attempts have been made to measure the quality of cultural products (Hamlen Jr. 1991; Krueger 2005). Unfortunately, no generally agreed upon measure of quality exists, in large part because quality is largely, if not completely, a social construction (Gans 1974; Becker 1982; Bourdieu 1984; DiMaggio 1987; Cutting 2003; Frith 2004). (Salganik, Watts, 349)

I do not think it was necessary for these authors, in this particular paper, to survey the history of ideas about art, cul-

102 

John Holbo

ture, aesthetic judgment, and critical consensus. But, having decided to go down that line, it was incumbent on them to go further; to take note that the literature stretches back before 1981, to say the least, and beyond the economics department. History of aesthetics and art criticism, anyone? (David Hume, at least? Adam Smith read him, after all.) Also, the proposition that `quality is largely, if not completely, a social construction'--is simply not the sort of thing one can assume, or even claim as weakly supported by any existing body of data. Not because there is evidence it is false, merely because the claim is ambiguous and vague. We don't know what is being claimed. But the truth concerning the area being blanketed by this claim is quite important, potentially. At least it is interesting. Before I take another step, let me say that I may be about to protest too much: I don't think that anyone proposing Moretti-esque studies, regarding music (or any other cultural products), would in fact be unreasonably dismissed by the MusicLab experimenters. If someone proposed investigating features of the songs from the MusicLab experiment set; if investigators found relations or connections, intriguing patterns, I am sure the MusicLab experimenters would be quick enough to see this line might be worthwhile. Nevertheless, this `socially constructed' line has a tendency to plow through the interest of what Moretti does in conceptually incoherent fashion. Let me try to clear that up. (Even if the confusion would not cause trouble, in practice--which it might not--it will be nice to have some theoretical sense of how projects like Moretti's, and these MusicLab investigators, might interlock, conceptually.) The MusicLab experimenters are tending to assume that value can only be measured as a function of preference; preference is a feature of audiences, not art works. This might make it seem that you can only study value (in this sense) by

Judging Books by Their Covers

 103

studying audiences, as opposed to art works, which is pretty much what MusicLab does. (For experimental purposes, the songs in their set might as well be black boxes.) But, in a sense, this is just false: many musicological features whose relations to MusicLab results might be worth investigation (length, beats-per-minute, instrumentation, even style) are non-socially constructed, on any plausible account of what `social-constructed' means. (Even style? You can't make something a sonata just by saying it is one. It has to have the right features.) You can study all that, how various features song features are correlated with other features, how all that is correlated with preferences and also perhaps how it is correlated with susceptibility to or immunity to social influence. (I'm not saying I know there would be interesting results. But it would be perfectly possible to check for them, empirically.) Even if `fast songs are good songs' is only true in the sense that a solid democratic bloc reports that it likes fast songs (which begs the question against certain competing accounts of `value', no doubt, but that is fine so long as you are clear about it); still, studying aesthetic values, in this subjectivist sense, does not entail the exclusive study of subjects, as opposed to works; because beats per minute is not a matter of what anyone thinks, let alone what anyone prefers. So: you look to preferences to see which properties of a song are interesting, for aesthetic study purposes. (It turns out that tempo is important. Surely this will be the case.) But then the properties that show up as valuable (or as correlated with values, if you are absolutely insistent on keeping value in the eye of the beholder) really are properties of the song. They can be investigated to a considerable extent quite independently of anything except the songs themselves. Again, I doubt anyone would really make this mistake in practice. But these authors may do so in theory, so it's worth pointing out where the fallacy slips in.

104 

John Holbo

Let's shift, hypothetically, to MysteryLab, where Moretti has run fresh experiments. There isn't much point in me making up results, although I feel confident that they would not be so different from the MusicLab results. Pace Moretti, social influence and chance would play a significant role. (Until someone does it, of course, Moretti--and you, too--are free to keep whatever faith about the role of luck that you like.) I would emphasize only that it is obviously not necessary to treat art objects themselves as black boxes, as it were, for purposes of experimental design. It is not even too late, in the MusicLab case, to undertake a Morettiesque study of the features of the works themselves. The songs still exist, from which you could generate data about song features. It would be interesting to see what emerged, I think.

 Moretti Responds (III)
franco moretti

First, public thanks to Bob O'Hara--years ago I read his "Homage to Clio," and it helped me think about evolution and historiography. I have started reading some more of his work this morning, and look forward to the rest. Tim Burke's new version of the `dumb luck' idea makes much more sense to me, especially in John Holbo's version that "luck favors the prepared meme." Here, a morphological tree allows to recapture, not the luck exactly, but at least the initial proximity between the winner and the rivals--a proximity that market mechanisms quickly magnify into a galactic gap. In this sense, there is a continuity between the morphological argument (that establishes the--often tiny-- difference in initial conditions) and the social one (that explores the path dependency created by, in our case, literary markets). Going back to the issue of luck, every lock-in is a piece of luck [Doyle may have deserved to fare better, but not that much better!] But if the mechanism behind "social" luck is known (it a feedback loop, as Arthur and others have shown), it remains to be seen what is the mechanism behind "morphological" luck. Steven Johnson's question--How is the reader influenced by formal properties without being fully conscious of the influence?--is similar to Bill Benzon's "how is it that the world makes its way into the mind there to be transformed
 105

Franco Moretti

into texts?" Once more, I wish I knew an answer. What I did in the book was to leave a black box in the explanatory chain: given how the text is made, and given the success decreed by its readers, there must be a passage in between where certain formal properties are perceived by those who are reading, even though we have no actual evidence that the latter are aware of them. "There must be": that's the black box. One should open it up, and explain how it works. When I will start studying a solution, I think I'll follow Steven's advice, and assume that the cognitive sciences will be more relevant than evolutionary psychology. Jenny Davidson finds the project "Pied-Piper-esque," because too dependent on my own knowledge: without which, she writes, "doesn't the soul go out of the whole enterprise?" Thanks for the kind words, but if you remove the person who has done most of the work, doesn't the soul go out of any enterprise? Sociological coda. As for my having at my disposal "the human-graduate-student-equivalent of a commodity-cluster supercomputer," not to mention the hints by John Emerson about grad students voting en bloc at the MLA--I have been teaching in the US for 15 years, and have never been a member of the MLA, so that's unlikely. As for grad students doing the primary work on which I later build castles in the air, this has happened a few times--but much more often in the opposite direction, with me gathering the primary data, and placing them at the disposal of students or readers. [Incidentally, it's amazing how few people are willing to work on data that you have collected. Don't ask me why.] Grad students are in general wary of projects like Graphs, Maps, Trees. They realize they are very time-consuming, as one may work for weeks gathering data that reveal nothing. In my situation, I can afford the waste [although I hate it], but they can't. And then, they are a lot less sure than some contributors to The

Moretti Responds (III)

Valve that this will be a significant trend in literary studies. Conclusion: of the many students who work with me only one in five, maybe one in ten, works along the lines of my last book. Professionally, this is bad for me [my research needs more data, gathered by different minds, etc]. leaves my students and myself with our own paths and intellectual personalities.

 A Few Quibbles about Moretti's Graphs, Maps, Trees
Sean McCann
I love Graphs, Maps, and Trees. Who couldn't? If you're not dazzled by the erudition and the data set, how could you fail to find instruction and delight in the nimbleness of Moretti's mind and the brio of his prose? But, love it though I do, like Matt, Ray, and Jenny Davidson, I'm not so sure that GMT can really "delineate a transformation in the study of literature" as Moretti suggests (NLR 67). (On the "Maps" technique, let me recommend another superb precursor, Carlo Rotella's October Cities.) I applaud Moretti's remarkable commitment to research. I admire his interest in "explanation" as against "interpretation" (even if I'm not sure the distinction finally holds up). I'm attracted to his emphasis on "devices and genres; not texts." And I welcome his enthusiasm for analogies and examples drawn from all sorts of disciplines arguably related to literary scholarship. I'm still more taken by his intellectual seriousness and his evident appreciation for the artfulness of literary creativity. But looking at the essays in combination and considering some of the many different sources of insight I think they combine, I don't see a new methodology for literary study so much as a sterling example of comparative literary scholarship at its most inspired--à la Auerbach, Spitzer, Bakhtin. Here's an unscientific prediction. There will be no school of Moretti, because only Moretti will prove able to do what's on display here. A few minor thoughts about why that might be so.

First of all, I think it should be noted that, fruitful though it clearly is, the "quantitative" angle could easily become misleading. It's wonderful to see the graphs and to get a sense of the vast range of material that still needs to be discovered and understood. But as Moretti notes ("Graphs" 72), all this is just data until hypotheses are generated. And it's in the hypotheses (produced, by the way, via "interpretation") that Moretti's most serious commitments and their potential limits standout. The real interest, as Moretti indicates throughout, is not so much in quantification as in the end it serves-- "comparative morphology" ("Trees" 62). The central argument of the three essays, as I read them, is that literary form is a record of (highly various) forces that can be discovered by the scrupulous reader (102). Among the places, Moretti puts this most clearly is a passage in "Maps." It deserves to be, I think, a stunner of a line:
Deducing from the form of the object, the forces that have been at work: this is the most elegant definition ever of what literary sociology should be. (97)

Perhaps I'm over-reading, but "deducing" brought me up short. I would have said that one fundamental implication of Moretti's research program is that it should hold out little hope for deducing at all. If you're gathering information on the publication history of the novel, then presumably there is no object to investigate, only (to use the evolutionary terminology Moretti introduces) population groups. And, if I understand correctly, short of molecular biology, the only way to understand population groups is via induction. With the history of publishing and reading, too, that induction should arguably range over a pretty wide span of territory--including (to take up some points mentioned by Timothy Burke

110 

Sean McCann

and John Holbo) whatever can be gathered about readers, industries, markets, mediators, and institutions. Moretti leaves most of that material aside here, along with some of the existing scholarship (genre theory, as Matt notes, but also, e.g., publishing and literacy history) that emphasizes different factors than he places at the fore. In other words, it's not only pedantry to pause at the deduction thing. As he was in the exhilarating early essays collected in Signs Taken for Wonders, Moretti remains form-centric. And, while he makes that approach highly rewarding indeed, it rests on some basic assumptions whose unargued status (and, perhaps, inconsistencies) leave GMT less a portent of a new approach to cultural history than a brilliant example of literary criticism at its best.
1) The most striking of those assumptions, indicated in "Graphs," is the notion adopted from Russian formalism that literary genres function to "represent the most significant aspects of contemporary reality" (77, n.8). Combining Shklovsky with Kuhn, Moretti suggests that genres resemble scientific paradigms and organize the perception of reality in productive but inevitably limited ways. I find this an intuitively appealing notion, but I think you've got to acknowledge that it remains unproven and probably unprovable. It's not hard, for example, to consider other possible functions served by genres--preserving the shared values of a culture, say, or providing entertainment value. Could such functions be consistent with the representation of "reality"? Quite possibly, but it can take some creative interpretation to make the case. (Why did the movie musical flourish and decline? Was it really the genre's ability to represent reality?)

Human, Not So Human

 111

2) That first assumption, which reads form as a way to organize the perception of reality sits alongside a second assumption, with which it may be, but I think isn't necessarily consistent. This is the view expressed in the Conan Doyle section of "Trees" that sees the diversity, success, and failure of literary forms as the product of market selection. The selecting agent here, of course, is not the pressure of changing historical reality itself, but the preferences of a popular readership. (It's possible to argue, of course, that readers will select for forms that represent reality well, but that doesn't follow inevitably.) 3) Finally, the emphasis on reader selection runs up against the claim in the latter part of "Trees," with its fascinating discussion of free indirect discourse, that history and social geography determine the use of literary techniques--a suggestion that more closely resembles the assumption noted in "Graphs."

Although I think it interferes with some of the elegance of Moretti's argument, I also believe that it's a very good thing that the latter part of "Trees" reintroduces the emphasis on social geography emphasized by "Maps." Otherwise, the discussion of Conan Doyle could be taken to imply that Moretti's method depends on a unidimensional model of the literary market. Discussing the rise of the detective story, Moretti suggests that what survives is just what worked and what readers liked--so that the sale of pop fiction appears to function as something like an efficient market. ("What the literary market is like: literary competition--hinging on form. Readers discover that they like a certain device, and if a story doesn't seem to include it, they simply don't read it (and the story becomes extinct)" (48).) But, striking though this particular case study is, that impression will probably only

112 

Sean McCann

work with a fairly narrow example--and one where low-cost entertainment lit is at the fore. With cheap, mass circulation entertainment, it makes sense to assume that consumer preference probably shapes the production and popularity of literary fashion most directly. Needless to say, however, not all literature is only a consumer good. Just to choose some minor complications, some of it also serves pedagogical, ideological, and status purposes. And those complications on the reception side are mirrored on the production side. Moretti quickly considers and dismisses (with one striking, but still quite limited piece of data) the role of status in influencing the chances of literary success. But surely the status battles of artists are a major engine of modern creativity, and the success they crave is not only secured by readership in numbers. Of course, Moretti doesn't need to take the full range of these complications into account in order to have fascinating things to say. But I think they cast some doubt on the analogy of literary scholarship to scientific research. One further example. Toward the end of "Trees" Moretti emphasizes the "the dependence of morphological novelty on spatial discontinuity," drawing an implicit analogy to evolutionary speciation (62). But, if I understand right, the essay combines two, not necessarily fully overlapping senses of environment: the market in which products compete for reader attention (emphasized in the discussion of Doyle); and the social world they claim to represent (emphasized in the discussion of free indirect discourse). Especially when Moretti discusses Gabriel Garcia Márquez--surely a world novelist with an international market by the time he wrote Patriarch--it seems clear that these two kinds of environment differ and don't necessarily overlap. Only the first really works with the evolutionary analogy. Personally, I won't be much disappointed if literary scholarship never really resembles scientific investigation. I

Human, Not So Human

 113

wish we all were as good as Moretti and shared his seriousness and creativity. But I'm not sure a more rational form of literary history is needed. At one point in "Trees" Moretti makes a rather striking comment about one reason why he thinks otherwise. The comment comes in the course of Moretti's disagreement with Alfred Kroeber about whether the evolution of biological species differs from the evolution of cultural forms. Kroeber thinks there is a fundamental difference and that it's evident in the convergence, as well as divergence, of cultural forms. Moretti disagrees and raises the stakes, saying "the real content of the controversy, not technical at all, is our very idea of culture." If we stress divergence:
then cultural history is bound to be random, full of false starts, and profoundly path dependent.... If, on the other hand, the basic mechanism is that of convergence, change will be frequent, fast, deliberate, reversible: culture becomes more plastic, more human if you wish. But as human history is seldom so human, this is perhaps not the strongest of arguments. (55-56)

Perhaps not. But that last witticism isn't much of an argument either and, if I understand correctly, doesn't really address Kroeber's contention at all. (Pointing out the human agency in unnatural selection doesn't necessarily imply a belief that history is humane.) More seriously, aren't we posed with a false choice here? I'm way out of my depth with this stuff, but I would have thought that, if we take the analogy to evolutionary biology seriously, then neither convergence nor divergence would count as a "basic mechanism." Wouldn't both merely be the effects of random variation and selection? If that's so, Moretti presents us with a needless conflict, and one that suggests that a part of the motivation for his transformation of literary study may be the long-standing de-

114

sire to purge culture of its humanist legacies. I'm sympathetic to that goal in part, but I don't think it's really required for a meaningful cultural history.

A few years ago, I wrote a review of Moretti's Atlas of the European Novel, in which I presumed to tell him how to go about his business. When he ran across it, his reaction was not (as mine would've been, had our situation been reversed) to tell me where to get off, but to invite me to a workshop he was organizing at Stanford on new interdisciplinary work on the novel--its motto, the quotation from Brecht about "questions that appear to us completely unsolved," is recycled for this book --where I had a great time. Reading these essays as they came out in New Left Review, I enjoyed them intensely, and recall thinking that Moretti could hardly have done a better job of appealing to my prejudices if he'd tried. (Said prejudices are those of someone almost equally fond of The Extended Phenotype and Main Currents of Marxism.) With this kind of background, it comes as no surprise, I trust, that I really like this book, and find objecting to what he actually proposes here highly wrong-headed. In what follows, I want to say a bit about "graphs" and a bit about "trees," and explain why this sounds so promising to me. I am not going to say anything about "maps," because I don't think I have anything to add to that discussion, but I will, for the sake of getting an M in there, end with some remarks on "materialism." At no point can I pretend to be competent to evaluate the originality of Moretti's work within literary scholarship, to say how much of a departure, say, the trees really are. In a feeble attempt to pretend that my price is higher

than a weekend in California and a review copy, I will make some criticisms, most about tedious extra stuff I wish Moretti had also done. I'd like to think that what I say will also have some value for those who don't share my rather haphazard intellectual trajectory, but my experience with trying to communicate across disciplines means I'll get a warm glow if I'm even comprehensible, never mind persuasive. I am accordingly very grateful to the Valve, and especially to Jonathan Goodwin, for letting someone with my credentials (viz., none) participate in this event. GRAPHS Do Genres Come in Bunches? Moretti makes a very striking claim in his first chapter: that genres of novels appear together, in clusters, separated by about 25 years, and disappear together too. Looking at his graph, my eye agrees, but my eye also tells me that there are faces in clouds (the East African Plains Ape is an incorrigible pattern-finder), and probability theory tells me that purely random processes can produce a lot of apparent clustering and regularity. What reason is there to think that what looks like genres coming in clusters isn't just coincidence? Let's be a little more precise about what we'd mean by "chance" and "coincidence" here. One natural possibility is that new genres appear at a constant rate over time, utterly independently of one another. Every year, then, there would be a constant probability of a new genre forming, but whether it did or not would have no bearing on whether the next year saw a new genre. This is our null model--the one that says what things should look like if we're just fooling ourselves, and there are no clusters. To get slightly technical, the intervals between genre-arrivals should have what's called a geometric distribution. Assuming, for the sake of argument,

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 117

that that's true, we can use the average time between genreappearances (3.44 years) to estimate the most likely value for the probability of a new genre appearing in any given year (about 29%). Once we assume that the inter-arrival distribution is geometric and find the parameter, we can simulate from it, and get examples of what Moretti's graph would look like, if only chance were at play.

The top line shows the appearance dates of Moretti's 44 genres; the next two lines give the results of simulating from a model of uniform random appearance, with the same mean time between genres as the actual history. Is there more clustering in reality than in the results of the null model? I couldn't say, by eye, but I don't have to. I can calculate the probability of generating Moretti's history from the null model: it's somewhat less than 1 in 1045. This in itself isn't decisive; any particular history becomes less and less probable as one considers longer and longer intervals of time (cue Stoppard), so we need to know what fraction of all

118 

Cosma Shalizi

histories of that length are at least that unlikely. I could work this out exactly, if I were willing to do some actual math, but I'm lazy, so I just had the computer simulate a million histories and evaluated all of their likelihoods. If the null model were actually true, we'd see histories like Moretti's only about 0.4% percent of the time.1 So this is actually pretty good evidence that the null model is not true, and Moretti's history does show the kind of clustering he thinks it does. Of course, this only underlines the question of why Moretti's data is clustered. I can think of a couple of deflating explanations (maybe the clusters match the periods more intensely scrutinized by historians; maybe they tend to adjust when they report genres appearing towards certain focal dates). Or it could be due to some sort of exogenous influence, from war, politics, economic shifts, etc. (I did not try removing the obviously topical genres, like Chartist novels, and repeating the analysis.) Or it could be due to some sort of endogenous mechanism within the system of literary production and consumption--generational turn-over of authors, of readers, of editors and publishers (suggested by my friend Bill Tozier). Or: maybe there's some space of things-people-like-in-novels, which the popular genres at any one time partition up in various ways; if one genre dies out or another appears, this might destabilize all the others as well. I don't think Moretti's time series, by itself, is enough to begin to let us decide among these mechanisms (some of which are compatible), but I do think it lets us see that some mechanism is called for. Here is my first reproach: Moretti should have been the one to do this analysis, not me. If testing hypotheses is too banausic and mechanical for the pages of New Left Review, then it should either be in another article, or in the book. Moretti is a shrewd man, and in this case his intuitive analysis of the data was right, but there is no reason to rely on intu-

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 119

ition alone for something like this. And, if one is going to go to the trouble to collect quantitative data, one ought to use it quantitatively. Mathematical abstraction (quantitative or otherwise) is not valuable for its own sake, but for the inferences it lets us make, when the proper tools are applied. In this case, those tools are pretty easy to bring to bear. They should be. Dissolving Genre History Here is Moretti at the end of "Graphs":
For most literary historians ... there is a categorical difference between `the novel' and the various `novelistic (sub)genres': the novel is, so to speak, the substance of the form, and deserves a full general theory; subgenres are more like accidents, and their study, however interesting, remains local in character, without real theoretical consequences. The fortyfour genres of figure 9, however, suggest a different historical picture, where the novel does not develop as a single entity--where is `the' novel, there?--but by periodically generating a whole set of genres, and then another, and another... Both synchronically and diachronically, in other words, the novel is the system of its genres: the whole diagram, not one privileged part of it. Some genres are morphologically more significant, of course, or more popular, or both--and we must account for this: but not by pretending that they are the only ones that exist. And instead, all great theories of the novel have precisely reduced the novel to one basic form only (realism, the dialogic, romance, meta-novels...); and if the reduction has given them their elegance and power, it has also erased nine tenths of literary history. Too much. (90)

120 

Cosma Shalizi

On the one hand, this seems to me to be obviously correct. On the other hand, I wonder very much why Moretti stops here. If we look within any one of those forty-four genres, I think we have every reason to suppose that we'd find it composed, in its turn, of sub-genres, and so on, and ultimately of a shifting succession of individual texts. 'The' Bildungsroman (to pick one of the forty-four, not entirely at random) is a short-hand way of referring to the most common and enduring features of a historically-changing and always-various population of books, just as "the" bottle-nosed dolphin is an abbreviation for the leading tendencies of a certain population of organisms. What Moretti hints at, in the paragraph I quoted, is that "the" novel is itself a population, either of genres, or of texts structured into genres. But he doesn't say outright what seems very plain to me, and so I'd like to know why, and specifically whether he thinks it's actually wrong, or unhelpful.
The assumptions of population thinking are diametrically opposed to those of the typologist. The populationist stresses the uniqueness of everything in the organic world. What is true for the human species--that no two individuals are alike--is equally true for all other species of animals and plants. Indeed, even the same individual changes continuously throughout its lifetime and when placed into different environments. All organisms and organic phenomena are composed of unique features and can be described collectively only in statistical terms. Individuals, or any kind of organic entities, form populations of which we can determine the arithmetic mean and the statistics of variation. Averages are merely statistical abstractions, only the individuals of which the populations are composed have reality. The ultimate conclusions of the population thinker

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 121

and of the typologist are precisely the opposite. For the typologist, the type (eidos) is real and the variation an illusion, while for the populationist the type (average) is an abstraction and only the variation is real. (Mayr, 84, quoting himself from a 1959 paper)

This makes salient the question of how we mark off different populations as distinct. The usual biological criterion is through common descent, and the possibility of interbreeding---Mayr's "biological species concept." (There is a vast controversial literature on the details.) Ruth Garrett Millikan has a closely related notion of "reproductively-established families," which doesn't lean so heavily on the details of biology, and which would seem to fit the case of genres of novels (Millikan, 1984). One could also define classes of texts purely morphologically, which might include many unrelated lineages (just as one might consider all streamlined marine predators which live in the water all the time, a class including dolphins, killer whales, sharks, tuna, ichthyosaurs, etc.). Just as such organic forms have appeared in several lineages, morphologically-defined categories could appear in multiple places and periods, the way novels arose, apparently quite independently, in both the Hellenistic world and in China (and elsewhere, for all I know). Historical populations, however, are unique. TREES
One could ... take evolutionary bibliography as the prototypical evolutionary science and think of biology in terms of bibliographic analogies...2

The Cabinet of Horrors People have generally sought to explain cultural change and cultural variation by supposing that culture is causally driven

122 

Cosma Shalizi

by something else (the climate, the social structure), or, more strongly, that it is adapted to something else, or, more strongly yet, that it functions adaptively for the benefit of something else (here social structure, or ruling classes, are favored as suspects over the climate). This has led to an awful lot of (if I may use the phrase) adaptationist just-so stories, and uncritical analogy-mongering on a level with the sort of thinking which leads rhinoceros horn to be prescribed for impotence. Jon Elster is worth quoting at some length:
In his comments on the links among capitalism, Protestantism, and Catholicism Marx set a disastrous precedent for many later writers who have attempted to find "structural homologies" or "isomorphisms" (two fancy terms for "similarities") between economic structures and mental products. Because virtually any two entities can be said to resemble each other in some respect, this practice has no constraints other than the inventiveness of and ingenuity of the writer: There are no reality constraints and no reality control. Marx suggests two inconsistent lines of argument. One is that there is a strong connection between mercantilism and Protestantism, the other that there is an elective affinity between mercantilism and Catholicism. He was confused, apparently, by the fact that money has two distinct features that point to different religious modes. On the one hand, money (gold and silver), unlike credit, can be hoarded. Hoarding easily turns into an obsession, which is related to the fanatical self-denying practices of extreme Protestantism. On the other hand, money can be seen as the "incarnation" or "transubstantiation" of real wealth. In that sense the money fetishism associated with mercantilism is related to the specifically Catholic practice of investing relics and the like with supernatural significance. Both arguments are

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 123

asserted several times by Marx, each serving to show up the essential arbitrariness of the other. Later attempts to explain the theology of Port Royal, the philosophy of Descartes, or the physics of Newton in terms of similarities with the underlying economic structure are equally arbitrary. Like the analogies between societies and organisms that flourished around the turn of the century, they belong to the cabinet of horrors of scientific thought. Their common ancestor is the theory of "signs" that flourished in the century prior to the scientific revolution inaugurated by Galileo--the idea that there are natural, noncausal correspondences between different parts of the universe. What Keith Thomas refers to as the "short-lived union of science and magic" maintained a subterranean existence of which the doctrine of ideology, in one of its versions, has been one manifestation. (Elster, 183-184)

Even if we shutter and lock the Cabinet of Horrors, and go to look for explanations of trends in such cultural products as novels (which is, after all, what Moretti wants), I'm afraid we will find most of them in the capacious Closet of Mildly Appalling Objects. There is no shortage of attempts to give such changes meaning as signs of something else, some aspect of the social or economic structure, of the way we live now (or the way they lived then), but very, very few of them are convincing. In his great book on changing fashions, A Matter of Taste, the sociologist Stanley Lieberson looks at some of the reasons why these attempts at ad hoc explanation are so often bad. (He puts things more politely; I paraphrase.) First, the facts are often just screwy, both about the developments to be explained: non-existent trends, non-existent causes, weirdly mis-characterized trends, trends being explained by events which happened long after the former began, etc. (In fairness,

124 

Cosma Shalizi

such scholarly "misconstruction of reality"--à la Hamilton (1996)--is a lot more common than we academics like to think.) Second, the mechanism connecting the explanations to the explananda is left totally obscure. Third, no attempt is made to test the explanation, by checking that it can account for the magnitude of the observed change, by ruling out alternative explanations, or by much of anything else. The result is a steady stream of claims about how culture works which are advanced with what is, under the circumstances, an astonishing degree of assurance. Lieberson's book provides many fine examples of such cavalier just-so story-telling for names, the decline of hats, etc.3 Checking hypotheses about causation, and still more about adaptation, is really hard; with just one case, arguably hopeless. What you need is the ability to reliably detect departures from the hypothesis, if they are actually present-- "power," in the statisticians' jargon. It is hard to get much power when n=1. If you want to claim that certain aspects of 19th century British novels were the way they were because those features fitted with ideologies of British imperialism-- a fairly strong hypothesis about adaptation--I don't see how you can do it just by interpreting Mansfield Park, no matter how subtle and sophisticated your reading. On the other hand, if you look at lots of contemporary novels, and the ones which (say) depict Great Britain's relations with its colonies in the same way as Mansfield Park does are systematically more successful, on average, than those which depict it differently, well then I don't see how that couldn't be good news for your idea, though even that would really only be the beginning of backing it up. Biologists have given a lot of thought to checking hypotheses about adaptation, and developed many means of doing so. Mutatis mutandis, many of these means could also be applied to literature, or other aspects of culture. Eric Rabkin,

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 125

Carl Simon and their collaborators have started doing just this with their Genre Evolution Project, looking at short stories from 20th century American science fiction, and no doubt there are others doing this kind of thing too. One way of checking adaptive hypotheses, especially relevant here, is the "comparative method," or rather methods, which work much, much better when combined with good phylogenies. I think a literary historian who wants to study the evolution of genres and devices would be very well advised to look at the comparative methods biologists employ to study the evolution of qualitative characteristics of organisms. (The major issue would be that literary phylogenies will not be trees but more complicated lattices. But this is analogous to the effects of lateral gene transfer, common among bacteria, and so I'd suspect not only solvable but solved, someplace in the literature. Whether inheritance is by means of discrete-valued, particulate factors, i.e., genes, is not a crucial issue for such methods.) What I really want to see from Moretti (or someone) is a study along these lines of clues in the detective story; I'd be even more interested in one of free indirect discourse. A crucial aspect of testing hypothesis about adaptation is a contrast with the outcome of a well-crafted neutral model-- a way of saying what to expect if no adaptation were present, or not that adaptation anyway. These often have surprising consequences; for instance, neutral genetic drift will tend to fix some version of a gene in a given population, even if it confers no fitness advantage. (This is described in any book on population genetics.) So I wonder about things like whether we should expect, under a reasonable neutral model, that some formal device should become universal within a genre? If so, did clues take over detective stories any faster than neutrality would predict? (It's hard to imagine a successful genre where every story relies on confessions found by accident, but

126 

Cosma Shalizi

whether that's intrinsically weirder than actually existing detective stories, I can't say.) The foregoing shouldn't be taken to mean that comparative literature should slavishly imitate comparative biology. There are people who have thought about the application of evolutionary ideas to social and cultural change in ways which are much more sophisticated about psychology, social organization and human interaction than (most) advocates of memetics; I am thinking particularly of David Hull, W. G. Runciman, Dan Sperber, Stephen Toulmin's great The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts, and even the fragmentary MS. of Adam Westoby. As the economist Richard Nelson writes, we should expect our ideas of general evolution to change as we learn more about cultural evolution. We should also expect to have to develop different methods of data analysis. But, as always, we start with what we already know how to do. MATERIALISM I share Moretti's hope for a "materialist sociology of literary form." I'd like a materialist sociology of culture generally. But I suspect it won't be able to do everything he wants it to. When Moretti quotes D'Arcy Thompson on how the form of an object is a diagram of the forces which produced it, I'm happy to go along, and even happy to agree that this gives us some ability to work backwards, from form to force. But this sort of inverse problem generally doesn't have a unique solution, especially if some of the forces were transient and highly contingent ... Less metaphorically, something Lieberson argues very convincingly is that we often have to distinguish between the social forces causing there to be a change in some taste, and those which shape the content of the new taste. Often the latter mechanisms are more or less internal to the bit of culture in question, like ratcheting. Or:

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 127

culture doesn't have to express or reflect the social order. I suspect Moretti would be disappointed if this were the case for, say, genres of novels. Well, so would I. But this needs to be checked. One way would be to try to develop good neutral models, and see whether, and where, they break down. Dan Sperber has a great essay, in Explaining Culture, on "How to be a genuine materialist in anthropology." He complains about treating Capital, the World-System, cultural symbol-systems, mentalities, etc. as reified causal forces, if not self-interested foresightful agents, forgetting that human history, society and culture are actually (if I may quote Marx and Engels): "real individuals, their activity and the conditions under which they live." It seems, at least to this interested outsider, that the study of literature in society also suffers from the ills Sperber diagnoses in anthropology. And I think what he advocates there should go here, too: give actual causal accounts of how macroscopic patterns emerge from the interaction of many material bodies (notably, people and books), of the sort we know to exist, endowed with the kinds of abilities we know them to have. This commitment may sound harmless, because contentless, but it does actually have implications. It means that you have to do a lot of work to justify functionalist explanations (though it's not impossible. See Elster.) It should make you very dubious about ideal types (Mayer again. It should make you more interested in exploring variation, and not dismissing it. It should make you very dubious about "practices" and other shared mental objects, at least as ordinarily conceived (see Turner). And it suggests a lot of productive directions, investigating communication, cognition, and the collective patterns they produce. In Graphs, Maps, Trees, as in his Atlas, Moretti is basically looking at the communication end of things. He doesn't say much about cognition, or individual thought more generally.

128 

Cosma Shalizi

Elsewhere (see e.g. Signs Taken for Wonders) he has dabbled in psychoanalysis, but I hope that's past. A materialist theory of literary form will ultimately have to concern itself with the organic processes of reading and composition, but the way to do this is through empirical study of readers and writers, not more interpretation of texts, or armchair ruminations (whether those are on the primal scene, the environment of evolutionary adaptation, or conceptual blending). Of course literary scholars have been making stabs in this direction at least since I. A. Richards's Practical Criticism, but with the advent of cognitive psychology this can be done in a much more systematic way, combining modeling of cognition with experimental tests of the models.4 Again, many people (e.g., Jerry Hobbs, Herbert Simon) have been proposing this for some little while, but it's only recently, with works like Bortolussi and Dixon's Psychonarratology, that people have begun to actually do it, taking the predictions of various theories of narrative, which say that changing stories in certain ways should affect readers' responses, and seeing whether that's actually right. This, and not desk-bound speculation about analogies, seems to me the proper way to start on a cognitive psychology of literature. It is obviously complementary to what Moretti wants to do, and (this is the sweet part) the two enquiries can be pursued in parallel; neither has to wait for the other. One thing Moretti does not do, anywhere, is construct models linking individual behavior to aggregate patterns. Economists and sociologists already make such models, and anthropologists are starting to do so. It may be premature here, but ultimately it will be vital. If different social groups have different beliefs, is that because those beliefs express their relations to the mode of production, or is it because they tend to talk more with in the group than across group boundaries? Adaptationist theories of culture tend to go for

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 129

the first choice, but we don't really know whether the latter could account for the specific patterns of cultural difference and change that we see. How Not to Learn from the Natural Sciences What I said above about not mindlessly imitating biology deserves some amplification. Evolution ought to have a bad name in the study of literary history. Reading René Wellek's "The Concept of Evolution in Literary History" (or his article for the Dictionary of the History of Ideas) is actually quite depressing. (The figures he discusses--not Wellek himself--bring to mind Kurt Vonnegut's line: "they deserved to fail, because they were all so stupid.") The many post-Darwinian ventures in this direction went, essentially, nowhere, at least as far as understanding literature better goes. It surely didn't help that their understandings of biological evolution were often very bad, generally some kind of Spencerian or even Lamarckian belief in tendencies of progressive development--perhaps inspiring, but hopelessly un-explanatory. (This has vitiated far too much evolutionary theorizing about social processes; cf. Toulmin's chapter 5.) As for the more recent wave, since the 1980s, the people who seem to think that literature exists because humanity craves dramatizations of Daly & Wilson's Sex, Evolution and Behavior drive me up the wall. (Their idea makes no sense even if you are very sympathetic to evolutionary psychology, which I am.) That said, this is not at all what Moretti is proposing, and I don't see the harm in trying to make this all fit together as another instance of a general explanatory pattern, alongside biological evolution, because they have similar causally-relevant features, and so similar mechanisms are at work. Many people have pointed out, in some detail, that explaining biological processes through the joint action of variation and

130 

Cosma Shalizi

selective transmission in populations is one instance of a general pattern of historical explanation; Toulmin is particularly clear on this.5 There is a demography of businesses (Carroll & Hannan), of interest groups (Gray & Lowery) even of medieval manuscripts of classical works (Cisne), and so why not one of literary texts? Inheriting discrete, particulate hereditary factors from a small, fixed number of immediate ancestors is not the sine qua non of this form of historical explanation, though the details of the process of inheritance will very strongly affect the character of the resulting dynamics. It might be that theories of literary change cast in this form are too complicated to be useful, or that we just don't know enough yet to find the useful ways to formulate them. But it wouldn't hurt to seriously try, and we'd learn a lot, no matter the eventual outcome. Varieties of Rational History One way to take the bit from Braudel about "a more rational history" that Moretti adopts as a motto is simply to hope that literary history will be a rational enterprise. There are various aspects to this--the accumulation of knowledge, a desire to give explanations, a realization that more than one explanation might be possible and a desire to check which one is right, and so on. To do all this, it's important to develop, use and refine reliable methods of inquiry--ones which are unlikely to lead you into error, and which tend to correct the errors they do make. You want to be able to persuade others, and you want to know that you're not just persuading yourself. As a statistician, my job is to help with the reliable-methods-ofinquiry bit, so it looms large for me. I think this is more or less what Moretti has in mind when he talks (elsewhere) about wanting "falsifiable" literary history--for ideas which have enough content that they can not only be communicated from one person to another (without tripping Liberman's

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 131

detector), but checked. Which said, I wish that here, as in his Atlas, Moretti had done a more systematic job of checking his conclusions. Would it be unfair to suggest that, while he sees the need for data analysis, it will be left to a successor generation to put it into routine practice? If you want to say that asking literary history to be communicable, testable and reliable is asking it to be scientific and that's icky, well, it's a free country (at least for now). The more I think about what makes something a science, the less that seems like an important question. But whether something is a rational enterprise of inquiry matters. I'm sure it's possible to object to wanting history to be more rational in this sense, but I find that thought so alien and pointless I won't even try to engage it. Another take on "rational history" is that the vast mass of details in small-scale history are essentially random, or, more exactly, the connections among them are as convoluted and involved as the details themselves. (This is one way to define randomness, mathematically.) But looking at larger scales, the randomness averages out, leaving regularities which are simpler and more nearly comprehensible by finite minds, and more reliable. As a statistical physicist and a statistican, I am the last to disagree: "In fact, all epistemological value of the theory of probability is based on this: that large-scale random phenomena in their collective action create strict, nonrandom regularity" (Gnedenko & Kolmogorov, 1). The small-scale details of literature and of human life have an intrinsic interest and value that is missing from the small-scale detail of molecular chaos, so there is certainly all the room in the world for what Moretti would like to do and close reading, and even essayistic appreciation. (But there is not, I am afraid, room enough in the world for Harold Bloom.) Whether there is room in an academy organized around the production of peer-reviewed research findings for all of them, is fortunately not a question I need to have an opinion on.

Finally, you might be tempted to go from the last sense of "rational" to supposing that large-scale history must be the working-out of some scheme which is "rational" in that it's really deterministic, or even teleological. This would be a mistake. It is not at all hard to give examples of stochastic processes that combine random evolution and feedback, which converge on very nice large-scale regularities, but which regularity they converge on is completely random and indeterminate.6 Brian Arthur, among others, argues that processes like this are important in the evolution of technology. Is literature like that? I have no idea. But I don't see any reason it can't be, and this needs to be borne in mind. GO FISH Let me close by quoting the same paragraph twice, once from the version in NLR, and then again from the closing pages of the book. In both cases, Moretti is enumerating themes which stretch across his chapters.
First, a total indifference to the philosophizing that goes by the name of `Theory' in literature departments. It is precisely in the name of theoretical knowledge that `Theory' should be forgotten, and replaced with the extraordinary array of conceptual constructions, --theories, plural, and with a lower case `t'--developed by the natural and by the social sciences. `Theories are nets', wrote Novalis, `and only he who casts will catch'. Theories are nets, and we should learn to evaluate them for the empirical data they allow us to process and understand: for how they concretely change the way we work, rather than as ends in themselves. Theories are nets; and there are so many interesting creatures that await to be caught, if only we try. ("Trees," 63)

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 133

First of all, a somewhat pragmatic view of theoretical knowledge. `Theories are nets', wrote Novalis, `and only he who casts will catch'. Yes, theories are nets, and we should evaluate them, not as ends in themselves, but for how they concretely change the way we work: for how they allow us to enlarge the literary field, and re-design it in a better way, replacing the old, useless distinctions (high and low; canon and archive; this or that national literature...) with new temporal, spatial and morphological distinctions. (91)

Whether this pragmatic message is what Novalis meant, I have no idea; I only know the line because Popper used it as the epigraph for The Logic of Scientific Discovery. But that's what Popper meant by it, and I think it's right, and I look forward to seeing the coelocanths and tube worms and giant squid which will be brought up from the deeps in years to come.

1 More on testing the null model of genre appearance, for those into that kind of thing: Really, of course, the most suitable null model for random appearance would be a continuous-time Poisson process. Since the data are discretized by years, however, I'm faking it by using a geometric distribution of inter-arrival intervals. (I also tried simulating from a Poisson process and then discretizing the result; the results weren't much different.) The only parameter of such a process is the mean inter-arrival time, or equivalently the "intensity," the probability per year of producing a new genre. Simple maximum likelihood estimation gives this as 0.2905405, which implies a log-likelihood for the original

136 

Cosma Shalizi

data of -103.9498. To evaluate the significance, I generated 1,000,000 sample paths, of the same length as Moretti's, and then for each one reestimated the intensity and used that to evaluate the log-likelihood. (This sort of "bootstrapping" should account for the fact that I fit that parameter to the data in the first place. It wouldn't be appropriate if, say, Moretti had advanced the conjecture that the mean inter-arrival time should be 10 years on independent grounds.) Of the 1,000,000 sample paths, only 3,802 had loglikelihoods as small or smaller than the original data. That is to say, if the null model were correct, we'd see results like this only about 0.38 percent of the time. So we can certainly reject the null model at the conventional 5 percent significance level, or even the 1 percent level, and in fact this is a considerably more severe test than that. 2 From Sydney Winter, who works out the analogy in some detail. 3 "Adventures of a Man of Science," Elif Batuman's wonderfully-titled review of Graphs, Maps, Trees in n+1 magazine ( January 6th, 2006), is a quite nice essay, but it also provides what looks like a typical example of the kind of mere plausibility I have in mind: "Perhaps the Holmes stories are not half-baked versions of the "correct" mystery story, but a different kind of mystery story, wherein the nondecodability of clues is not a bug, but a feature. Conan Doyle was writing during the conquest of England by industry and rational-

Graphs, Trees, Materialism, Fishing

 137

ism; perhaps his readers wanted stories about the kinds of magic that are possible within the constraints of science. Holmes categorically rejects the supernatural, not in order to show that the new, rational rules preclude magic, but in order to show that you can still have magic even if you play by the rules. Decodable clues came a "generation" later, with Agatha Christie and the first World War, and became more rigorous after the second--by which time readers wanted to be reminded that the world was still rational." (146-147) First of all, it seems bizarre to say that Britain was being conquered by "industry and rationalism" in the 1890s, long after the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment (cf. Porter) the Industrial Revolution (cf. Deane)and all its social consequences (cf. Thompson), utilitarianism, etc. (Indeed, Mr. Lecky might want to have a few words ...) Second, Batuman gives us no reason to think that contemporary readers saw what Holmes did as (pardon the phrase) magic within the bounds of reason alone. Third, even if she were right about the social situation and the cultural product, the hypothesized causal connection is really just another arbitrary analogy, of the sort Elster complained about. Suppose Conan Doyle had been better about using decodable clues than Christie. Would it not then sound just as plausible to say this expresses the triumph of rationalism, followed by a post-war weakening? As it is, Batuman's account seems to appeal, implicitly, to a desire to hang on to older ways of thinking. Either the whole reading public of Britain in the 1890s is being treated, in

138 

Cosma Shalizi

a grossly anthropomorphic fashion, as a single person, with such a desire, or she is making a quite specific prediction about which readers Conan Doyle appealed to, one which does not seem especially plausible, though it might be tested. (It is utterly unclear whose purposes or needs are invokes by the in-order-to's--Conan Doyle's? his original readers'? society's?--but I fear the worst.) Finally, no attempt is made to check that this is the source of the appeal, nor that the later strict decodability of clues really was caused by the World Wars, for the reasons given. I don't know enough to say that this suggestion is false, or that checking it would be impossible. I don't even want to suggest that a book review in a little magazine would be a good place to do such tests. But it doesn't seem to worry Batuman that there is no support for this idea (yet).--Let me repeat that I like the essay. 4 Incidentally, thinking that cognition is computational, and even that its computational architecture is strongly constrained by organicallyevolved developmental processes, in no way commits one to denying that thought is also profoundly cultural and historical. Sperber is very good on this, but also see Frawley; or the papers collected in the Lupia, McCubbins, and Popkin volume. 5 Of course it isn't the only pattern of successful historical explanation. Even within the natural sciences, geology and astronomy provide very different ones.

6 More exactly, there are stochastic processes ("urn schemes") where the relative frequencies of different outcomes are guaranteed to converge, with 100% probability, but the ratio at which they converge is itself a random variable, not determined by the initial set-up in any way. The models of lock-in developed by Brian Arthur and his collaborators in the 1980s are urn models, but actually less indeterministic than the classical ones.

Abstract
As the use of data mining and machine learning methods in the humanities becomes more common, it will be increasingly important to examine implicit biases, assumptions, and limitations these methods bring with them. This article makes explicit some of the foundational assumptions of machine learning methods, and presents a series of experiments as a case study and object lesson in the potential pitfalls in the use of data mining methods for hypothesis testing in literary scholarship. The worst dangers may lie in the humanist's ability to interpret nearly any result, projecting his or her own biases into the outcome of an experiment--perhaps all the more unwittingly due to the superficial objectivity of computational methods. We argue that in the digital humanities, the standards for the initial production of evidence should be even more rigorous than in the empirical sciences because of the subjective nature of the work that follows. Thus, we conclude with a discussion of recommended best practices for making results from data mining in the humanities domain as meaningful as possible. These include methods for keeping the the boundary between computational results and subsequent interpretation as clearly delineated as possible.

A person who is trying to understand a text is always projecting. He projects a meaning for the text as a whole as some initial meaning emerges in the text. Again, the initial meaning only emerges because he is reading the text with particular expectations in regard to a certain meaning. Working out this fore-projection, which is constantly revised in terms of what emerges as he penetrates into the meaning, is understanding what is there. ­ Hans Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method

1 Introduction
In any new relationship--scholarly or otherwise--it is what is not said that can be most harmful. Coming from disparate backgrounds, we tend to believe that our own assumptions are shared assumptions. When these are left tacit at the outset, they may become all the more damaging when it is discovered that beliefs thought to be self-evident by one party are considered surprising or outlandish by the other. The collaborative field of

digital humanities, still in its nascency, is characterized by new collaborations between scholars of language and literature on the one hand, and computer scientists on the other. It is unlikely that the assumptions of one field are held as tenets of the other. Furthermore, because these fields are so different, it may be difficult for scholars in each field to articulate and pose questions for one another. We do not know what it is that we do not know, or even what to ask of each other. In this article, we attempt to bridge the disciplinary divide by making some of these assumptions explicit. In particular, we examine literary methods and literary critical premises, placing them in contrast with the implicit assumptions underlying data mining and machine learning methodologies. In order to establish a ground for this conversation between the disciplines, we work our way through a case study, employing data mining techniques in hypothesis testing. Specifically, we investigate a purported connection between metaphor and political affiliation, using a classifier to predict an author's party politics. Needless to say, this venture remains fraught with peril. As will be apparent, it is all too easy to draw mistaken conclusions when using the powerful tools afforded by machine learning.

2 Background: Fears of Circularity
In his masterpiece, Truth and Method, Hans-Georg Gadamer presents a philosophy and history of interpretation, following interpretive practices from their scriptural origins through Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and Heidegger. Gadamer writes, `A person who is trying to understand a text is always projecting . . . working out [a] fore-projection, which is constantly revised in terms of what emerges' (p. 267). The interpreter is implicated in circularity because he must project meaning onto the very object that he hopes will disclose its meaning for him. After selecting literary material and selecting features of that material for analysis, we hope that meaningful patterns emerge from out of what is already there. But we must always take into account the powerful determinations of our own fore-projections.
410 Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 23, No. 4, 2008

The digital humanities, still struggling to establish its legitimacy, is characterized by its own peculiar anxieties about circularity. How do the results of computer-assisted textual analysis (often packaged as graphs and scatter plots) come to speak to a traditional literary critic? The critic in question would have read the plays, poems, or novels that serve as the basis of the mining, clustering, or classifying experiment, and he or she would either come to find his or her previous readings of the texts confirmed in the abstract model or dismiss the results and the validity of the computational methods that produced them. The model itself must be interpreted, and the critic brings his prior readings to bear on the abstract representation in just the same way he would bring them to bear on the text itself. The critic reads varieties of confirmation into the results or dismisses them.1 What can the computer tell the literary scholar-- that know-it-all who is ever ready with an interpretation, who can assimilate almost any piece of information to his or her pet theory? At The Valve Matthew Kirschenbaum reports the results of data mining experiments with Emily Dickinson's correspondence. One of the Dickinson scholars involved in the experiments saw that the word `mine' ranked high on the list of words that had been predicted as indicators of erotic language. She reflects, `The minute I saw it, I had one of those ``I knew that'' moments.' The scholar finds occasion to stage a reading of the term `mine'2 and delivers the following appraisal of text mining methods: `So the data mining has made me plumb much more deeply into little four- and five-letter words, the function of which I thought I was already sure, and has enabled me to expand and deepen some critical connections I've been making for the last 20 years.' Although the scholar registers surprise (`I thought I was already sure'), we hear her own interpretative machinery assimilating the computer-generated results with alarming ease. Who has plumbed more deeply here? The machine or the scholar? And while the `critical connections' are expanded and deepened, they are not revised, replaced, or overthrown.3 The interpreter of a poem moves from the words, sentences, verses, and stanzas to the largest structure to which they contribute. The text is a whole, and to

understand it is to understand its parts.4 But the text itself is situated in a larger context of texts, a whole tradition of texts. In the recent quantitative turn taken in Franco Moretti's scholarship, we find an exciting polemic against the production of `readings'. Moretti would have us direct our efforts at explanation, not interpretation and demands a complete account of the novel or, even more grandly, the world system of literature as the goal of literary history. His methods do not offer `a new reading' of a canonical novel, such as Waverley 5 `but aim to understand the larger structures within which [a novel like Waverley comes to] have meaning in the first place' (p. 63). Moretti would have us change our basic unit of analysis: instead of the individual text we should look to the great unread multitude of texts that compose a genre. We find Moretti's mention of Waverley particularly appropriate. Waverley is, after all, the novel that Georg ´ cs treats as representative of historical fiction Luka as such. Scott's `average' or `typical' hero, Waverley, stands in the center of a greater socio-political history. The novel's plot seeks a `neutral ground' in which we find `extreme, opposing social forces . . . brought into human relationship with one another' ´ cs, 1983, p. 36). Reading Waverley we make it (Luka stand for something larger; we read it, in fact, under ´ cs' influence, as itself involved in those larger Luka structures we look to in order to gauge a particular text's meaning `in the first place'. Again, we cannot help but trace a hermeneutic circle, moving from a textual instance to some near totality and back. Moretti's promotion of `distant reading' practices gains ground in a digital humanities, in large part, because the practices are well suited to the projects imagined by those who seek new research opportunities in an online digital `million book' library. It is predicted that in working with the largest wholes, we digital humanists will be in a position to make better sense of the relations that govern the innumerable parts. While questions remain as to how to work with so much material, there is a growing consensus that machine learning may allow us function at this highest level of granularity. The leading edge of `computation into criticism' may then be moving away from text analysis to data mining and other machine learning methods. Speaking about

collaborative efforts, John Unsworth has claimed `The computer provides us with the ability to keep track of enormous amounts of information, to sort and select that information rapidly and in many different ways, and to uncover in reams of mute data the aesthetically and intellectually apprehensible patterns on which understanding depends' (Unsworth, 1997).

3 Assumptions in Data Mining
Is distant reading amenable to machine learning? The tools of data mining and machine learning are built on the foundation of computational learning theory. First formalized in Valiant's 1984 paper `A Theory of the Learnable' (Valiant, 1984), learning theory provides guarantees on the learnability of arbitrary concepts, based on certain fundamental assumptions. These assumptions are at odds with those of the average humanities scholar--thus, it is worth stating them explicitly here.

3.1 Examples are drawn from a fixed distribution
Learning theory assumes that the data is produced by some process with constant probabilistic qualities. Examples are drawn identically and independently (i.i.d.) from this distribution. The key is that the distribution's probabilistic behavior does not change over time, and that it will continue to produce as many examples as requested. This assumption enables a formalization of the idea of generalization, and allows bounds to be proved demonstrating that a hypothesis learned on previous data may be able to predict labels for future data. In data mining for the humanities, this assumption rarely if ever holds. Literary critics almost always work with historical data and attend to some important moment of change: an author's formation of a `late style', the establishment of vernacular literature in the shadow of a classical inheritance, the refinement and reinvention of the sonnet cycle in the early modern period, or the rise or elevation of the novel in the eighteenth century to name a few. Furthermore, the data sets they work
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 23, No. 4, 2008 411

D. Sculley and B. M. Pasanek

with are often fixed or limited in size. Although it is common practice in data mining to use fixed training and test sets to approximate the effect of an i.i.d., we must be wary when the size of the data sets becomes too restricted. Typically, English literature monographs explore a thesis in the selected works of five or six authors. Thus, we must pay strict attention to the manner in which the data sets are constructed, as biased sampling (in which the i :i :d assumption is broken) may radically skew the qualities of the approximated distribution. Perhaps even more troubling for many humanities scholars, the idea of a fixed distribution implies that there is, at some level, a fixed truth. Data mining tools require this assumption of a fixed distribution to be true, yet the mere mention of `truth' may make some literary critics uneasy. Literary criticism has spent generations exploring textual ambiguity and instability--reveling in `the pleasure of the text'. While this may be the single core principle of much literary theory (coded var´rance'), it is paradoxiously as `ambiguity' or `diffe ical in many of its formulations at best. Pleasure is subjective. De gustibus non disputandem est. Interpretations are relative to a theory, to a time, or to a reader--to a palate. Outside of a narrowly circumscribed interpretive community, there is no best way to interpret a text. In recent years especially, literary critics have relied on a kind of theoretical promiscuousness or bricolage when approaching texts, borrowing from various theories and theorists as necessary to undergird or emphasize a point.

necessarily influences the choice of learning algorithm used for the data. Are we searching for a linear decision boundary in high-dimensional space? Such a representation would require a learning method such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), or variants of the perceptron or winnow algorithms. Do we believe there is a clearly observable statistical process producing the data points? In these cases, a generative model such as a naive Bayesian classifier, Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models would be most appropriate. Perhaps the hypothesis would be best represented as a set of logical conjunctions, suggesting decision trees. Here, again, experimenter assumptions operate at the forefront and directly impact the design of experiment and subsequent results. And it is hard to say a priori what the best hypothesis space is for a particular literary exploration, such as distinguishing metaphor from metonym or isolating a brute fact of the literary marketplace.

3.3 The data is well represented
The first two assumptions are expressed in terms of abstract distributions and hypothesis spaces. However, for results on real data to be meaningful, the representation of the data must be sufficient to capture the salient qualities of that data. Because these representations are, necessarily, simplified abstractions of the real objects, there is a danger that these simplifications are inadequate for capturing important qualities. Worse still is the possibility that such a projection may introduce distortions or procedural artifacts into our representation of the data. For example, consider the problem of representing a piece of text. One common methodology is to use the `bag of words' model, where a document is represented by a histogram, with a unique bin for each word that contains a score related to the number of times that word appears in the document. This representation has been extremely successful in the text classification domain (Mitchell, 1997), despite the obvious drawback that all sequence information of the words is discarded. If we decide to employ a bag of words model, the selection of a term scoring method requires an additional decision that impacts the representation.

3.2 The hypothesis space C is restricted
A hypothesis space is the set of all possible concepts that the learning method might produce. Learning theory requires that this hypothesis space be subject to defined restrictions, otherwise generalization cannot be guaranteed. To see this intuitively, note that with no restrictions a learner can always `learn' on training data with 100% accuracy simply by rote memorization of the training data. Yet, this rote learner may have no ability to predict a label of a new, unseen example. The experimenter must therefore decide what form of hypothesis is most appropriate, and this

Impact of implicit assumptions

In information-retrieval tasks, TF­IDF (term frequency­inverse document frequency) scores have been successful (Salton and Buckley, 1988); in the spam filtering domain, binary term weights have proven superior (Metsis et al., 2006). Other possibilities include giving terms higher scores if they appear closer to the beginning of the document, or using some form of semantic analysis to propagate term scores to related terms in the histogram. Moreover, it is not clear that the bag of words model is itself always optimal. In some cases, counting phrases may be more important; in other cases, tagging parts of speech or tracking sequences of words is paramount. In still other cases, the optical characteristics of the actual letters are of greatest import. The simplest poem is an interaction of grammar, assonance, consonance, enjambment, trope, allusion, and meter. Complexity is multiplied when we work with discourse at large and try to represent a motley collection of poems, novels, essays, and plays. Consider now the difficulty of designing the most appropriate feature representation for impressionist description or political rhetoric. In every case, the experimenter must make assumptions about what is most important in the data.

mean that data mining methods are not a useful set of pattern-finding tools for humanities scholars, we must take particular care to explicate the exact set of implicit assumptions we make before drawing interpretations from any results. Some of these challenges and potential pitfalls are illustrated in the following section.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself ­ and you are the easiest person to fool. ­ Richard Feynman, `Cargo Cult Science' Fortified by a review of fundamental assumptions, we set about to test a hypothesis from political theory empirically, using data mining methods on historical textual data. We take as our hypothesis the general belief, widely held in the humanities, that political beliefs and the use of figurative language are importantly if not fundamentally correlated.

4.1 Lakoff's hypothesis: politics and metaphor
Metaphor is deep in our language, deep in our concept schemes, or so claim thinkers as different as Jacques Derrida and George Lakoff. Richard Rorty puts it with point: `It is pictures rather than propositions, metaphors rather than statements, which determine most of our philosophical convictions' (p. 12). Indeed, in two recent bestselling books on moral politics and issue framing, the linguist George Lakoff has claimed that political debates are contests between root conceptual metaphors (Lakoff, 2002). Party affiliation is rooted in metaphorically structured mental models (in `pictures' not `propositions'). Lakoff's is a provocative idea, one that has been recently entertained by political strategists influential in the Democratic Party of the United States, and in the past few years, Lakoff has been invited by Nancy Pelosi to coach the Democratic caucus and has consulted with Howard Dean, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton. However, the validity of the conceptual link between metaphorical structures and political affiliation has not yet been

3.4 There is no free lunch
At first, it may appear that the answer to these problems of experimenter bias in feature representation and hypothesis space is to create a meta-learner, that searches through all the different hypothesis spaces, and all the different feature representations to find the optimal design. However, this is provably impossible, as demonstrated by the No Free Lunch Theorem (Wolpert and Macready, 1995). In traditional data mining applications, the No Free Lunch Theorem means that there is no single best learning algorithm, and we may have to employ a good deal of ingenuity to learn from difficult data. In data mining for the humanities, where learning algorithms are not necessarily used for prediction but instead for exploration and hypothesis testing, the implications are somewhat more severe. In these latter applications, data mining methods will always be subject to experimenter bias. While this does not

experimentally verified. Many commentators remain dubious about Lakoff's claims. Lakoff, a cognitive linguist, bases his claims in the theory of `conceptual metaphor'. Lakoff believes that our concept schemes are metaphorically structured and argues that metaphors `play an enormous role in characterizing our worldviews' (p. 63). Linguistic metaphor is evidence of mappings or correspondences between concepts across conceptual domains. `It is extremely common for such metaphors to be fixed in our conceptual systems, and thousands of such metaphors contribute to our everyday modes of thought' (p. 63). In political contexts, Lakoff argues that moral thinking `depends fundamentally on metaphorical understanding' (p. 41).

4.2 Hypothesis testing
Lakoff's claims indicate a ground for historical inquiry. If metaphors signal structures of belief and different parties form around different metaphorical models, we should be able to distinguish between different eighteenth-century political parties by distinguishing the kinds of metaphors they used. Thus, we would expect, if Lakoff is correct, that metaphorical usage alone would be sufficient information to predict an author's political affiliation. If Lakoff's claims for metaphor are unfounded, metaphors alone will prove insufficient for this prediction. We can put this hypothesis to the test by using supervised machine learning methodology. The basic idea is to train a classifier on a set of labeled data, where metaphors are examples and political affiliation are labels, and then to test this classifier on a previously unseen set of metaphors. If the classifier is able to predict the political affiliation of authors based solely on their metaphorical usage, we can take that as supporting evidence for Lakoff's hypothesis. 4.2.1 Methodology We select SVMs as our classifier of choice for these experiments, as this is considered the state of the art classification method for textual data (Joachims, 1998). We give a brief overview of this methodology here; the reader is directed to
414 Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 23, No. 4, 2008

Scholkopf and Smola (2002) for a complete discussion of SVMs and their variants. In the standard machine learning approach to text classification, each piece of text is represented as a point in a particular kind of space, which we will describe below. The pieces of text used for training are each given a label, generally þ1 if it belongs to one of the classes, and À1 if it belongs to the other class.6 A linear classifier, such as a linear SVM, finds a line (or, more properly, a hyperplane) that attempts to divide texts of one class from the other.7 When the two classes are well separated, drawing such a dividing line is easy and the classifier is likely to have high predictive accuracy on other texts. When the two classes are not easily distinguished in the space--perhaps because of overlapping or intermingling--then it becomes impossible to draw a `perfect' dividing line. In this case, the learning method tries to minimize error as much as possible. As mentioned above, each piece of text is represented as a point (or vector) in a certain kind of space. Recall that a space is defined as a set of axes, or coordinates. The text space has a unique coordinate for each of the words in the lexicon, and is thus a high-dimensional space. Interestingly, in high-dimensional spaces, it is surprisingly easy to find ways to divide one class from another by taking advantage of many different coordinates. Intuitively, however, such a line has inherently high complexity, and thus may be an over-specific fit to the training data with poor ability to generalize. This notion harkens back to Occam's razor from the fourteenth century, and is supported by statistical learning theory (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002). SVMs handle the problem of high dimensionality by preferring a solution that both minimizes training error and is as simple as possible. This is what is meant by the statement that SVMs maximize the margin between the two data classes (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002). Finding a line with the largest possible `border' between the data classes does both tasks of minimizing error and maintaining simplicity. Typically, the goals of simplicity and accuracy are in opposition; thus, SVMs have a user-set parameter C that determines how much weight to assign to each of these goals. Thus, SVMs are a strong

choice for text classification, which is an inherently high-dimensional task. 4.2.2 Data Our source of metaphorical data was the Mind is a Metaphor database, a hand-curated collection of thousands of metaphors of the mind that occur in eighteenth century English literature (Pasanek, 2006). To prepare our data, we mapped each piece of metaphorical text to an example vector using the binary bag of words approach (Salton and Buckley, 1988). Each word corresponds to a unique coordinate (or, feature), and that feature is given a score of 1 if the word occurs in the piece of metaphorical text and 0 otherwise. This approach was chosen over a count-based scheme because the pieces of text were quite short; typically one sentence or a small group of sentences. (We follow Lakoff and a majority of Anglo-American philosophers of language in treating metaphor as a sentence-level phenomenon.) Each example was given a label of political affiliation of Whig, Tory, or Radical. This labeling was accomplished by labeling the politics of the authors as specified by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Harrison, 2007). In those cases where the ODNB did not indicate an author's politics, we threw out the metaphors associated with the author. Furthermore, we availed ourselves of an oversimplification: for the purposes of our experiments, all metaphors produced by Tory author were labeled as `Tory' metaphors. In all our experiments, we used the libsvm package as our SVM engine, with a linear hypothesis and the cost parameter C set to the default setting. 4.2.3 Cross-validation by metaphor In our first trial, we created training data by mapping metaphors to bag of words vectors, using binary feature scoring. No word stemming was performed, and no stop words were removed. We performed 5-fold cross-validation by metaphor-- that is, each metaphor was assigned uniformly at random to one of five distinct test sets, with the remainder of the data used as the corresponding training set for that run. We performed random sub-sampling of the data weighted by class size, to ensure that each of the three classes were of equal

sizes in our final data set. We report the results for this trial in Table 1, which gives a confusion matrix of predictions compiled over this set of crossvalidation tests. The confusion matrix reports several pieces of information. First, within the grid, the raw counts show how many times an actual Tory, say, was (wrongly) classified as a Whig. Second, the precision measure answers the question: of all the times we predicted an example to be a Tory (for example), how often were we correct? Third, the recall measure addresses the complementary question: of all the Tories in the data, what fraction did we correctly detect? Finally, information gain gives a measure of how much better than random guessing the classifier's predictions are, where pure random guessing scores a 0 (Duda et al., 2000). Looking at these results, we see a strong diagonal, good precision and recall (against an expected baseline of 0.33), and strong information gain. Thus, based on the results of this experiment, we can say there is a strong signal connecting metaphorical usage to political affiliation, and while correlations should not be confused with a structure of causation (is it, in fact, our politics that predispose us to particular metaphors or does another, more fundamental factor correlate party and metaphor?), it would seem that an author's choice of metaphors signal his or her party affiliation. In short, Lakoff appears to be right. 4.2.4 Cross-validation by author If we only sought the barest proof for Lakoff's hypothesis, we would be done. However, it is possible that cross-validation by metaphor may not be the most meaningful test for this data. Recall that
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 23, No. 4, 2008 415

D. Sculley and B. M. Pasanek

the process of cross-validation breaks the data into partitions of test data and training data. With crossvalidation by metaphor, standard practice in machine learning is upheld as the same example never appears in the same test and training sets. However, it is possible for some metaphors from a given author to appear in a training set, and other metaphors from that same author to appear in the test set. In this case the classifier may be simply learning to recognize individual author vocabularies rather than an overall political affiliation. To guard against this, we repeated the experiment with the same experimental design, but this time performing cross-validation by author. That is, all of a given author's metaphors were assigned to the same randomly selected test set. The results for this experiment are given in Table 2 and show, strikingly, that the signal connecting metaphorical usage to political affiliation has effectively disappeared. Precision and recall are now near the random baseline of 0.33, and there is near zero information gain. In short, Lakoff appears to be wrong. And where Lakoff is wrong, another student of politics may be right. The historian Lewis Namier and his modern inheritors may come forward here. It is Namier and his followers who argue that the great Parliamentary battles of the mid-eighteenth century were not between Whigs and Tories, but between groups of Whigs. Ultimately, Namier's interpretation of eighteenth-century party politics sweeps party distinctions aside. Namier draws his picture of man from psychoanalysis: instinct, self-interest, habits, and the reproduction of Oedipal structures constitute the deep structure of individuals, nation, and history. By Namier's lights, the `Whig interpretation' of the eighteenth century focuses intently on ideology and party relations. Namier's corrective replaces the party with the individual and his ambitions. 4.2.5 Cross-validation by author with basic feature preprocessing With conflicting results from our first two experiments, we revisited our assumptions about how best to represent the text. The first two experiments were performed on `raw' bag-of-words features.

That is, each unique word was considered to be a unique feature, so that the words `mind' and `minds' would be thought of as distinct features. Furthermore, all words were considered to be features, including very frequent stop words such as `the' and `what', and very rare words that may have occurred only once or twice in the entire corpus. Treating word-based features in this way imposes little experimenter bias, but may also subject the classifier to unnecessary noise in the data. It is common practice in text mining and information retrieval to perform word stemming and remove stop words and very uncommon words for improved performance. We follow this practice in this, our third experiment. But the reader must be reminded that, in this experiment we are now removing a great number of little three- and fourletter words--words like `mine' that our Dickinson scholar found so very provocative. These words that are not readily visible to the literary critic are the centerpiece of studies that follow John Burrows' classic work with Jane Austen's stylistics (Burrows, 1987). The results for this experiment are given in Table 3, and show some measurable (but not particularly strong) signal connecting metaphorical usage to political affiliation. Indeed, it may be that neither Namier nor Lakoff is right. These results begin to suggest a new interpretation: the classifier shows better precision in identifying Tories and radicals. Indeed, the results go some way to illustrating J. G. A. Pocock's claim that the outsider politics of Tories and radicals and Opposition Whigs draw on a common language of `civic humanism' (Pocock, 1985).

4.2.6 Cross-validation by author, with preprocessing and latent semantic analysis The word stemming from the third experiment allowed us to capture the similarity between morphological variations of the same word. However, it did not let us take semantic similarity into account, such as may exist between, say, `stone' and `rock'. Thus, there may have been similar metaphorical usage that was missed in the our previous experiments because of these semantic considerations. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a wellestablished technique from information retrieval (Skillicorn, 2007) to automatically detect semantic relationships between words, based on detection of co-occurrence via singular value decomposition of the term­document matrix. We perform LSA using the top 50 singular values from our term­metaphor matrix, and repeat the experiment with this semantically informed feature representation. The results for this experiment are given in Table 4, and now show an increased signal significantly stronger than random, but by no means absolute or definitive. As we have said all along, Lakoff is more or less right. 4.2.7 Distant readings and close readings When working with metaphors it is important to prepare the data in a way that shows off semantic similarities and ignores stylistic issues. There is a case to be made for the word stemming and LSA: metaphor would seem to be a matter of semantics. And so we massage our data. But clearly, we cannot draw meaningful conclusions from any one of these four experiments in isolation. In order to interpret these results, a close consideration of the full set of experimental results is required.

Downloaded from http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/ at Columbia University Libraries on March 21, 2012

One of the ironies here is that machine learning methods, which seemed so promising as a way of performing what Moretti calls distant reading or what Martin Mueller calls, perhaps even more provocatively, not-reading, is that they require us to trade in a close reading of the original text for something that looks like a close reading of experimental results--a reading that must navigate ambiguity and contradiction. Where we had hoped to explain or understand those larger structures within which an individual text has meaning in the first place, we find ourselves acting once again as interpreters. The confusion matrix, authored in part by the classifier, is a new text, albeit a strange sort of text, one that sends us back to those texts it purports to be about. Like Scott's `typical' or `average' hero, Waverley, the table of results stands for a greater sociopolitical history.

4.3 Clustering
One might think that the ambiguities of the previous set of experiments were owing to the employment of a supervised learning methodology that was employed. These supervised classifiers were trained on data using particular choices of data representation and experimental design, choices that encoded implicit assumptions on the part of the experimenters. Perhaps an unsupervised learning methodology, such as unsupervised clustering, would allow the data to be expressed with less imposition of practitioner bias or `fore-projection'. To explore this idea, we now examine Lakoff's proposed connection between metaphorical usage and political affiliation involved hierarchical clustering of a subset of metaphors. Hierarchical clustering is one unsupervised clustering method which

attempts to find underlying structure in data, and present it in an interpretable visual format as a hierarchical tree. In general, hierarchical clustering works by iteratively joining the most similar pair of examples; however, there are important design choices to be made in choosing a particular hierarchical clustering algorithm. What is the feature space that will be used, and what similarity measure will be used to determine what the `most similar' pair of examples is at any given step? As stated above, owing to the No Free Lunch Theorem, it is impossible to choose the best feature representation, scoring method, or similarity measures a priori in the general case. Thus, responsibility falls back upon the human researcher to decide among the available design parameters. To illustrate this difficulty, we constructed three hierarchical clusterings of all of the `court' metaphors in the Mind is a Metaphor database (Pasanek, 2006), by representing them with bag of words vectors using three different feature-scoring methods. These feature-scoring methods are:  Binary scoring--each bag of words vector element was given a score of 1 if the corresponding word occurred in the metaphor, and 0 if it did not. This scoring method considers all words to be equally informative.  TF­IDF scoring--each word is given an IDF score, which weights rare words as being more
418 Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 23, No. 4, 2008

informative (Salton and Buckley, 1988), where `rarity' is measured with respect to a reference corpus (here, the entire metaphor database). This score is then multiplied by a TF count of how many times the word occurred in the metaphor. Thus, rare words occuring often in a metaphor receive high scores.  Kullback­Liebler divergence (KLD) scoring-- here, each word is given a score based on the divergence in probability distribution (Duda et al., 2000) between the word in normal usage (defined by a reference corpus), and the probability distribution of the word in metaphorical usage (defined by the particular subset of metaphors under consideration). Thus, words that are especially strongly connected to the metaphors at hand get high scores. We then performed hierarchical clustering using the software developed by Stolcke (1996) on the data using each of these three feature representations. The results for binary feature scoring are shown in Fig. 1 and show no meaningful political grouping of authors based on metaphorical data. The results for feature scoring using the TF­IDF scoring method are given in Fig. 2, and show some political grouping of authors by metaphorical usage. Finally, the results in Fig. 3 show the effect of feature scoring using KLD, which gives very clear groupings

of authors into political divisions based on metaphorical usage, and also clearly disambiguates two senses of the word `court'. Whigs and Tories are clustered away from each other by this word sense disambiguation and we begin to see that a Whiggish political idiom has more to do with testimony and jurisprudence whereas a Tory idiom depends on the

Queen's court--Queen Anne's court almost certainly, for it is Queen Anne who reigns during those brief years in the early eighteenth century when a successful Tory ministry controlled the Parliament. From a data mining perspective, each of these experiments was performed in a valid manner.

Yet each of them conveys different meaning to the literary historian who is trying to establish clear correlations in the eighteenth century between metaphorical usage and political affiliation. Is there a Whig idiom? A constellation of Tory metaphors? Is a political ideology a tissue of commonplaces? These are hotly debated questions in literary criticism and political history. Unfortunately, our experiments do not position us to make any final pronouncement concerning Lakoff's theories. Our experiments do invite new forms of reading and interpretation, as the literary historian is forced to perform a careful study of the results, in each case bringing his own understanding of the period's political rhetoric to bear on these conflicting sets of valid results.

5 Methods and Meaning: a Dada Parable
Carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag. Shake gently. Next, take each cutting out one after the other. Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag. The poem will resemble you. ­ Tristan Tzara, `How to Make a Dadaist Poem'

One difficulty that we encounter repeatedly in data mining for the humanities is that just because results are statistically valid and humanly interpretable does not guarantee that they are meaningful. Consider, as an emblem of our methods, the Dadaist approach of cutting a text into words and then pulling the words at random from a bag.8 This approach to poetry caused a riot in the 1920s, and yet is based in a statistically valid (if simplistic) methodology known as Gibbs sampling (Duda et al., 2000). To illustrate this point, we performed Gibbs sampling on the words in the Mind is a Metaphor database to create ten summary lines of fifteen words each, shown in Fig. 4. Taken as short summaries of the database, they are indeed interpretable, especially if we imagine that Gibbs is a poet--an eighteenth-century scribbler of nonsense with a cultivated interest in metaphors for the mind. His poetic lines are a version of those we find in the cluster trees. While they may appear meaningless, we find, with practice, that we can give a gloss or a paraphrase for all varieties of nonsense. The sixth line--`stamp the resembling and regiment making it reason and it had that goodness inlet unfruitful'--has a decidedly epistemological flavor and is available for interpretation. Let us improvise some punctuation and syntax and borrow a stop word or two as necessary. First, we note that

Impact of implicit assumptions

stamping metaphors are used by eighteenth-century philosophers to link entities to sense impressions. (`Impression' is a notable metaphor for the mind that connotes anything from wax tablets to printing presses.) In the Essay on Human Understanding, Locke distinguishes between the primary qualities of `Solidity, Extension, Figure, and Mobility', which are `utterly inseparable from the Body' (II.viii.9) and the secondary qualities (`Colours, Sounds, Tasts, etc.') `which in truth are nothing in the Objects themselves, but Powers to produce various Sensations in us by their primary Qualities' (II.viii.10).9 From these disorderly `unfruitful' resembling impressions which pour through an inlet into the mind, we draft a mental `regiment'. The stamped impressions of sense are recruited as material for the reason or the understanding to operate upon (the line may now have a Kantian flavor). The third line, `in to scholar the seat lest grown must had sung shall man mind sciences inclination' could almost serve as an epigraph to this essay. We leave it to our readers to construct a complete interpretation of the line on their own. Reading these lines makes for a parlor game or a display of interpretive virtuosity. In truth, what is not interpretable by the literary critic? Nature is a divine book, legible to all who will read it, and, likewise, any text may be naturalized by the efforts of interpretation. The interpreter approaches the artifact and discovers it to be patterned, pregnant with purposiveness, meaningful in advance of his or her expectations. Yet, it would be difficult to present these new texts to the community of literary scholars as hard evidence for scholarly research. Thus, this extreme case serves as a cautionary example. Interpretability alone cannot be our guide in evaluating results from data mining methods applied in humanities. The literary critic--flying the banner `mine'--can interpret anything, but such interpretation may well be another name for overfitting the data.

before a new finding is considered to be a trustworthy result. But when we cross discipline, these standards must be revisited. In collaboration, we discover an opportunity to examine our practices. Willard McCarty writes, `Computational form, which accepts only that which can be told explicitly and precisely' proves `useful for isolating . . . tacit and inchoate' knowledge (p. 256). Collaborators are forced to set out a program in detail, one that is mutually comprehensible but also one that delivers results that are simultaneously meaningful in two disciplines.

6.1 Technology as proof
The temptation in applying machine learning methods to humanities data is to interpret a computed result as some form of proof or determinate answer. In this case, the validity of the evidence lies inherent in the technology. This can be problematic when the methods are treated as a black box, a critic ex machina. Indeed, we will not devise better methods or better models that sever theory from observation. Circularity is, if we believe Gadamer, at the heart of interpretation. The act of interpretation begins in `fore-projection' and we bring our linguistic competence, theories, sense of history to bear on whatever text it is we choose to read. The critic who works with a computer scientist will not escape the hermeneutic circle by employing an automated technique to identify patterns that somehow lie await in the texts. But perhaps this circularity may be framed as a strength and not a weakness of computational methods. Steve Ramsay, for one, explicitly celebrates circularity and warns the literary critic that there are no scientific solutions to interpretive problems. Ramsay's is an admirable embrace of the ineluctable.10 Ramsay writes, software `cannot be neutral . . . since there is no level at which assumption disappears. It must rather, assert its utter lack of neutrality with candor, so that the demonstrably non-neutral act of interpretation can occur' (p. 182). He describes his graphs not as `objective data' useful for adjudicating some `humanistic problem'--they are not `concrete evidence to

6 Conclusion: Standards of Automated Evidence
Literary critics and machine learning practitioners both have well-defined standards that must be met

support or refute hypotheses or interpretations' (Ramsay, 2005, p. 183). Machine learning delivers new texts--trees, graphs, and scatter-grams--that are not any easier to make sense of than the original texts used to make them. The critic who is not concerned to establish the deep structure of a genre or validate a correlation between metaphor and ideology, will delight in the proliferation of unstable, ambiguous texts. The deferral of meaning from one computergenerated instance to the next is fully Derridean.

reasonably used to explain away the importance of a negative result. The opportunity for self-reflection is welcome. We read Lakoff against the political history of the eighteenth century. Competing results offer opportunities to make decisions between competing explanations.

6.3 Recommendations for best practice
We believe the standards of evidence for the use of data mining in the humanities to be, if anything, more difficult to meet than in data mining for the sciences where there is a clear objective function. Our task is one of quantifying ambiguities and subtleties. To this end, we hope that the community of those involved in data mining for the humanities will converge on a consensus for best practices in this work. We contribute to this collective conversation with the following set of recommendations. Needless to say, these are in addition to the standards of best practice in data mining (such as the use of separate training and testing data, etc.) that are laid out carefully by Salzberg (1997). 6.3.1 Make assumptions explicit Literary data mining is most often a collaborative effort between individuals coming from different backgrounds, who, perhaps, share little common vocabulary. It is incumbent on both literary scholars and data mining experts to make all of their underlying assumptions about the text and its representations explicit. It is these most basic conversations about the nature of a text that we have found most edifying in our collaborations. 6.3.2 Use multiple representations, methodologies As we have seen in the case study reported here, different representations of the data highlight different aspects of a text and address different issues in interpretation. Because there can be no single `best' representation or experimental design, it is important for researchers to consider multiple viewpoints and not be content with a single early result.

6.2 Hypothesis testing
But what of the critics who are interested in privileging explanation over interpretation? When data mining methods are used for hypothesis testing, we must deal with questions of proof explicitly. How much signal is needed before we consider the experiment to agree with a hypothesis? Clearly, demanding 100% accuracy in the prediction of political affiliation based on metaphorical usage seems to be too strict a test--but where do we draw the line? And what are we to make of partial results, such as the ones in our case study, which show a statistically significant signal that is far from 100% reliable? Obviously, when the results of an experiment agree with the hypothesis, we cannot consider this to be a proof of the hypothesis, only a piece of evidence in its support. Furthermore, we must take care to consider if the connections between data and labels may be coincidental--as appeared to be the case in our cross-validation by metaphor, where the connection found by the classifiers seemed to be more strongly influenced by the connections between individual author identity and metaphorical usage. Likewise, when the results of an experiment disagree with the hypothesis, we cannot consider this to invalidate the hypothesis--these results are only a piece of evidence in the argument against it. And we must consider the possible objections: were the connections not found because the wrong feature space was used, or because the wrong learning method was used, or because insufficient data was employed? Any of these objections could be

Impact of implicit assumptions

6.3.3 Report all trials In data mining for the humanities, results may differ significantly for alternative representations or methodologies. It is important to report all results to present the complexities and underlying issues of the data at hand, rather than cherry picking one or two results from a set. Indeed, in humanities data mining, `failed' experiments can often be even more informative than `successful' ones. We refer the reader again to Ramsay's interest in anomalous and outlier results.11 6.3.4 Make data available and methods reproducible Experimental results should be verifiable by independent researchers. In general, this means data should either be made available to other researchers upon request, or preferably be posted in an online archive. Even when copyright restrictions make full data disclosure impossible, it may be possible to distribute obscured forms of the data, such as feature vectors rather than full text. 6.3.5 Engage in peer review of methodology As a community, we must foster critical discussion not only of text and literary interpretation, but also of experimental method and interpretation of results. In many ways, this is a more difficult burden of proof than is required in scientific data mining, where objective performance measures allow clear comparisons of approaches. As a community, we need to find an articulate consensus on meaningful standards for experimental evidence provided by data mining. Ultimately, the goal of data mining in the humanities is not to turn the study of literature into some sort of pseudo-science, but rather to enable scholars to highlight the varying facets of complex issues. We reject overly simplistic interpretations of any form, whether drawn directly from a text or from experimental results. We believe the work of data mining in the humanities is most often about highlighting ambiguities and conflicts that lie latent within the text itself, and it is to be expected that such work will often stall out in inconclusiveness. Indeed, the virtue of automated analysis is not the ready delivery of objective truth, but instead the more

profound virtue of bringing us up short, of disturbing us in our preconceptions and our basic assumptions so that we can exist, if only for a moment, in uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts. Should we learn to forestall interpretation we may come to revise our prejudices, theories, and fore-projections in terms of what emerges.

Notes
1 In an essay on the state of the art, published in the 1993 collection The Digital Word, David S. Miall discusses a representative moment of foundational anxiety. The year was 1978. Klaus Schmidt attacked the KWIC concordance itself, that early darling of computer-assisted textual analysis. A concordance is

11

not useful, complained Schmidt, to the scholar who hopes to make a discovery, because the concordance demands of the scholar that he already know what he is looking for. Its efficacy as a textual instrument lies in its locating moments in the text the user of the concordance knows he wants to find. `Mine' is a key feature in Dickinson's erotics, or so the classifier teaches us. One wonders who is in on the joke here: the Dickinson scholar? Kirschenbaum? the reader? The classifier? After all, the machine identifies `mine' as an erotic word! See Matthew Kirschenbaum's `Poetry Patterns, and Provocation: The NORA Project. The Valve: A Literary Organ, 12 January 2006. See also the more formal report authored by Kirschenbaum and others (Plaisant et al., 2006). Gadamer locates the part-whole dialectic in the earliest hermeneutic writings: `the whole of Scripture guides the understanding of individual passages: and again this whole can be reached only through the cumulative understanding of individual passages. This circular relationship between the whole and the parts is not new. It was already known to classical rhetoric, which compares perfect speech with the organic body, with the relationship between head and limbs' (Gadamer, 2000). Moretti also lists Black Forest Village Stories and I Malavoglia as examples. This sort of unsubtle ground truth labeling is one area that may make the literary scholar uneasy. Although in this article we use this framework for simplicity, it is worth noting that there are machine learning methods capable of dealing with labels that are not strictly black-and-white, such as probabilistic labelings. When there are more than two classes of data, a multiclass SVM is used, which essentially consists of several pairwise classifiers (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002). One thinks also of William Burroughs' cut-up method or Gilles Deleuze's `pick up' procedure. Primary qualities are like that which produces them; secondary qualities are not (II.viii.15). In his essay `In Praise of Pattern', Ramsay finds an opportunity to go on a `fishing expedition' in which after discovering a new and interesting technology he struggled to find a way to apply it (Ramsay, 2005). And we look forward to forthcoming papers co-authored by Shlomo Argamon, Mark Olsen, Russel Horton, Charles Cooney, and Sterling Stein that, likewise, celebrate moments of mis-classification.

A man who wants the truth becomes a scientist; a man who wants to give free play to his subjectivity may become a writer; but what should a man do who wants something in between? Robert Musil, The Man without Qualities

The title of this short book deserves a few words of explanation. To begin with, this is an essay on literary history: literature, the old territory (more or less), unlike the drift towards other discourses so typical of recent years. But within that old territory, a new object of study: instead of concrete, individual works, a trio of artificial constructsgraphs, maps, and trees-in which the reality of the text undergoes a process of deliberate reduction and abstraction. 'Distant reading', I have once called this type of approach;' where distance is however not an obstacle, but a specific form ofknowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection. Shapes, relations, structures. Forms. Models. From texts to models, then; and models drawn from three disciplines with which literary studies have had little or no interaction: graphs

from quantitative history, maps from geography, and trees from evolutionary theory. The distant reason for these choices lies in my Marxist formation, which was profoundly influenced by Galvano DellaVolpe, and entailed therefore (in principle, if not always in practice) a great respect for the scientific spirit. And so, while recent literary theory was turning for inspiration towards French and German metaphysics, I kept thinking that there was actually much more to be learned from the natural and the social sciences. This book is a result of that conviction, and also, in its small way, an attempt to open a new front of discussion. Finally, these three models are indeed, as the subtitle intimates, abstract. But their consequences are on the other hand extremely concrete: graphs, maps, and trees place the literary field literally in front of our eyes-and show us how little we still know about it. It is a double lesson, of humility and euphoria at the same time: humility for what literary history has accomplished so far (not enough), and euphoria for what still remains to be done (a lot). Here, the methodology of the book reveals its pragmatic ambition: for me, abstraction is not an end in itself, but a way to widen the domain of the literary historian, and enrich its internal problematic. How this may be done, is what I will try to explain.'

Before the advent of the Annales, Krzysztof Pomian once wrote,

Pomian speaks in the past tense here, as is probably accurate in the case of social history, but certainly not for its literary counterpart, where the collector of rare and curious works, that do not repeat themselves, exceptional-and which close reading makes even more exceptionaL by emphasizing the uniqueness of exactly this word and this sentence here--is still by far the dominant figure. But what would happen if literary historians, too, decided to 'shift their gaze' (Pomian again) 'from the extraordinary to the everyday, from exceptional events to the large mass of facts'? What literature would we find, in 'the large mass offacts'? All questions that occurred to me some years ago, when the study of national bibliographies made me realize what a minimal fraction

of the literary field we all work on: a canon of two hundred novels, for instance, sounds very large for nineteenth-century Britain (and is much larger than the current one), but is still less than one per cent of the novels that were actually published: twenty thousand, thirty, more, no one really knows-and close reading won't help here, a novel a day every day of the year would take a century or so ... And it's not even a matter of time, but of method: a field this large cannot be understood by stitching together separate bits of knowledge about individual cases, because it isn't a sum of individual cases: it's a collective system, that should be grasped as such, as a whole-and the graphs that follow are one way to begin doing this. Or as Fernand Braude! put it in the lecture on history he gave to his companions in the German prison camp near Lubeck:
An incredible number of dice, always rolling, dominate and determine each individual existence: uncertainty, then, in the realm of individual history; but in that of collective history ... simplicity and consistency. History is indeed 'a poor little conjectural science' when it selects individuals as its objects ... but much more rational in its procedures and results, when it examines groups and repetitions."

A more rational literary history. That is the idea.

I

The quantitative approach to literature can take several different forms-from computational stylistics to thematic databases, book history, and more. For reasons of space, I will here limit myself to book history, building on work originally done by McBurney, Beasley, Raven, Garside and Block for Britain; Angus, Mylne and Frautschi for France; Zwicker for Japan; Petersen for Denmark; Ragone for Italy;
z

Marti-Lopez and Santana for Spain; Joshi for India; and Griswold for Nigeria. And I mention these names right away because quantitative work IS truly cooperation: not only in the pragmatic sense that It takes forever to gather the data, but because such data are ideally mdependent from any individual researcher, and can thus be shared by ~thers, and combined in more than one way. Figurer (overleaf), whiCh ch~rts the take~off of the novel in Britain, Japan, Italy, Spain and Nigena, IS a case m pomt. See how similar those shapes are: five countries, three continents, over two centuries apart, and it's really the same pattern, the same old metaphor of the 'rise' of the novel come alive: in twenty years or so (in Britain, 1720-40; Japan, 174565; Italy, r82o-4o; Spain, r845 to early r86os; Nigeria, 196s-8o), the graph leaps from five-ten new titles per year, which means one new novel every month or two, to one new novel per week. And at this point, the horizon of novel-reading changes. As long as only a handful of new titles are published each year, I mean, novels remain unreliable products, that disappear for long stretches of time, and cannot re~lly command the loyalty of the reading public; they are commodities, yes-but commodities still waiting for a fully developed market. A new novel per week, by contrast, is already the great capitahst oxymoron of the regular novelty: the unexpected that is produced with such efficiency and punctuality that readers become unable to do without it. The novel 'becomes a necessity of life', to paraphrase the title of a book by William Gilmore-Lehne, and the jer' emiads that Immediately multiply around it-novels make readers lazy, stupid, dissolute, insane, insubordinate: exactly like films two centuries later-are the clearest sign of its symbolic triumph.

of new novels in Britain between r7ro and r85o (figure 2). Here, three phases seem to stand out, each subdivided into a first period of rapid growth and a second one of stabilization, and each modifYing in a specific way the social role of the novel. The first phase, from1720 to around 1770, is the one discussed above: a leap in 1720-40, and a consolidation in the following decades. In the second phase, which runs from 1770 to around r82o, the further increase in the number of new titles induces for its part a drastic reorientation of audiences towards the present. Up to then, I mean, the 'extensive' reading so typical of the novel--reading many texts once and superficially, rather than a few texts often and intensely--would easily outgrow the yearly output of titles, forcing readers to turn to the past for (much of) their entertainment: all sorts of reprints and abridge· ments of eighteenth-century bestsellers, British as well as foreign,

plus the old, and even the few ancient classics of the genre. But as the total of new novels doubles, compared to the previous phase--So in 1788; 91 in 1796; m in 1808-the popularity of old books suddenly collapses, and novelistic audiences tum resolutely (and irreversibly) towards the current season.' The third phase, which begins around 1820, and which unfortunately I can only follow for the first thirty years, is the one in which the internal composition of the market changes. So far, the typical reader of novels had been a 'generalist' -someone 'who reads absolutely anything, at random', as Thibaudet was to write with a touch of contempt in Le liseur de romans.4 Now, however, the growth of the market creates all sorts of niches for 'specialist' readers and genres (nautical tales, sporting novels, school stories, mysteres): the books aimed at urban workers in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, or at boys, and then girls, in the following generation, are simply the most visible instances of this larger process, which culminates at the turn of the century in the super-niches of detective fiction and then science fiction. Abstract models for literary history ... and we certainly have abstraction here: Pamela, The Monk, The Wild Irish Girl, Persuasion, Oliver Twist-where are they? five tiny dots in the graph of figure 2, indistinguishable from all others. But graphs are not really models; they are not simplified, intuitive versions ofa theoretical structure in the way maps . and (especially) evolutionary trees will be in the next two chapters.
3 'In Italy,' writes Giovanni Ragone, 'in the first twenty years of the nineteenth century virtually all the bestsellers of the previous century disappear', 'ltalia r8rs-r87o', in It romanzo, vol. III, pp. 343-54. A similar shift seems to occur in France, where, however, the caesura of the revolution offers a very strong altema~ tive explanation. The 'pastness of the past' is of course the key message of the two genres-gothic, and then historical novels-most responsible for the turn towards the present. 'Albert Thibaudet, Illettore di romanzi [r925], Napoli 2000, p. 49·

Quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations, I said earlier, and that is of course also its limit: it provides data, not interpretation. That figure 2 shows a first 'rise' (when the novel becomes a necessity of life), and then a second (the shift from the past to the present), and then a third (the multiplication of market niches), seems to me a good account of the data, but is certainly far from inevitable. Quantitative data can tell us when Britain produced one new novel per month, or week, or day, or hour for that matter, but where the significant turning points lie along the continuum-and why-is something that must be decided on a different basis.

A-multiple--rise of the novel. But with an interesting twist, which is particularly visible in the japanese case of figure 3 (overleaf): after the rise from one novel per month in the mid-1740s to one per week twenty years later (and even more in the following years: between 1750 and 1820, in fact, many more novels are published in japan than in Britain; a fact which deserves a good explanation!)-several equally rapid downturns occur in 1780-90, the 1810s to the 183os, and in 1860-70. The fall of the novel. And the reason behind the downturns seems to be always the same: politics-a direct, virulent censorship· dnring the Kansei and Tempo periods, and an indirect influence in the years leading up to the Meiji Restoration, when there was no specific repression of the book trade, and the crisis was thus probably due to a more general dissonance between the rhythm of political crises and the writing of novels. It's the same in Denmark during the Napoleonic wars (figure 4, overleaf), or in France and Italy (better, Milan) in comparable situations (figure 5, overleaf): after 1789, the publication of French novels drops about 8o per cent; after the first Risorgimento war, the Milanese downturn is around 90 per cent, with only 3 novels published in the course of 1849, against 43 in 1842.

notwithstanding its greater institutional stability. The American and the Napoleonic wars may well be behind the slumps of 1775-83 and r8ro-r7 (which are clearly visible in figure 2), write Raven and Garside in their splendid bibliographic studies; but then they add to the political factor 'a decade of poorly produced novels', 'reprints', the possible 'greater relative popularity ... of other fictional forms', 'a backlash against low fiction', the high cost of paper ... ' And as possible causes multiply, one wonders: what are we trying to explain here-two unrelated individual events, or two moments in a recurring pattern of ups and downs? Because if the downturns are individual events, then looking for individual causes (Napoleon, reprints, the cost of paper, whatever) makes perfect sense; but if they are parts of a pattern, then what we must explain is the pattern as a whole, not just one of its phases. The whole pattern; or, as some historians would say, the whole cycle: 'An increasingly clear idea has emerged ... of the multiplicity of time', writes Braude! in the essay on longue durie:
Traditional history, with its concern for the short time span, for the indi~ vidual and the event, has long accustomed us to the headlong, dramatic, breathless rush of its narrative ... The new economic and social history puts cyclical movement in the forefront of its research ... large sections of the past, ten, twenty, fifty years at a stretch ... Far beyond this ... we find a history capable of traversing even greater distances ... to be measured in centuries ... the long, even the very long time span, the

Event, cycle, longue duree: three time frames which have fared very unevenly in literary studies. Most critics are perfectly at ease with the first one, the circumscribed domain of the event and of the individual case; most theorists are at home at the opposite end of the temporal spectrum, in the very long span of nearly unchanging structures. But the middle level has remained somewhat unexplored by literary historians; and it's not even that we don't work within that time frame, it's that we haven't yet fully understood its specificity: the fact, I mean, that cycles constitute temporary structures within the historical flow. That is, after all, the hidden logic behind Brandel's tripartition: the short span is all flow and no structure, the longue duree all structure and no flow, and cycles are the--unstable-border country between them. Structures, because they introduce repetition in history, and hence regularity, order, pattern; and temporary, because they're short (ten, twenty, fifty years, this depends on the theory). Now, 'temporary structures' is also a good definition for-genres: morphological arrangements that last in time, but always only for some time. Janus-like creatures, with one face turned to history and the other to form, genres are thus the true protagonists of this middle layer of literary history-this more 'rationaf layer where flow and form meet. It's the regularity of figures 7 and 8 (overleaf), with their three waves of epistolary novels from 1760 to 1790, and then gothic novels from 1790 to r8r5, and then historical novels from r8r5 to the r84os. Each wave produces more or less the same number of novels per year, and lasts the same 25-30 years, and each also rises only after the previous wave has begun to ebb away (see how the up- and downward trends intersect around 1790 and r8r5). 'The new form makes its appearance to replace an old form that has outlived its artistic usefulness', writes Shklovsky, and the decline of a ruling genre seems indeed here to be the necessary precondition for its successor's takeoff. Which may explain those odd 'latency periods' in the early history of genres: Pamela is published in 1740, and The Castle of Otranto in 1764, but very few epistolary or gothic novels are written until r760

and r790 respectively. Why the lag? Almost certainly, because as long as a hegemonic form has not lost its 'artistic usefulness', there is not much that a rival form can do: there can always be an exceptional text, yes, but the exception wUl not change the system. It's only when Ptolemaic astronomy begins to generate one 'monstrosity' after another, writes Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, that 'the time comes to give a competitor a chance'-and the same is true here: a historical novel written in r8oo, such as Castle Rackrent (or in r8o5, like Waverley's abandoned first draft) simply didn't have the incredible opportunity to reshape the literary field that the collapse of the gothic offered Waverley in r8r4- 7

A few more words on why a form loses its 'artistic usefulness' and disappears. For Shklovsky, the reason is the purely inner dialectic of art, which begins in ere· ative estrangement, and ends in stale automatism: 'Each art form travels down

the inevitable road from birth to death; from seeing and sensory perception, when every detail in the object is savoured and relished, to mere recognition, when form becomes a dull epigone which our senses register mechanically, a piece of merchandise not visible even to the buyer.' {The passage is from an article collected. in The Knight's Move, and is quoted by Victor Erlich in Russian Formalism, New Haven 1955, p. 252.) This journey 'down the inevitable road from birth to death' can however also be explained by focusing, not so much on the relationship between the 'young' and the 'old' versions of the same form, but rather on that between the form and its historical context: a genre exhausts its potentialities-and the time comes to give a competitor a chance-when its inner form is no longer capable of representing the most significant aspects of contemporary reality. At which point, either the genre loses its form under the impact of reality, thereby disintegrating, or it turns its back to reality in the name ofform, becoming a 'dull epigone' indeed. (I develop this point in the appendix to the new edition of The Way of the World, "'A useless longing for myself': The crisis of the European Bildungsroman, r898-r914', London 2000.) But we will soon see another, more draconian explanation for the disappearance of forms.

seem indeed to follow a rather regular 'life-cycle', as some economists would call it. These genres-or all genres? Is this wave-like pattern a sort of hidden pendulum ofliterary history? Here, the gathering of data is obviously crucial, and I decided to rely entirely on other people's work: since we are all eager to find what we are looking for, using the evidence gathered by other scholars, with completely different research programmes, is always a good corrective to one's desires. So, first Brad Pasanek, at Stanford, and then I, consulted over a hundred studies of British genres between 1740 and 1900; there were some dubious cases, of course, and some (not very significant) disagreements in periodization;8 and although this is still very much work-in-progress, especially at the two ends of the temporal spectrum, the forty-four genres of figure 9 provide a large enough set to support some reflections. Forty-four genres over r6o years; but instead of finding one new genre every four years or so, as a random distribution would have it, over two thirds of them cluster in just thirty years, divided in six major bursts of creativity: the late r76os, early 1790s, late r82os, r8so, early r87os, and mid-late r88os. And the genres also tend to disappear in clusters: with the exception of the turbulence ofr79o-r8ro, a rather regular changing of the guard takes place, where half a dozen genres quickly leave the scene, as many move in, and then remain in place for twenty-five years or so. Instead of changing all the time and a little at a time, then, the system stands still for decades, and is then 'punctuated' by brief bursts of invention: forms change once, rapidly, across the board, and then repeat themselves for two-three decades: 'normal literature', we could call it, in analogy to Kuhn's normal

When specialists disagreed, I always opted for the periodization arising out of the more convincing morphological argument: in the case ofindustrial novels, for instance, I followed Gallagher rather than Cazamian, although the latter's perio· dization ofi83o-5o would have fitted my argument much better than Gallagher's r832-67.

science. Or think ofJauss's 'horizon of expectations': a metaphor we tend to evoke only 'negatively' (that is to say, when a text transcends the given horizon), but which these graphs present instead, 'positively', for what it is: figures 7-8 showing how difficult It actually IS to transcend the hegemonic horizon, figure 9 presentlng the multiple horizons active at any given moment, and so on.

This, then, is where those 25-30 years come from: generations. Not a concept I am very fond of, actually, but the only one that seems to make se;:tse of figure 9· And indeed, in Mannheim's great essay of 1927, the best evidence for his thesis comes precisely from the aesthetic sphere: 'a rhythm in the sequence of generations', he writes, following Mentre's Les generations sociales, published a few years earlier,
is far more apparent in the realm ofthe siries lib res-free human groupings such as salons and literary circles-than in the realm of the institutions which for the most part lay down a lasting pattern of behaviour, eithe; by pres~riptions or by the organization of collective undertakings, thus preventing the new generation from showing its originality ... The aesthetic sphere is perhaps the most appropriate to reflect overall changes of mental c1imate.9

VI

Normal literature remains in place for twenty-five years or so ... But where does this rhythm come from? Shklovsky's hypothesis (however modified) cannot explain it, because the connexion between the decline of an old form and the rise of a new one implies nothing about the regularity of the replacement. And widespread regularity: not just the few hegemonic genres, but (almost) all genres active at any given time seem to arise and disappear together accordmg to some hidden rhythm. The simultaneity of the turnover, at first sight so uncanny, is probably the key to the solution. When one genre replaces another, ifs reasonable to assume that the cause is internal to the two genres, and historically specific: amorous epistolary fiction being ill-equipped to capture the traumas of the revolutionary years, say-and gothiC novels being particularly good at it. But when several genres disappear together from the literary field, and then another group, and so on, then the reason has to be different, because all these forms cannot have run independently and simultaneously into insoluble problems-it would be simply too much of a coincidence. The causal mechanism must thus be external to the genres, and common to all: like a sudden, total change of their ecosystem. Which is to say: a change of their audience. Books survive if they are read and disappear if they aren't: and when an entire generic system vanishes at once, the likeliest explanation is that its readers vanished at once.

Overall changes ofthe mental climate: the five, six shifts in the British novelistic field between 1740 and 1900. But since people are born every day, not every twenty-five years, on what basis can the biological continuum be segmented into discrete units? Mannheim again:
Whether a new generation style emerges every year, every thirty, every hundred years, or whether it emerges rhythmically at all, depends entirely on

the trigger action of the social and cultural process ... We shall therefore speak of a generation as an actuality only where a concrete bond is created between members of a generation by their being exposed to the social and intellec~al symptoms of a process of dynamic destabilization. 10

A bond due to a process of dynamic destabilization; and one who was eighteen in 1968 understands. But again, this cannot possibly explain the regularity of generational replacement, unless one assumes-absurdly-that the 'destabilizations' themselves occur punctually every twenty-five or thirty years. And so, I close on a note

of perplexity: faute de mieux, some kind of generational mechanism seems the best way to account for the regularity of the novelistic cycle-but 'generation' is itself a very questionable concept. Clearly, we must do better."

Normal literature remains in place for a generation or so ... It's the central group of figure ro, which rearranges the forty-four genres according to their duration, and where about two thirds of them last indeed between 23 and 35 years." The one large exception is formed by those genres-nine years, ten, twelve-on the left end of the spec· trum: why so short-lived? Almost certainly, because of politics again: Jacobin, anti- Jacobin, evangelical novels around the turn ofthe century,
" A possible solution: at some point, a particularly significant 'destabilization' gives rise to a clearly defined generation, which occupies centre stage for 20-30 years, attracting within its orbit, and shaping after its mould, slightly younger or older individuals. Once biological age pushes this generation to the periphery of the cultural system, there is suddenly room for a new generation, which comes into being simply because it can, destabilization or not; and so on, and on. A regular series would thus emerge even without a 'trigger action' for each new generation: once the generational clock has been set in motion, it will run its course-for some time at least. (This is in fact Mentre's approach to the problem, especially in the long chapter in which he sketches an unbroken series of generations throughout French literature from ISIS to rgrs.) n A first look at French literature from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century suggests that most of its narrative genres have a similar 30-year span: pastoral and heroic novels, the nouvelle historique, romans galants and contes philosophiques, sentimental novels, the Bildungsroman, the roman gai, the two main phases ('heroic' and 'sentimental') of the roman-feuilleton . .. On the other hand, Sandra Guardini Vasconcelos and other Brazilian literary historians have pointed out that when a country imports most of its novels, the regular turnover of the AngloFrench generations is replaced by a much more accelerated and possibly uneven tempo. If they are right-and I think they are-then the Western European case would once more be the exception rather than the rule of world literature.

Chartist and religious narratives in the r84os, New Woman novels in the r89os ... And as often happens with politics and the novel, the outcome is a string of explicit ideological declarations: jacobin novels trying to reform their villains by 'discussion and reasoning', as Gary Kelly puts it; Right Reason, adds Marilyn Butler in Jane Austen and the War of Ideas: a 'puzzling' choice, she goes on, the great 'missed opportunity' of the jacobin novel as a form. Missed opportunity, yes, but puzzling, perhaps not: if a novel wants to engage the political sphere directly, a series of unambiguous statements, however narratively dull, is a perfectly rational choice. And then, ideological exchanges are an easy way to capture Braudel's 'dramatic rush of the event': to tum a book into A tale of the times, A tale of the day, The philosophy of the day, to quote some typical 179os subtitles. But the conjunction of course works both ways: if what most attracts readers is the drama of the day, then, once the day is over, so is the novel ...

Why did most British genres last 25-30 years, then, but some of them only ten? Because these 'political' forms subordinated narrative logic to the tempo of the short span, I have conjectured, and thus they also disappeared with the short span; and I hope the answer sounds plausible. But the real point, here, is less the specific answer, than the total heterogeneity ofproblem and solution: to make sense of quantitative data, I had to abandon the quantitative universe, and tum to morphology: evoke form, in order to explain figures. Here, the figures of the literary market. But when I studied the international impact of American filrris, I encountered exactly the same problematic: in the sample decade (1986-95), comedies amounted to zo% of the top box office hits within the United States, whereas elsewhere, as figure n shows, they were a lot less successful (especially in Asia and in the Mediterranean).'' The figures were crystal clear. But if one then

wondered why this was so-why, in other words, comedies were so much harder to export tha n, say, action · fil ms-percentages offered no help, and the explanation had to be sought once again in the realm of form: as contemporary comedies make large use of jokes, which are often lost m translation, American comedies are quite simply a lot ~ess funny m japanese or Egyptian or Spanish than in English. (Not ;r nothmg, the great international age of comic films-Chaplin, eaton, Uoyd, Laurel and Hardy-coincided with silent cinema.)'4

Quantification poses the problem, then, and form offers the solution. But let me add: if you are lucky. Because the asymmetry of a quantitative explanandum and a qualitative explanans leaves you often with a perfectly clear problem-and no idea of a solution. In _'Planet Hollywood', for instance, it turned out that absolutely all Itahan box office hits of the sample decade were comedies; why that was so, however, was completely unclear. I felt I had to say something, so I presented an 'explanation', and NLR indulgently printed it; but it was silly of me, because the most interesting aspect of those data was that I had found a problem for which I had absolutely no solutwn. N:id problems without a solution are exactly what we n:'ed m a field hke ours, where we are used to asking only those questions for whrch we already have an answer. 'I have noticed,' says Brecht's Herr Keuner, 'that we put many people off our teaching because we have an answer to everything. Could we not, in the interest of propaganda, draw up a list of the questions that appear to us completely unsolved?'

Two brief theoretical conclusions. The first is again on the cycle as the hidden thread ofliterary history. 'For the elevation ofthe novel to occur', writes William Warner in Licensing Entertainment, 'the novel of amorous intrigue must ... disappear'; it is 'the Great Gender Shift' of the mid-eighteenth century, adds April Alliston: the disappearance of earlier fiction by women writers, with the related increase in the number of male novelists. And it's all true, except for the article: the shift? The third quarter of the nineteenth century, write Tuchman and Fo_rtin in Edging Women Out, was 'the period of invasion' of the novelistic field by male authors, who eventually 'edge out' their female competitors. ' 5
·s William B. Warner, Licensing Entertainment. The Elevation of Novel Reading in Britain, r685-r750, Berkeley 1998, p. 44; April Alliston, 'Love in Excess', in Il

But, clearly, a mid-Victorian 'invasion' presupposes a reversal of the gender shift of the 1740s. And, in fact, this is what the historical record show,s: if between 1750 and r78o, as a result of the initial shift, men publish indeed twice as many novels as women, in the late r78os a second shift reverses the gender ratio, as one can see in Garside's breakdown for a slightly later period (figure 12, overleaf), in which women novelists (among them Burney, Radcliffe, Edgeworth, Austen) remain the majority until a third shift occurs, around r82o, towards male writers (Scott; then Bulwer; Dickens, Thackeray), to be followed by a fourth shift back to women in mid-century (the Brontes, Gaskell, Braddon, Eliot), and then by a fifth one-the 'edging out'in the r87os. Similar data are beginning to emerge for France, Spain, the us, and it's fascinating to see how researchers are convinced that they are all describing something unique (the gender shift, the elevation of the novel, the gentrification, the invention of high and low, the feminization, the sentimental education, the invasion ... ), whereas in all likelihood they are all observing the same comet that keeps crossing and recrossing the sky: the same literary cyde, where gender and genre are probably in synchrony with each other-a generation of military novels, nautical tales, and historical novels ala Scott attracting male writers, one of domestic, provincial and sensation novels attracting women writers, and so on. Now, let me be clear, saying that these studies describe the return of the same literary cycle is not an objection: quite the opposite, my thesis depends on their findings, and it even corroborates tlrem somehow, by finding the common mechanism which is at work in all those instances. But it's also true that if one reframes individual instances as moments of a cycle, then the nature of the questions changes: 'Events don't interest Lucien Febvre for what in them is unique', writes Pomian, but 'as units in a series, which reveal the conjunctural variations in . . . a conflict that remains constant throughout the period.'' 6

Variations in a conflict that remains constant: this is what emerges at the level of the cycle-and if the conflict remains constant, then the point is not who prevails in this or that skirmish, but exactly the opposite: no victory is ever definitive, neither men nor women writers 'occupy' the British novel once and for all, and the form keeps oscillating back and forth between the two groups. And if this sounds like nothing is happening, no, what is happening is the oscillation, which allows the novel to use a double pool of talents and of forms, thereby boosting its productivity, and giving it an edge over its many competitors. But this process can only be glimpsed at the level of the cycle: individual episodes tend, if anything, to conceal it, and only the abstract pattern reveals the true nature of the historical process.'7

Do cycles and genres explain everything, in the history of the novel? Of course not. But they bring to light its hidden tempo, and suggest some questions on what we could call its internal shape. For most literary historians, I mean, there is a categorical difference between 'the novel' and the various 'novelistic (sub)genres': the novel is, so to speak, the substance of the form, and deserves a full general

l7 A comparable oscillation is probably at work between High and Low forms, whose simultaneous existence is a well-known, if often ignored, fact of novel-

istic history: from the Hellenistic beginnings (divided between 'subliterary'
and 'idealized' genres) through the Middle Ages, the seventeenth century (the Bibliotheque Bleue, and aristocratic novels), eighteenth (Warner's pair of 'entertainment' and 'elevation'), nineteenth (fouilletons, railway novels-and 'serious' realism'), and twentieth century (pulp fiction-modernist experiments). Here, too, the strength of the novel is not to be fourid in one of the two positions, but in its rhythmical oscillation between them: the novel is not hegemonic because it makes it into High Culture (it does, yes, but it's so desperately professorial to be awed by this fact), but for the opposite reason: it is never only in High Culture, and it can keep playing on two tables, preserving its double nature, where vulgar and refined are almost inextricable.

theory; subgenres are more like accidents, and their study, however interesting, remains local in character, without real theoretical consequences. The forty-four genres of figure 9, however, suggest a different historical picture, where the novel does not develop as a single entity-where is 'the' novel, there?-but by periodically generating a whole set of genres, and then another, and another ... Both synchronically and diachronically, in other words, the novel is the system of its genres: the whole diagram, not one privileged part of it. Some genres are morphologically more significant, of course, or more popular, or both-and we must account for this: but not by pretending that they are the only ones that exist. And instead, all great theories of the novel have precisely reduced the novel to one basic form only (realism, the dialogic, romance, meta-novels ...); and if the reduction has given them their elegance and power, it has also erased nine tenths ofliterary history. Too much. I began this chapter by saying that quantitative data are useful because they are independent of interpretation; then, that they are challenging because they often demand an interpretation that transcends the quantitative realm; now, most radically, we see them falsify existing theoretical explanations, and ask for a theory, not so much of 'the' novel, but of a whole family of novelistic forms. A theory-of diversity. What this may mean, will be the topic of my third chapter.

The genres Of figures 9 and ro are listed below in the following way: current definition (in capitals); dates of beginning and end; and critical study from which I have drawn the chosen (and not always explicit) periodization. Since both figures are meant as a first panorama of a very large territory, soon to be improved by further work, a few words of caution are in order. First, except for the (rare) cases in which quantitative data or full bibliographies are available, the initial date refers to the genre's first recognizable example rather than to its genuine take-off, which occurs usually several years later; as our knowledge improves, therefore, it is likely that the chronological span of novelistic genres will turn out to be significantly shorter than the one given here. On the other hand, a few genres experience brief but intense revivals decades after their original peak, like the oriental tale in r8r9-25, or the gothic after r885, or the historical novel (more than once). How to account for these Draculaesque reawakenings is a fascinating topic, which however will have to wait for another occasion. Finally, the chart shows neither detective fiction nor science fiction; although both genres achieve their modern form around r89o (Doyle and Wells), and undergo a major change in the 192os, in step with the overall pattern, their peculiar long duration seems to require a different approach.

There is a very simple question about literary maps: what exactly do they do? What do they do that cannot be done with words, that is; because, if it can be done with words, then maps are superfluous. Take Bakhtin's essay on the chronotope: it is the greatest study ever written on space and narrative, and it doesn't have a single map. Carlo Dionisotti's Geografia e storia della letteratura italiana, the same. Raymond Williams's The Country and the City, the same. Henri Lafon's £spaces romanesques du xvnre siecle ... Do maps add anything, to our knowledge ofliterature?

Village stories were a popular British genre of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, peaking with Mary Milford's Our Village, published in five volumes between r824 and r8p. The village was Three Mile Cross, in Berkshire (figure r3, overleaf), a dozen miles south of Reading, on the road to Hampshire; and the road is explicitly foregrounded in Milford's opening sketch; where it also forms the basis for her presentation of the village as one house after another along a 'straggling, winding streef. So you think, 'Yonville',' and imagine

this village of two or three hundred people as a mere site of transit between larger places (Effi Briest: 'no, the Gdansk-Berlin express does not stop here .. .'). Easy. Then you make a map of the book, and everything changes. The twenty-four stories of Milford's first volume, figure r4 shows, arrange themselves in a little solar system, with the village at the centre of the

pattern, and two roughly concentric rings around it. The first ring IS closer to the VIllage, and focuses largely on personal relationships ('Ellen', 'Hannah', 'Cousin Mary'); the second ring, its components more numerous, is at a distance of a couple of miles, and emphasizes natural spectacles ('Frost and thaw', 'Violeting', 'The first primrose'), plus collective events like cricket and maying. But in both cases the road 'from B- to S-', so present at the beginning of the book, has disappeared: narrative space is not linear here, it is circular. Which

is surprising: while mapping nineteenth-century genres for the Atlas of the European Novel I encountered all sorts of shapes-linear trajectories, binary fields, triangulations, multi-polar stories-but never a circular pattern. Where on earth do these rings come from?

II

John Barrell, The Idea of Landscape and the Sense of Place 17J0-184o:
There is a sense in which an open~field parish in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries [which is exactly what the one in Our Village is likeJ could be said to have a different geography according to who was looking at it: thus, for those of its inhabitants who rarely went beyond the parish boundary, the parish itself was so to speak at the centre of the landscape ... For those inhabitants accustomed to moving outside it, however, and for those travellers who passed through it, the parish was ... defined not by some circular system of geography but by a linear one.z

A circular 'system of geography', and a linear one: behind these two perspectives lies the dramatic transformation of rural space produced by parliamentary enclosure, which Barrell has so well visualized in his two maps of Helpston, and where a perceptual (because productive) system in which the village is still largely self-sufficient, and can therefore feel at the centre of'its own' space, is replaced by an abstract grid, within which Helpston becomes just one of the many 'beads' that the various roads will run through (figures rs-r6, overleaf). Against this background, Our Village's spatial pattern becomes at once clearer, and more surprising: by opening with a linear perspective, and then shifting to a circular one, Milford reverses the direction
'John Barrell, The Idea of Landscape and the Sense of Place IJ]0-1840, Cambridge 1972, p. 95· For the sources of the two Helpston maps (figures rs-r6), see pp. 225-7·

of history, making her urban readers (Our Village was published by Whitaker, Ave-Maria-Lane, London) look at the world according to the older, 'centred' viewpoint of an unenclosed village. And the key to this perceptual shift lies in Milford's most typical episode: the country walk. In story after story, the young narrator leaves the village, each time in a different direction, reaches the destinations charted in figure 14, then turns around and goes home. 'When a system is free to spread its energy in space', writes Rudolf Arnheim, 'it sends out its vectors evenly all around, like the rays emanating from a source of light. The resulting ... pattern is the prototype of centric composition.'' Exactly: out of the free movements of Our Village's narrator, spread evenly all around like the petals of a daisy, a circular pattern crystallizes-as it does, we shall see, in all village stories, of which it constitutes the fundamental chronotope. But in order to see this pattern, we must first extract it from the narrative flow, and the only way to do so is with a map. Not, of course, that the map is already an explanation; but at least it shows us that there is something that needs to be explained. One step at a time.

III

A rounded pattern in Helpston before the enclosure; and a rounded pattern in Our Village. But with a difference: in Milford's walks,· Barrell's 'rough circle ... in which the villagers work and move' is rewritten as a· space of leisure rather than work. Slow easy strolls, thoughtless, happy, in the company of a greyhound called May; all around, a countryside full of picturesque natural views, but where very few people are actually doing anything. Decorative: for each page devoted to agricultural labour, there must be twenty on flowers and trees, described with meticulous precision. If urban readers are

The characteristic sense of space which the topography and organization ofan open:field parish created was circular, while the landscape qf parliamentary enclosure expressed a more linear sense ... the village of Helpston is at the centre of the parish, where the three fields of the parish come together: they form around the settlement a rough circle, which represents the area in which the villagers work and move. fohn Barrell, The Idea of Landscape and the Sense of Place 17J0-184o

Priest's idea of a road is that it should be threaded through one village and another like a string through beads: he thinks of the road as in some sense prior to the villages on it, and not of the villages existing separately first.

made to share the village's perception of space, then, it's also true that this space has been thoroughly gentrified; as if Milford had travelled forward in time, and discovered what city-dwellers will want to find in the countryside during a brief weekend visit. Not surprisingly, country walks were by far the most popular part of Our Village, and remained long in print by themselves while the rest was forgotten. Behind the similarity of figures 14 and 15, then, lie very different experiences of social space. Barrell's r8o9 'system of geography' corresponds to the omnipresent, half-submerged culture of daily routines-position of the fields, local paths, perception of distances, horizon-which historians tend to call mentalite, and which is often entwined with the performance of material labour. Milford's neat stylization of rural space, however-with its alchemical transmutation of the 'rough circle' of work into a ring of pleasure-is not menta!ite, but rather ideology: the world-view of a different social actor (an urban visitor), whose movements duplicate the perimeter of rural mentalite, but completely reverse its symbolic associations. A map of ideology emerging from a map of menta!ite, emerging from the material substratum of the physical territory. Granted, things are not always so neat. But when they are, it's interesting.

sanitation'), which in order to reach as many customers as possible are located in 'a few necessarily central points, to be consumed at many scattered points'. 4 The more specialized a service is, the more 'central' it also is, and on this socio-geometrical principle arises the urban hierarchy synthesized by Christaller himself in figure 17. The rule here is simple: around each G-centre of the first rank there is a 'market region' which includes six B-centres of the second rank, with

The formula just used for Milford-a 'stylization' of space-is even more appropriate for Walter Christaller's classic study on Central Places in Southern Germany. Written in the early Thirties, the book explains the geographical distribution of urban centres on the basis of the 'ordering principle, heretofore unrecognized' of the spatial division of labour: towns provide specialized services, writes Christaller ('banking, administration, cultural and spiritual offerings [church, school, theatre, professional and business organizations],

Walter Christaller, Central Places in Southern Germany [1933], Englewood Cliffs, 1966, p. 20. Christaller's model presupposes an 'isotropic' space, where movement can occur with equal ease in every direction; this is of course a theoretical abstraction, whose empirical validity is limited to homogeneous agricultural flatlands ~like indeed much of Southern Germany). The assumption of an isotropic space IS the common denominator bet\.veen Christaller's theory and the structure of village narratives; I briefly discuss the problematic nature of this idea in footnote 12 below.

fewer and less specialized services; around each B-centre there are six K-centres of the third rank, and so on, until, at the very bottom of the hierarchy, we encounter ... Our Village: the 'central region of the lowest order', as Christaller calls it, whose radius (2-3 kilometres) is exactly the same as one of the book's country walks. And figure r8, Christaller-like, visualizes the services offered by Mitford's village, and by the other urban centres mentioned in her book. In the village: shoemaker, blacksmith, carpenter, mason; in London and the other towns: French teachers, hatters, fashionable tailors, horse races. Serious daily needs versus frivolous superfluities: this is Mitford's social geography. Its roots are in one of the most ancient, and most widespread, of narrative forms: the idyll. 'Birth, labour, love, marriage, death', wrote Bakhtin of this longue duree chronotope: 'only a few oflife's basic realities ... a little world ... sufficient unto itself, not linked in any intrinsic way with other places.'' Sufficient unto itself: this is why village stories organize themselves in circular patterns: a circle is a simple, 'naturaf form, which maximizes the proximity of each point to the centre of the 'little world', while simultaneously sealing it off from the vast universe that lies outside its perimeter. 'Sugar and coffee and salt: we wanted nothing else from the outside world', declares proudly the protagonist of a German village story of the same period, Auerbach's Brigitta. But the past tense of that 'wanted' is a sign that the days of the idyll are numbered.

text covers the half century from r76o to r8ro: each year a chapter, where the minister Balwhidder registers the main events in the crowded and often confusing mode of annalistic writing (fires, weddings, wars, births, portents ...), of which the first ten years of the book-charted in figure 19-offer a typical instance. Here, from the still idyllic daily life of Dalmailing, in the bottom left corner ('birth, labour, marriage, death .. .'), we can follow two possible threads through the figure's materials. The first runs through Irville (Irvine), Glasgow, and Edinburgh, and shows the system of central places at work: school in Irville, university in Glasgow, lawyers and doctors in Edinburgh; second-hand news in Irville, and first-hand news in Glasgow; celebration dinner, honeymoon, marble headstone ... As services become more unusual, they move 'up' in the urban hierarchy, and further away from Dalmailing; but since Galt's world is still fundamentally one of simple everyday needs, such services are seldom required, and central places like Edinburgh or London remain barely visible. Extremely visible on the other hand are the many 'novelties' listed in the second column from the left, which reach the parish from the West Indies, the Baltic, and other unspecified places. Behind them is the British empire, of course, but perhaps even more the sheer fact of distance: in Dalmailing, a parrot, Rososolus, or a cockernut (Balwhidder's half-Dutch spelling for coconut) are truly things from another world. Wonders. Or, more prosaically, luxuries; products of long-distance trade which shine for a moment on the horizon of the everyday, leaving behind a sense of incommensurable universes: on the one side birth, labour, marriage, and death; on the other, coconut, Riga balsam, parrot, and Danzig cordial. Home, and the World. But since the world does not really change everyday existence (its wonders are all singular: one donkey, one coconut, one bottle of this and that), the antithesis is at once radical, and totally irrelevant: wonders appear, are admired, and then vanish (except for tea, of course). The world is an astonishing place, but

One last collection, German this time. Berthold Auerbach's Black Forest Village Stories, written between r843 and r853, were among the great bestsellers of the century, and figure 2r (overleaf) charts about one third of the Doljgeschichten collected in Cotta's r940 ten-volume edition. Here, too, three spaces interact and compete for attention. The first is composed by Nordstetten and the other Black Forest villages, and its features should by now be familiar: narrow geographic range, daily needs, basic services-all contained within the same circular pattern we have encountered in Britain. But if the spatial logic of the idyll is more or less the same everywhere (probably because of its extreme narrative simplicity), Auerbach's international space is already quite different from Mitford's or Galt's: instead of spo-. radic wonders, we find war memories (Germany as 'the battlefield of Europe', in Thomas Mann's words), threats of economic competition, and especially the basso continuo of emigration (America, first of all; then Switzerland, France, Greece, Russia, Spain ...). Except for Switzerland, which is very close, the narrative never actually moves into these foreign countries, but the voices of those who have left echo in almost every story, as if they were a large, hidden chorus. Nostalgic, usually; but in the more optimistic momentslike the letter from 'Nordstetten on the Ohio' ('we'll send for a parson from Germany. And my fields have just the same names

But in the meantime, just as earlier in Galt, a third, quasi-national space ('quasf, because German unity is still a generation away), is forcing its way into village life through 'central places' such as Horb, Freiburg, Rottenburg and Stuttgart. What we find there, though, is not manufacture, banks, and services, as in Britain, but law courts, jails, army barracks, and the like. The state. The state as repression: a grim determination to achieve the monopoly of legitimate violence that outlaws regional traditions, drafts people against their will, takes them to court, jails them if they run away ... 'You have ordered and commanded so much that there is nothing left to be ordered or commanded', complains the representative of Nordstetten to a county judge in the story 'Good government': 'and you will end up by putting a policeman under every tree to keep it from quarrelling with the wind and drinking too much when it rains'. 6 Here, even rivals in love-gamekeepers, soldiers, land surveyors-belong to repressive bodies. The formation of nation-states entailed a conflict between national and local loyalties, wrote Charles Tilly, and here it is: the local loyalty towards an older, smaller homeland stubbornly resisting its integration into the Germany to come. Heimat against Vaterland; the collective rituals so dear to Auerbach (and Mitford); our village; our society (the title of the first chapter of Cranford, Elizabeth Gaskell's village collection, whose last word is us).

diffusion of this pronoun in r9th-century culture, two forms-two rival forms of collective identity-immediately stand out from the rest: village stories, and national anthems.' That the local form leans towards the more proximate and 'inclusive' form (we as I+ you), and the national anthem towards the more martial, 'exclusive' one (we as I+ they versus you: war, enemy, glory ... ), is the apt final touch to their symbolic opposition. In their animosity towards national centralization, village stories diverge sharply from the provincial novels with which they are often confused, and are, if anything, much closer to regional novels-as is clear in Auerbach's explicit conjunction (Village stories of the Black Forest), or later in Hardy. 'The region is a place in itself', writes Ian Duncan, 'the source of its own terms of meaning and identity ... while the province is defined by its difference from [the capital].'8 Exactly: village and region are alternative homelands of sorts, whereas the provinces embody the capitulation of local reality to the national centre-Emma Bovary's idea that life is 'quelque chose de sublime' in Paris (or Madrid, or Moscow), and a desert everywhere
' Of twenty-eight European anthems I have been able to check, twenty-two establish a significant semantic: field around the first person plural, beginning of course with the very first word-Allons-of the greatest of them all. Nothing seems as essential to national anthems as this grammatical sign of collective identity; even the name of the country receives fewer mentions {zo), while the . semantic field of 'glory' has '9· 'past' and 'war' I5, 'enemy' and 'nature' '3· and 'God' a mere I2. Interestingly enough, the three European anthems older than the Marseillaise-the Dutch, English, and Danish anthems: 'William of Nassau', 'God Save the Queen', and 'King Christian'-all foreground the figme of the sovereign, and shoW no interest in the first person plural (except for 'God Save the Queen', which however places it in the object position: 'long to reign over u~', 'God save us all', 'may she defend our laws'). The difference between a dynastic and a collective basis for national identity is beautifully captured by this gram~ matical detail. s Ian Duncan, 'The Provincial or Regional Novel', in Patrick Brantlinger and William Thesing, eds, A Companion to the Victorian Novel, Oxford 2002.

else. 9 Like the provinciae of antiquity, subject to Rome but denied full citizenship, the provinces are 'negative' entities, defined by what is not there; _which also explains, by the way, why one cannot map provincial novels-you cannot map what is not there. It happens, there are un-mappable forms (Christmas stories are another one, for different reasons), and these setbacks, disappointing at first, are actually the sign of a method still in touch with reality: geography is a useful tool, yes, but does not explain everything. For that, we have astrology and 'Theory'.

VII
What do literary maps do ... First, they are a good way to prepare a text for analysis. You choose a unit-walks, lawsuits, luxury goods, whatever-find its occurrences, place them in space ... or in other words: you reduce the text to a few elements, and abstract them from the narrative flow, and construct a new, artificial object like the maps that I have been discussing. And with a little luck, these maps will be more than the sum oftheir parts: they will possess 'emerging' qualities, which were not visible at the lower level. Everybody, from the first readers onwards, had noticed the country walks of Our Village; but no one had ever reflected on the circular pattern they project on the English countryside, because no one-in the absence of a map . of the book-had ever managed to actually see it. Not that the map is itself an explanation, of course: but at least, it offers a model of the

If London does not enjoy the same mythical status as other European capitals, the reason is probably that the English provinces were more self:confident than their continental counterparts, especially after 'their' industrial revolution (Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield ... ). The hollow sense of unreality of Emma Bovary, or Ana de Ozores, or the three Prozorov sisters is thus hard to imagine in places like Milton or Middlemarch: full of problems, to be sure, but where life is absolutely real.

narrative universe which rearranges its components in a non-trivial way, and may bring some hidden patterns to the surface. And patterns are indeed what I have been discussing throughout this chapter. But are they also the proper object of geographical study? In an intelligent critique of the Atlas of the European Novel, the Italian geographer Claudio Cerreti has questioned this assumption, pointing out how patterns entail a Cartesian reduction of space to extension, where 'objects are analysed in terms of reciprocal positions and distances ... whether they are close or far from each other or from something else'. This however is not really geography, Cerreti goes on, but rather geometry; and the figures of the Atlas, for their part, are not really maps, but diagrams. The diagrams look like maps, yes, because they have been 'superimposed on a cartographic plane': but their true nature emerges unmistakably from the way I analyse them, which disregards the specificity of the various locations, to focus almost entirely on their mutual relations; which is indeed the way to read diagrams, but certainly not maps. w Let me give you an instance of what Cerreti means. Figure 22, reproduced from the Atlas, is a map of young protagonists of Parisian novels, and of their objects of desire; and I remember the little epiphany I had in front of this figure, when I realized that most young men live on one side of the Seine, and their lovers on the opposite side (or in the separate world of the Faubourg St-Germain). The epiphany, in other words, was Paris as diagram:" a matrix of relations, not a cluster of individual locations. I could see that the young men were in the Latin Quarter, of course, and the women in the crescent from the

Atlas I had studied some cartography, but had learned it only up to a point, and so I made mistakes. True. But if the Atlas is full of diagrams-and, in fact, so is this chapter. where I decided not even to 'superimpose' them onto geographic maps to make the point absolutely clear-if I keep making diagrams, then, it is because for me geometry 'signifies' more than geography." More, in the sense that a geometrical pattern is too orderly a shape to be the product of chance. It is a sign that something is at work here--that something has made the pattern the way it is.
But what?

VIII

'The form of any portion of matter, whether it be living or dead', writes D'Arcy Thompson in his strange wonderful book On Growth and Form, 'may in all cases alike be described as due to the action of force. In short, the form of an object is a "diagram of forces" .. .''3
" Geometry signifies more than geography: but it seldom signifies by itself. Here, the choice of village stories as the basis of this theoretical sketch may have been unfortunate, as the isotropic space which is so typical of this genre tends to overemphasize the role of geometry at the expense of geography: a fact I became aware of only after long, detailed exchanges with Claudio Cerreti and jacques Levy (who have all my gratitude, and shouldn't be held in the least responsible for the views I am expressing). In fact, the most common type of hterary map (in the Atlas of the European Novel, at any rate) looks less like those of Our Village than like that of Parisian novels, where the geometrical pattern is distorted by the specificity of PariS's social geography-as is particularly dear in the case ofthose three characters who start on the 'wrong' side of the Seine. (For two of them, Du Tillet and Popinot, the explanation is simple: they belong to the space of trade rather than to that of intellectual life in the Latin Quarter; for the third character, Wenceslas, I cannot find a satisfying reason.) '' D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, On Growth and Form [1942], Mineola, NY 1992, p. 16.

Diagram: Cartesian space. But diagram of forces. The distribution of events between the Black Forest villages and the administrative towns is the diagram of a conflict between local forces and national ones; Mitfoi:d's rings, the result of the village's gravitational pull over her perambulating narrator; Balzac's divided Paris, the battlefield between old wealth and ambitious petty bourgeois youth. Each pattern is a clue--a fingerprint of history, almost. 'The form of an object is a "diagram of forces", in this sense, at least, that from it we can ... deduce the forces that ... have acted upon it'. Deducing from the form of an object the forces that have been at work: this is the most elegant definition ever of what literary sociology should be. And for D'Arcy Thompson these forces are of two basic kinds: internal, and external. 'The structure in its final form is, as it were, the inner nucleus molded in various ways by the characteristics of the outer element', wrote Goethe in one of those morphological studies which D'Arcy Thompson knew very well: 'it is precisely thus that the animal retains its viability in the outer world: it is shaped from without as well as from within.''' Shaped from without, as well as from within ... But so is narrative. On this, the five volumes of Our Village offer a splendid test case. In the r824 volume, remember, the village was the undisputed centre of the surrounding countryside: the centripetal effects of the force 'from within' were omnipresent, while the force 'from without' was · nowhere to be seen: the narrator moved freely in every direction in her little idylliC world, and then turned back for the sheer pleasure of returning home, without ever being constrained by a contrary force (like, say, Jude Fawley at Christrninster, where he's brutally forced back into Wessex). 'Anything that embodies itself with some freedom seeks a rounded shape', reads another of Goethe's aphorisms, and

the rounded shape of figure 14 was indeed the embodiment of a literary form-a mentaUte, an ideology-for which village life was still fundamentally independent of external forces. This, in r824- Two collections later, in r828 (figure 23), the village's gravitational field is already weaker: the walks are less frequent, and their pattern has become wider, less regular; fewer stories take place in the village itself, while several are set outside of Berkshire, in undefined distant towns (and often in the past as well). Something is

wrong with the force from within, but as no counter-force challenges it yet, the basic pattern, although somewhat unsteady, remains in place. But by I832, it's all over (figure 24): the village's centripetal force is reduced to nothing, and the bulk of the book moves away, thirty miles, sixty, more, to play dumb parlour games in the mansions of the elite (and, again, ever more frequently in the past). 24: Mary Mitford, Our Village, volume v [18]2]

Something has happened, here, and two stories suggest what it is: rick-burning. 'Oh the horror of those fires-breaking forth night after night, sudden, yet expected .. .' reads the first narrative of the volume, 'The incendiary'; 'We lived in the midst of the disturbed districts,' adds 'Young master Ben', and 'no one who lived within reach of the armed peasantry ... could get rid of the vague idea of danger which might arrive at any moment .. .'. The armed peasantry of the I83o uprisings (figure 25): this is the 'force from without' which has 'acted upon' Our Village, altering its narrative pattern beyond recognition. Figure 26, which charts the three volumes one next to the other, summarizes the disintegration ofMitford's chronotope.

In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related fonns rather than in the precise definition ofeach; and the defonnation ofa complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself have to be left unanalysed and undefined .

Let me conclude by briefly returning to the beginning. Thomas Maule's r837 map of Berkshire, reproduced in figure 13, gave a good idea of the type of geography congenial to modern idyllic form: parks, rivers, country seats, low urbanization (and no railway in the

early twenties, when Mitford starts writing). Figure 27 is another of Moule's maps, Cheshire this time, and Knutsford, near the centre of the figure, is Gaskell's 'Cranford', the setting of her r853 rewriting of Our Village. In this case, Moule's map precedes the novel by fifteen years, but it already casts a shadow over Gaskell's projected idyll: urbanization is higher, Manchester is just 15 miles away, and by an uncanny coincidence Mitford's typical walk would end more or less at the Grand Junction Railway, where one of the book's most sympathetic characters, distracted by the latest number of Pickwick-the

regular novelty which has just arrived from London-is killed by a train. Social geography does not agree with the form of the idyll here, and in order to keep the genre alive Gaskell must literally hibernate her village: Cranford is presented as a place under siege, hardly alive, where no one dares to go anywhere, and everything is painstakingly saved (candles, carpets, clothes, stories ... ) to make it last as long as possible; and even so, only the half-magic arrival of Indian wealth can prolong its artificial existence. For every genre comes a moment when its inner form can no longer represent the most significant aspects of contemporary reality, I wrote in the previous chapter: at which point, either the genre loses its form under the impact of reality, thereby disintegrating, or it betrays reality in the name of form, becoming, in Shklovsky's words, a 'dull epigone'. Mitford in r8p, and Gaskell twenty years later, are the two ends of the spectrum: Our Village explodes, and Cranford is Madame Tussaud's idea of a village story.

Maps, is the title of this chapter. But there are maps and maps: Moule (figures 13 and 27), Barrell (15-16), Langton and Morris (25) have all made maps of real English spaces, reproducing actual features of their material environment; I have made maps/diagrams of fictional worlds, where the real and the imaginary coexist in varying, often elusive proportions. The figures are different. But when they are collated and juxtaposed, they allow us a glimpse of what D'Arcy Thompson had in mind in his great final chapter on 'The theory of transformations':
We rise from a conception of form to an understanding of the forces which gave rise to it ... and in the comparison of kindred forms ... we discern the magnitude and the direction of the forces which have suf-

ficed to convert the one form into the other. rs

In the comparison of the kindred forms of Our Village in r824, r828, and r832, and of the initial and final decades of Annals of the Parish, and of the British and German village stories, we discern indeed the various directions in which rural class struggle, the industrial takeoff, and the process of state formation have 'converted' the shape of nineteenth-century idylls. As in an experiment, the force 'from without' of large national processes alters the initial narrative structure beyond recognition, and reveals the direct, almost tangible relationship between social conflict and literary form. Reveals form as a diagram of forces; or perhaps, even, as nothing but force.

Figure 28 (overleaf) reproduces the only tree-'an odd looking affair, but indispensable', as Darwin writes to his publisher in the spring of r859'-in The Origin of Species; it appears in the fourth chapter, 'Natural selection' (which in later editions becomes 'Natural selection; or, the survival of the fittest'), in the section on 'Divergence of character'. But when the image is first introduced, Darwin does not call it a 'tree' :2

Diagram, again. After the quantitative diagrams of the first chapter, and the spatial ones of the second, evolutionary trees constitute morphological diagrams, where history is systematically correlated with form. And indeed, in contrast to literary studies-where theories of form are usually blind to history, and historical work blind to form-for evolutionary thought morphology and history are truly the two dimensions of the same tree: where the vertical axis charts, from the bottom up, the regular passage of time (every interval, writes Darwin, 'one thousand generations'), while the horizontal one follows the formal diversification ('the little fans of diverging dotted lines') that will eventually lead to 'well-marked varieties', or to entirely new species. The horizontal axis follows formal diversification ... But Darwin's words are stronger: he speaks of 'this rather perplexing subject'elsewhere, 'perplexing & unintelligible'·-whereby forms don't just 'change', but change by always diverging from each other (remember, we are in the section on 'Divergence of Character').'

'principle', 6 the reality of divergence pervades the history of life, defining its morphospace-its space-of-forms: an important concept, in the pages that follow-as an intrinsically expanding one. From a single common origin, to an immense variety of solutions: it is this incessant growing-apart oflife forms that the branches of a morphological tree capture with such intuitive force. 'A tree can be viewed as a simplified description of a matrix ofdistances', write CavalliSforza, Menozzi and Piazza in the methodological prelude to their History and Geography ofHuman Genes; and figure 29, with its mirrorlike alignment of genetic groups and linguistic families drifting away from each other (in a 'correspondence [that] is remarkably high but not perfect', as they note with aristocratic aplomb),' makes clear what they mean: a tree is a way of sketching how far a certain language has moved from another one, or from their common point of origin. And iflanguage evolves by diverging, why not literature too?

'One might say ... that "divergence of character'' requires no separate principle beyond adaptation, natural selection, and historical contingency ... Climates alter; topography changes; populations become isolated, and some, adapting to modified environments, form new species. What more do we need? ...

Why is there a close similarity between linguistic and genetic trees? ... The correlation is certainly not due to the effect of genes on languages; if anything, it is likely that there is a reverse influence, in that linguistic barriers may strengthen the genetic isolation between groups speaking different languages . .. The explanation of the parallelism between genetic and linguistic trees is to be sought in the com· mon effect of ... events determining the separation of two groups. After fission and migration of one ~r bo~ moieties to a different area, they are partially or completely isolated from each other.

each other, selection intervenes, allowing only a few to survive. In a seminar of a few years ago, I addressed the analogous problem of literary survival, using as a test case the early stages of British detective fiction. We chose clues as the trait whose transformations were likely to be most revealing for the history of the genre, and proceeded to chart the relationships between Arther Conan Doyle and some of his contemporaries as a series ofbranchings, which added up to the (modest) tree of figure 30. 8 Here, from the very first branching at the bottom of the tree (whether clues were present or not) two things were immediately clear: the 'formar fact that several of Doyle's rivals (those on the left) did not use clues-and the 'historicar fact that they were all forgotten. It is a good illustration of what the literary market is like: ruthless competition-hinging on form. Readers discover that they like a certain device, and if a story doesn't seem to include it, they simply don't read it (and the story becomes extinct). This pressure of cultural selection probably explains the second branching of the tree, where clues are present, but serve no real function: as in 'Race with the Sun', for instance, where a clue reveals to the hero that the drug is in the third cup of coffee, and then, when he is offered the third cup, he actually drinks it. Which is indeed 'perplexing & unintelligible', and the only possible explanation is that these writers realized that clues were popular, and tried to smuggle them into their stories-but hadn't really understood how clues worked, and so didn't use them very well.

I am here summarizing and updating the results of a larger study, 'The Slaughterhouse of Literature', Modern Language Quarterly, March 2ooo. It should however be kept in mind that a process of selection determined by a single character, like the one presented here, is almost certainly atypical: it is (hopefully) valid for detective fiction, given the centrality of clues within its narrative structure-but it is precisely this 'condensation' of the structure in a single element that is highly unusual. As a rule, literary trees will have to be based on a multiplicity of morphological traits.

Presence of clues

From the standpoint of technique, the devices employed by Conan Doyle in his stories are simpler than the devices we find in other English mystery novels. On the other hand, they show greater concentration ... The most important clues take the form of secondary facts, which are presented in such a way that the reader does not notice them ... they are intentionally placed in the oblique form of a subordinate clause , .. on which the storyteller does not dwell.

Third branching: clues are present, they have a function, but are not visible: the detective mentions them in his final explanation, but we have never 'seen' them in the course of the story. Here we lose the last of Doyle's rivals (which is exactly what, sooner or later, we had expected to see), but we also lose half of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which we hadn't expected at all; and the next branchingclues must be not just visible, but decodable by the reader: soon to become a key 'technical law' of the genre-is even more surprising, since decodable clues appear, even being generous, in only four of the twelve Adventures and, being strict, in none of them. Why this last-minute stumble on Doyle's part? I try to explain it in 'The Slaughterhouse of Literature', and wlll not repeat the argument here. But I will mention an objection raised in the course of the seminar to the logic behind figure 30. This tree, said one of the participants, assumes that morphology is the key factor of literary history: that Doyle owes his phenomenal success to his greater skill in the handling of clues; to his being the only one who made it to the top of the tree, as it were. But why should form be the decisive reason for survival? Why not social privilege instead-the fact that Doyle was writing for a well-established magazine, and his rivals were not? Plausible. So I went to the library, where I discovered that, in the course of the 189os, over one hundred detective stories by twentyfive different authors had been published in the Strand Magazine alongside Sherlock Holmes. Since so many writers had access to the same venue as Doyle, the 'social privilege' objection lost its force; but, more importantly, the study of those hundred-odd stories-while confirming the uniqueness of Doyle's technical feat-also added two entirely new branches to the initial tree of detective fiction (figure 31). The more one looked in the archive, in other words, the more complex and 'darwinian' became the genre's morphospace. The family of narrative forms evoked in the first of these chapters was beginning to take shape.

In ~is diagram, where the thickness of the line indicates the number of stories published ~unng each year, the two new branches are the second and third from the left. The former ~ndudes those stories in which dues are not present, but are verbally evoked, or perhaps mvoked by the characters ('If only we had a clue!'; 'Did you find any dues?'), in what is probably another awkward attempt to smuggle them into a text that does not really need them.

Is divergence a factor, in literary history? These first finding~ suggest a cautious Yes. But what is it, that generates this morphologiCal dnft· ing-away? Texts? I doubt it. Texts are distributed on the branches of the tree, yes, but the 'nodes' of the branching process ~~e ~?t defined by texts here, but by clues (their absence, presence, VIs1b1hty etc): by something that is much smaller than any individual text-a sentence, a metaphor ('It was the band! The speckled band!'), at times ('!could only catch some allusion to a rat') not even ~ full word. And on the other hand, this system of differences at the m1croscop!clevel adds .up to something that is much larger than any individual text, and wh1ch in our case is of course the genre--or the tree-of detective fiction. The very small, and the very large; these are the forces that shape literary history. Devices and genres; not texts. Texts are certamly the real objects ofliterature (in the Strand Magazine you don't find 'clues' or 'detective fiction', you find Sherlock Holmes, or Hilda Wade, or The Adventures of a Man of Science); but they are not the right ob~ects of knowledge for literary history. Take the concept ofgenre: usual~y, hterary criticism approaches it in terms of what Ernst Mayr calls typolog1· cal thinking':9 we choose a 'representative individual', and through it define the genre as a whole. Sherlock Holmes, say, and detecttve fi~· tion; Wilhelm Meister and the Bildungsroman; you analyse Goethe s novel and it counts as an analysis of the entire genre, because for . typol~gical thinking there is really no gap between the real object and the object of knowledge. But once a genre is visualized as a tree, the continuity between the two inevitably disappears: the genre becomes an abstract 'diversity spectrum' (Mayr again), whose internal multl· plicity no individual text will ever be able to represent. And so, even 'A Scandal in Bohemia' becomes just one leafamong many: dehghtful, of course-but no longer entitled to stand for the genre as a whole.
9

A diversity spectrum. Quite wide, in figures 30 and 31, because when a new genre first arises, and no 'central' convention has yet crystallized, its space-of-forms is usually open to the most varied experiments. And then, there is the pressure ofthe market. The twenty-five authors ofthe Strand Magazine are all competing for the same, limited market niche, and their meanderings through morphospace have probably a lot to do with a keen desire to outdo each other's inventions: after all, when mystery writers come up with an 'aeronaut' who kills a hiker with the anchor of his balloon, or a somnambulist painter who draws the face of the man he has murdered, or a chair that catapults its occupants into a neighboring park, they are clearly looking for the Great Idea that will seal their success. And yet, just as clearly, aeronauts and cata· pults are totally random attempts at innovation, in the sense in which evolutionary theory uses the term: they show no foreknowledge-no idea, really-of what may be good for literary survival. In making writers branch out in every direction, then, the market also pushes them into all sorts of crazy blind alleys; and divergence becomes indeed, as Darwin had seen, inseparable from extinction. There are many ways of being alive, writes Richard Dawkins, but many more ways ofbeing dead-and figures 30 and 31, with all those. texts that were so quickly forgotten, fully bear out his point: literary pathology, one may almost call it. But instead of reiterating the verdict of the market, abandoning extinct literature to the oblivion decreed by . its initial readers, these trees take the lost 99 per cent of the archive and reintegrate it into the fabric of literary history, allowing us to finally 'see' it. It is the same issue raised in the first chapter-the one per cent ofthe canon, and the ninety-nine offorgotten literature--but viewed from a different angle: whereas graphs abolish all qualitative difference among their data, trees tryto articulate that difference. In the graph of British novels between r7ro and r8so, for instance (figure 14), Pride and Prejudice and The Lifo of Pill Garlick; Rather a Whimsical Sort of Fellow, appear as exactly alike: two dots in the r8r3 column, impossible to tell apart. But figures 30 and 3I aim precisely at distinguishing 'The Red-Headed League' from 'The Assyrian

Trees; or, divergence in literary history. But this view of culture usually encounters a very explicit objection. 'Among the many differences in deep principle between natural evolution and cultural change', writes Stephen Jay Gould, their 'topology'-that is to say, the abstract overall shape of the two processes-is easily the most significant:
Darwinian evolution at the species level and above is a story of continuous and irreversible proliferation ... a process of constant separation and distinction. Cultural change, on the other hand, receives a powerful boost from amalgamation and anastomosis of different traditions. A clever traveller may take one look at a foreign wheel, import the invention back home, and change his local culture fundamentally and forever. ro

THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL-THAT IS, OF HUMAN CULTURE

The traveller and his wheel are not a great example (they are a case of simple diffusion, not of amalgamation), but the general point is clear, and is frequently made by historians of technology. George Basalla:
Different biological species usually do not interbreed, and on the rare occasions when they do their offspring are infertile. Artifactual types, on the other hand, are routinely combined to produce new and fruitful entities ... The internal combustion engine branch was joined with that of the bicycle and horse-drawn carriage to create the automobile branch, which in turn merged with the dray wagon to produce the motor truck. u

irreconcilable 'differences in deep principle' between convergence and divergence, passages like these (which could be easily multiplied) suggest a sort ofdivision oflabour between them; or perhaps, better, a cycle to which they both contribute in turn. Convergence, I mean, only anses on the basis ofprevious divergence, and its power tends in fact to be directly proportional to the distance between the original branches (bicycles, and internal combustion engines). Conversely, a successful convergence usually produces a poweifol new burst ofdivergence: like the 'new evolutionary series [which] began almost immediately after Whitney's [cotton gin] was put to work', and which quicldy became, concludes Basalla, 'the point of origin for an entirely new set of artifacts'." Divergence prepares the ground for convergence, which unleashes further divergence: this seems to be the typical pattern. '3 Moreover, the force of the two mechanisms varies widely from field to field, ranging from the pole of technology, where convergence is particularly strong, to the opposite extreme of language, where divergence-remember the 'matrix of distances' of figure 29-is clearly the dominant factor; whilethespecificpositionofliterature-thistechnology-of-languagewithin the whole spectrum remains to be determined. ' 4 And don't be
" Basalla, The Evolution of Technology, pp. 30, 34'3 It is easy (in theory, at least) to envision how this cyclical matrix could be applied to the history of genres: convergence among separate lineages would be decisive in the genesis of genres of particular significance; then, once a genre's form stabilizes, 'interbreeding' would stop, and divergence would become the dominant force. 14 In Thomas Pavel's recent La pensie du roman, Paris 2003, which is the most ambitious theory of the novel since the masterpieces of the inter~war years, divergence is the fundam~ntal force during the first seventeen centuries of ~e novel's existence, and convergence in the last three (these are my extrapolatiOns, not Pavel's). The interpretation of these results is however far from obvious. Should one insist on the striking quantitative supremacy of divergence even in the notoriously 'synchretic' genre of the novel? Or should one focus on the (ap~ar.ent) historical trend, viewing divergence as a 'primitive' morphological pnnc1ple, and convergence as a more 'mature' one? And are Balzac, say, or Joyce, only instances of convergence (pp. 245, 373)-or are they also the initiators of strikingly new formal branches? All questions for another occasion.

misled by the 'topological' technicalities of all this: the real content of the controversy, not technical at all, is our very idea of culture. Because if the basic mechanism of change is that of divergence, then cultural history is bound to be random, full of false starts, and profoundly path-dependent: a direction, once taken, can seldom be reversed, and culture hardens into a true 'second nature'-hardly a benign metaphor. If, on the other hand, the basic mechanism is that of convergence, change will be frequent, fast, deliberate, reversible: culture becomes more plastic, more human, if you wish. But as human history is so seldom human, this is perhaps not the strongest of arguments.

IV

One last tree: this time, not the 'many more ways of being dead' of Doyle's rivals, but the still numerous 'ways of being alive' discovered between r8oo and 2ooo by that great narrative device known as 'free indirect style'. The technique was first noticed in an article on French grammar published in r887 in the Zeitschrift for romanische Philologie, which described it, in passing, as 'a peculiar mix of indirect and direct discourse, which draws the verbal tenses and pronouns from the former, and the tone and the order of the sentence from the latter' .'5 Here is an example from Mansfield Park:
It was the abode of noise, disorder, and impropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought to be. She could not respect her parents, as she had hoped. '6

Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought to be: the tone is clearly Fanny's, and expresses her profound emotional frustration at her parents' house. Nobody was in their right place ...

She could not respect her parents: the (past) verbal tenses and (third person) pronouns evoke for their part the typical distance of narrative discourse. Emotions, plus distance: it is truly a peculiar mix, free indirect style, but its composite nature was precisely what made it 'click' with that other strange compromise formation which is the process of modern socialization: by leaving the individual voice a certain amount of freedom, while permeating it with the impersonal stance of the narrator, free indirect style enacted that veritable transposition de l'objectifdans le subjectif'7 which is indeed the substance of the socialization process. And the result was the genesis of an unprecedented 'third' voice, intermediate and almost neutral in tone between character and narrator: the composed, slightly resigned voice of the well-socialized individual, of which Austen's heroines-these young women who speak of themselves in the third person, as if from the . exampIes. ,s outside-are sueh stunmng
Placed as it is halfWay between social doxaand the individual voice, free indirect style is a good indicator of their changing balance of forces, of which the tree in figure 33 (overleaf) offers a schematic visualization. And as can be seen, not much happens as long as free indirect style remains confined to western Europe; at most, we have the gradual, entropic drift from 'reflective' to 'non-reflective' consciousness:'' that is to say, from sharp punctual utterances like those in Manifteld Park, to Flaubert's all-encompassing moods, where the character's inner space is unknowingly colonized by the commonplaces of
" Charles Bally, 'Le style indirecte libre en frans:ais moderne', GermanischRomanische Monatschrift, r9r2, second part, p. 6o} t8 I have analysed in detail the connexion between free indirect style and socialization in 'Ilsecolo serio', Il romanzo, vol. I, Torino 2oor (forthcoming, Princeton 2005). Needless to say, I do not claim that free indirect style is only used to represent the process of socialization (which would be absurd).' but ra~er that between the two existed--especially early on-a profound elective affimty. 19 For these terms, see Ann Banfield's classic study of free indirect style, Unspeakable Sentences, Boston r982.

public opinion. But just as the individual mind seems about to be submerged by ideology, a geographical shift to the east reverses the trend, associating free indirect style with conflict rather than with consensus. Raskolnikov's inner speech, writes Bakhtin
is filled with other people's words that he has recently heard or read [and is] constructed like a succession of living and impassioned replies to all those words ... He does not think about phenomena, he speaks with them ... he addresses himself (often in the second person singular, as if to another person), he tries to persuade himself, he taunts, exposes, ridicules himself. 20

A language filled with 'other people's words', just like Emma Bovary's: but where those words, instead of being passively echoed, arouse 'living and impassioned replies'. Or to quote the passage chosen by Bakhtin himself to illustrate his point (it's the moment when Raskolnikov reacts to the news of his sister's impending marriage):
'Won't take place? And what are you going to do to stop it? Forbid it? By what right? What can you promise them instead, in order to possess such a right? To devote your whole life, your whole future to them, when you finish your course and get a job? We've heard that one before, that's just maybe-what about now? I mean, you've got to do something right now, do you realize that?' ... It was a long time since {these questions] had begun to lacerate his heart, and it was positively an age since his present sense of anguish and depression had come into being ... It was clear that now was not the time to feel miserable, to suffer passively with the thought that the questions were not capable of resolution; no, instead he must do something, and at once, as quickly as possible. Whatever happened, he must take some action, or else ... 21

33: Free indirect style in modem narrative, 18oo-2ooo Great page. But can we really speak of free indirect style for those sentences in 'the second person singular, as if to another person' that open th\' passage, and that are so crucial for Bakhtin's argument (and for his entire theory of the novel)? No, not quite: the second person (especially if in quotes) indicates the direct discourse of an open-ended discussion, rather than (as in the second half of the passage) the narrative report of thoughts and emotions which is the typical modality of free indirect style. Why this double register, then, in the representation of Raskolnikov's inner debate? Probably, what happened was something like this: once free indirect style 'migrated' into the world of Crime and Punishment, it began drifting towards the stylistic centre of gravity of the novel--dialogism-and became as a result much more intense and dramatic than ever before ('it was clear that now was not the time to feel miserable .. .'). It became, one could say, almost dialogic. Almost. But in the end, free indirect style was a narrative technique, whose retrospective inflection ruled out the open-endedness of dialogism. And so, after having shuttled back and forth between the two techniques, Dostoevsky toned down free indirect style, so that dialogism could come into its own. A branch of the tree of life may approach another branch, wrote A. L. Kroeber in the passage quoted a few pages back, but it will not normally coalesce with it. True. And at times, the same is true of the tree of culture: even an extraordinarily flexible technique like free indirect style (and in the hands of a writer of genius) could never 'coalesce' with the branch of dialogism, no matter how close the two styles had come to each other. Culture is not the realm of ubiquitous 'hybridity': it, too, has its barriers, its impassable limits. In a moment, we will encounter another exa_mple.

the tree, which occurs around r88o, at the height of the naturalist movement. Here, the fault line-which is, again, geographic and morphological at once-runs between different forms of symbolic hegemony in fin-de-siecle Europe: in the West, the silent, interiorized doxa oflarge nation-states, arising almost impersonally from newspapers, books, and an anonymous public opinion; in the South, the noisy, multi-personal 'chorus' (Leo Spitzer) of the small village of I Malavoglia, or the sharp whispers of the provincial confessionals of La Regenta; later, the longue duree of collective oral myths in Batouala or Men of Maize."' Here, free indirect style embodies a form of social cohesion which-in its reliance on explicit, spoken utterances, rather than 'non-reflective' absorption-is more quarrelsome and intrusive than in western Europe, but also much more unstable: the spokesmen for the social (villagers, confessor, chief) must be always physically there, ready to reiterate over and over again the dominant values, or else things fall apart. As indeed they do, in all of these novels. Another collective voice, of a different nature, echoes in the same years in Zola's Germinal: the voice of the working class. The main speaker, at the great nocturnal gathering during the miners' strike:
Two examples. 'Nowadays mischief-makers got up to all kinds of tricks; and at Trezza you saw faces which had never been seen there before, on the cliffs, people claiming to be going fishing, and they even stole the sheets put out to dry, if there happened to be any. Poor Nunziata had had a new sheet stolen that way. - Poor girl! Imagine robbing her, a girl who had worked her fingers to the bone to provide bread for all those little brothers her father had left on her hands when he had upped and gone to seek his fortune in Alexandria of Egypt.' Giovanni Verga, I Malavoglia, ch. 2. 'He's a good old man, the sun, and so equitable! He shines for all living people, from the greatest to the most humble. He knows neither rich nor poor, neither black nor white. Whatever may be their colour, whatever may be their fortune, all men are his sons. He loves them all equally; favours their plantations; dispels, to please them, the cold and sullen fog; reabsorbs the rain; and drives out the shadow. Ah! The shadow. Unpityingly, relentlessly, the sun pursues it wherever it may be. He hates nothing else.' Rene Maran, Batouala, ch. 8.
22

~hese poor de~ls, they ~ere just machine-fodder, they were penned hke cattle, the big co~pames were devouring them bit by bit, legalizing slavery · · · But the mmer was no longer the ignorant brute buried in the ~owels of the earth ... From the depths of the pit an army was springmg up · · . Yes!, labour would call capital to account, this impersonal god, unknown to the worker, crouching somewhere in the mystery of its tab~rnacle, whence he sucked the blood of the poor starving creatures he hved on! 2 3

Here, we find all of the elements we have encountered so far. There IS the emotional spark (ces miserables ... ) that brings free indirect style mto bemg. There is the overlap of character and narrator (with the metaphor of the avengmg army that will return, unforgettably, m the last sentence of the novel), and the telescoping of individual and sooal class, Wlth the 'we' of direct discourse that turns into the thud person p~ural. And then, there is the metamorphosis of popular language mto French'. Eugen Weber:
French, which prizes abstract terms over concrete ones ... refines language by elimin~ting the de~ails that count so much in popular speech and ~he great vanety of specific and descriptive terms that flourished in pat~1s. It prefers to interpret rather than describe reality, to express ideas, not JUSt to relate facts. 24

Peasants into Frenchmen, is the title of Weber's book; miners into Frenchmen, one could repeat for the free indirect style of Germinal, that seems to find a VOICe for the 'nationalization of the masses' of the late 19th century. Not for nothing, its ideal vehicle is Etienne Lantier, who IS at once one of the miners, and their 'representative': the man who has risen from the ranks because he 'speaks well' (and hopes to use h1s grft to make a career-in Paris, possibly). Class antagonism although powerfully expressed, bleeds oddly into individual ambition:

placing free indirect style once again in a position-if not exactly ambiguous-of implicit, and almost invisible, social mediation.

VI

So far, the social and 'objective' sides of free indirect style have dominated the scene: the 'truths' of the neo-classical narrator, the doxa of public opinion, the force of abstract ideas, the voice of small communities, of social classes, of collective oral myths ... But around 1900 a different group of writers begins to experiment at the opposite end of the spectrum, that of the irreducibly singular. First comes a cluster of upper-class stylizations (James, Mann, Proust, Woolf ... ), where the deviation from social norms is often so slight that it may not even form a separate branch; then, more decisive, Joyce's generation unceremoniously drops all stylistic good manners, and pushes its field of observation well inside the secret, unconscious layers of psychic life. The 'objective' side of free indirect style does not quite disappear, if only because of the countless commonplaces that Ulysses inherits from Bouvard and Pecuchet: but joyce reverses their function, and subordinates them to the centrifugal, idiosyncratic drift of Bloom's associations. It's the same double register, and the same final outcome, as that of Crime and Punishment: just as, there, the third person of free indirect style had approached the second person of dialogism, but had been finally ousted by it-so, in Ulysses, the third person is constantly drifting towards, but also yielding to the first person of joyce's chosen technique, the stream of consciousness. ' 5 Here, too, cultural 'interbreeding' encountered a barrier that could not be passed.
'' 'He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him. For hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after.' James Joyce, Ulysses, ch. 6.

In the final branching of the tree-Latin American 'dictator novels'the fluctuation between third and first person is still there, but its direction has been reversed: in place of a third-person narrative modulating into a first-person monologue, we see the dictator's attempt to objectify his private (and pathological) self into the monumental poses of a public persona. 'My dynasty begins and ends in me, in IHE,' writes Augusto Roa Bastes in I the Supreme; and towards the end of the book:
HE, erect, with his usual brio, the sovereign power of his first day. One hand behind him, the other tucked in the lapel of his frock coat ... I is HE, definitively, I~HE·SUPREME. Immemorial. Imperishable.~ 6

In Roa Bastes's novel, as in Carpentier's Reasons of State and Garcia Marquez's General in his Labyrinth-the other two dictator novels of 1974, a year after the putsch against Allende in Chile-the 'I' of El Supremo still largely overshadows his 'HE', thus confining free indirect style to quite a limited role. But with Mario Vargas Uosa the technique moves into the foreground, and realizes its full political potential: by presenting the mind offue;'dictator 'unmediated by any judging point of view'-to repeat Ann ~nfield's limpid definition of free indirect style'7- Vargas Llosa endov;,s the putrid substratum of political terror with an unforgettably sinister matter-of-factness:
Had the United States had a more sincere friend than him, in the past thirty-one years? What government had given them greater support in the UN? Which was the first to declare war on Germany and Japan? Who gave the biggest bribes to representatives, senators, governors, mayors, lawyers and reporters in the United States? His reward: economic sanctions by the OAS to make that nigger R6mulo Betancourt happy, to keep sucking at the tit of the Venezuelan oil.

From the abode of noise and impropriety, where nobody was in their right place, to the asshole gringos handing him bullshit about sovereignty, democracy, and human rights. This is what comparative literature could be, if it took itself seriously as world literature, on the one hand, and as comparative morphology, on the other. Take a form, follow it from space to space, and study the reasons for its transformations: the 'opportunistic, hence unpredictable' reasons of evolution, in Ernst Mayr's words.'9 And of course the multiplicity of spaces is the great challenge, and the curse, almost, of comparative literature: but it is also its peculiar strength, because it is only in such a wide, non-homogeneous geography that some fundamental principles of cultural history become manifest. As, here, the dependence of morphological novelty on spatial discontinuity: 'allopatric speciation', to quote Ernst Mayr one more time: a new species (or at any rate a new formal arrangement), arising when a population migrates into a new homeland, and must quickly change in order to survive. Just like free indirect style when it moves into Petersburg, Aci Trezza, Dublin, Ciudad Trujillo ... Spatial discontinuity boosting morphological divergence. It's a situation that reminds me ofGide's reflections on the form of the novel at the time he was writing The Counterftiters: granted that the novel is a slice oflife, he muses, why should we always slice 'in the direction of length', emphasizing the passage of time? why not slice in the direction ofwidth, and of the multiplicity of simultaneous events? Length,

plus width: this is how a tree signifies. And you look at figure 33, or at the others before it, and cannot help but wonder: which is the most significant <)Xis, here-the vertical, or the horizontal? Diachronic succession, or synchronic drifting apart? This perceptual uncertainty between time and (morpho-)space-this impossibility, in fact, of really 'seeing' them both at once-is the sign of a new conception of literary history, in which literature moves forwards and sideways at once; often, more sideways than forwards. Like Shklovsky's great metaphor for art, the knight's move at chess.

Three chapters; three models; three distinct 'sections' of the literary field. First, the system of novelistic genres as a whole; then, 'the road from birth to death' of a specific chronotope; and now, the microlevel of stylistic mutations. But despite the differences of scale, some aspects of the argument remain constant. First of all, a somewhat pragmatic view of theoretical knowledge. 'Theories are nets', wrote Navalis, 'and only he who casts will catch'. Yes, theories are nets, and we should evaluate them, not as ends in themselves, but for how they concretely change the way we work: for how they allow us to enlarge the literary field, and re-design it in a better way, replac-. ing the old, useless distinctions (high and low; canon and archive; this or that national literature ... ) with new temporal, spatial, and morphological distinctions. In the second place, the models I have presented also share a clear preference for explanation over interpretation; or perhaps, better, for the explanation of general structures over the interpretation of individual texts. This is of course a major issue in its own right; but for now, let me at least say that the point, here, was not a new reading of Waverley, or Black Forest Village Stories, or I Malavoglia, but the definition of those larger patterns that are their necessary preconditions:

r
92 GRAPHS, MAPS, TREES

the temporal cycles that determine the rise and fall ofliterary genres; the circular patterns of old village cultnre; the cluster of possibilities (and constraints) within which free indirect style accomplished its various symbolic tasks. Were I to name a common denominator for all these attempts, I would probably choose: a materialist conception ofform. An echo of the Marxist problematic of the r96os and 7os? Yes and no. Yes, because the great idea of that critical season-form as the most profoundly social aspect of literature: form as force, as I put it in the close to my previous chapter-remains for me as valid as ever. And no, because I no longer believe that a single explanatory framework may account for the many levels of literary production and their multiple links with the larger social system: whence a certain conceptual eclecticism of these pages, and the tentative nature of many of the examples. Much remains to be done, of course, on the compatibility of the various models, and the explanatory hierarchy to be established among them. But right now, opening new conceptual possibilities seemed more important than justifYing them in every detail.

Evolution at Close Range

I.

I read the last chapter of this book first, because its title and author aroused my interest. That title 'Trees', and the second figure (no. 29) that appears in it concern me professionally, as I have devoted many years of my life to the analysis of evolutionary trees drawn from the biological data of human populations. The construction of that figure is based on such analyses. I have been able to devote less time to Franco Moretti's other writings; but The Way of the World and Atlas of the European Novel had earlier struck me by their ambition to tell the 'stories' of literary structures, or the evolution over time and space of cultural traits considered not in their singularity, but their complexity. An evolution, in other words, 'viewed from afar', analogous at least in certain respects to that which I have taught and practised in · my study of genetics. Curiosity then prompted me to read the other two. chapters of this triptych, and to offer some general reflections to its readers. What follows is an attempt to lay these out as a contribution to an interdisciplinary discussion, in the conviction that literary writing can be construed as a system that is not bound by the particular instruments it has itself created, and is therefore capable of metabolizing metaphors and ambiguities belonging to several systems of knowledge. I will add that the system of scientific knowledge, especially that of modem molecular biology, is paradoxically very well suited to

96

such a metabolizing function: let me just point out how, in technical language, we commonly speak of the 'translation' and 'transcription' of DNA.

Biological evolution in a literary metaphor
z. Biological evolution is based on the chemical structure of DNA, which is the biological memory of all beings, human or otherwise. Let us recall Genesis, Chapter 2: 3r8. And the Lord said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him an help meet for him. '9· And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
20.

one of the most effective among the many in which nature abounds. The literary metaphor of the rib (consciously or not) offers an elegant introduction to the concept of the transmission of information: we know today that DNA sequences are chains of chemical molecules, whose fimction is to contain the information that regulates the life of each of our cells, and to transmit it from one generation to the next, with changes that may be minimal but are very important for evolution. For information to be transmitted accurately, without errors, a code is required. Linguistic codes and DNA codes, names and genes, present certain analogies in their rules of transmission: mutation, selection, drift are common to them. Both codes are ambiguous, redundant and degenerative. The presence of many names, of a lot of information, makes discrimination essential. What is needed, in other words, is a mechanism that ensures a sufficient but not unlimited variability of significations: thus in the human genome there are some 30-so,ooo genes (that is, units of information), about the same number as there are words in Italian. Information that is codified becomes organized in a structure. The structure evolves over time: the text therefore requires a context. Writing recalls the text from the context, constituting its memory. In the case of DNA, we know the alphabet, and we also know the text (the sequence of the human genome discovered in the last few years), but its meaning remains largely unknown, and constitutes the challenge of the years to come (the 'post-genome'-in a literary metaphor, 'post-modern'years). Its writing is thus for the moment unreproducible, but it is endowed with a very long and precise memory (the so-called 'molecular clock').

And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;

21.

And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

We may deduce that the earliest way of possessing an object was to give it a name bearing as much information as possible: without information there is no possession of life. Yet for the object to enter, relate to and cooperate with us, in other words to be 'convivial', it is not enough to give it a name. There must be a mechanism of 'transcription' (the rib) that transmits the information from one organism to another, perhaps with some slight modification. The mechanism of sexual recombination (the exchange of chromosomes between man and woman) is

In the case of the literary text, its function changes over time, often constituting a memory of the context more than of itself. In his book In the Vineyard of the Text. Hugh:s Didascalicon, Ivan Illich comments on the Didascalicon of the theologian and mystic Ugo di San Vittore, written around rr28. Ugo di San Vittore testified to a transformation of the ancient art of mem· orizing a monastic manuscript that was intended to be read aloud, to the new art of a book designed to serve history. To read is tantamount to recreating the historical tissue in the heart of the reader. A text, then, that is memory of the past and presage of future transformations of its context. 5· In the biological world of DNA, reading and writing belong to two different but complementary systems. The fact that DNA has the shape of a double and not a single helix obeys the rule that the reading of DNA must be faithfully transcribed, without errors. Much of the energy of our cells is devoted to correcting possible errors of transcription: only a minimal number of these are 'fortunate' errors, in the sense that they can be favourable rather than harmful to our organism, and hence in a broad sense to our species. Still, the presence of the context has induced in us humans-being typically cultural animals-an evolution of the nervous systems that we are currently discovering with astonishment and wonder. The technique of functional magnetic resonance allows us to visualize the activation of the circuits in the brain that preside over the most variegated cognitive paths. Here I would like to mention just one, fascinating field of research into our system of reading. If an individual is asked to read a word, and then the same individual is read the word at a moment when he or she no longer remembers it, a comparison of the two images captured by magnetic resonance reveals that quite distinct areas of the brain are activated. Without entering into the particulars of the functional anatomy implied in the reading and hearing of the same words, let us just emphasise

once more the importance of the context: an identical mean· ing is perceived by two distinct cognitive systems according to the way in which it is transmitted. Ambiguity, allusion, redun· dance, often vilified as means of cultural impoverishment, are vindicated as forms that not only belong to the literary field, but intervene in that subtle play which begins with the pre· lexical and pre-semantic representation of a text perceived as a picture, and ends in the context-dependent working-out of their meaning. 6. The role of variability in the memory of the past and the construction of the present is fundamental for the evolution of our species: the search for the ways in which this variability is generated in nature was for a long time the major stumbling-block for Darwin, who by a strange quirk of fate never learnt of the revolutionary work of Mendel. In his Way of the World, Franco Moretti proposes the very interesting idea that even literary genres cannot survive without cultural variety. The genre of the Bildungsroman, he shows, was born in Europe after the French Revolution in response to a precise social need: mediation of the conflicting demands of freedom and stability. The narration of youth allows this dilemma to be symbolically transcended: if as a mature man · I narrate my youth, I depict the indeterminacy of my past in the deterininate, stable voice of the adult I have become. In the mediation of a tension with a distension, however, the narrative register creates an equilibrium that is the prelude to a loss ofthe original creative tension, and thus to the progressive extinction of the genre. But in the very different, and ethnically more heterogeneous setting of the United States, a Bildungsroman was reborn in which youth itself narrated its own moral education, in Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Moretti suggests that the cultural

variability of the American context allowed the transplant of a literary form that had exhausted its social function in Europe.

Biological evolution (very briefly)
7· Recognizing the role biological variability plays in the reconstruction of the memory of our (biological) past requires ways to visualize and elaborate data at our disposal on a geographical basis. To this end, let us consider a gene (a segment of DNA possessed of a specific, ascertainable biological function); and for each gene let us analyse its identifiable variants, or alleles. The percentage of individuals who carry a given allele may vary (very widely) from one geographical locality to another. If we can verifY the presence or absence of that allele in a sufficient number of individuals living in a circumscribed and uniform geographical area, we can draw maps whose isolines will join all the points with the same proportion of alleles. The geographical distribution of such genetic frequencies can yield indications and instruments of measurement of the greatest interest for the study of the evolutionary mechanisms that generate genetic differences between human populations. But their interpretation involves quite complex problems. When two human populations are genetically similar, the resemblance may be the result of a common historical origin, but it can also be due to their settlement in similar physical (for example, climatic) environments. Nor should we forget that styles of life and cultural attitudes of an analogous nature (for example, dietary regimes) can favour the increase or decrease to the point of extinction of certain genes. 8. Why do genes (and hence their frequencies) vary over time and space? They do so because the DNA sequences of which they are composed can change by accident. Such change, or mutation,

occurs very rarely, and when it happens, it persists equally rarely in a given population in the long run. Most of the genes of which we have knowledge undergo a mutation about every million generations. From an evolutionary point of view, the mechanism of mutation is very important because it introduces innovations; but since our species of Homo sapiens has existed only for some thousands of generations, it is very improbable that mutations exclusive to our species have contributed significantly to the differences that make one population, or one individual, genetically distinct from another. We should rather think of different versions of the same genes that pre-existed the origin of our species, and over time have acquired a different incidence in different populations. The evolutionary mechanism capable of changing the genetic structure of a population most swiftly is natural selection, which favours the genetic types best adapted for survival to sexual maturity, or with a higher fertility. Natural selection, whose action is continuous over time, having to eliminate mutations that are injurious in a given habitat, is the mechanism that adapts a population to the environment that surrounds it, be this tropical, temperate or arctic. The speed of this adaptive process can be quantified and predicted on the basis of the relative distribution of each genetic type transmitted from one generation to the next. Another evolutionary mechanism is random genetic drift. It is the result of the fact that each new generation is produced by a random sample of the genes present in the preceding generation. Take the example of the founders of a new colony on a remote island, with few contacts with the outside world. If by pure chance these founders lack a gene, that gene will disappear from the entire population of the island. Since each generanon can be considered a population sample founding the next

103

generation, the smaller a given population and the greater its isolation, the wider may be the fluctuations of the frequency of a gene from one generation to the next. Unlike natural selection which favours or penalizes single genes, random genetic drift influences all genes in the same way, altering the frequency of each.
Migration, the mechanism that unites two physically and genetically separate populations, also acts simultaneously on all genes, but more consistently than random genetic drift. Individuals of population A who emigrate to population B modifY the genetic frequencies of population B, rendering it more like population A, with all the genetic frequencies changing in the same direction.

Of these evolutionary mechanisms, genetic drift is the only one consistent with a phylogenetic representation constructed as a tree of evolution-that is, a series of successive separations of population. A tree offers a good image of the evolution of human populations only when the population depicted on each branch of the tree evolves (that is, changes its genetic frequencies) independently of the changes occurring in the populations on the other branches. There is a good statistical correspondence between the genetic data and some evolutionary trees of human differentiation: one that is all the better when the populations in question are geographically and genetically distant from each other-which is what we would expect, given that the more distant the populations are from each other, the less can their evolutions correlate after their separation. If, on the other hand, we look at European populations, among whom well-known pre-historic and historic migrations have led to mixtures that make independent changes among them highly improbable, the image of a tree is not a good representation of evolution. Another result of the elaboration of real data is that

the branches representing the evolution of various populations are of different lengths, as if the pace of change of each population were measured by clocks of different speeds. This reflects the fact that genetic drift produces a greater change in small and isolated populations, while migration can slow down such change by 'mixing' the genes of populations in the same territory, thus reducing the differences induced by genetic drift. In other words, the rates of evolutionary change can vary from population to population: a population that has undergone many migrations (and is therefore very diverse internally but probably less distinct from other populations) evolves less rapidly-is perched on a shorter branch of the tree-than a population that is isolated (hence rather uniform internally but probably more distinct from other populations). For the historical reasons already adduced, European populations are among those that show a slower rate of evolution than others, and for this reason too it could be misleading to reconstruct their evolution over time in the simple form of a tree.

Evolution ofliterary form
9· To find out at what point a biological metaphor ceases to be such, and becomes an appropriate research instrument for the history ofliterary forms, we need to see if the evolutionary mechanisms· that produce biological changes-mutations, natural selection, genetic drift and migration-have their counterparts in those active on literary forms. Let me venture some hypotheses. In the first place, the evolutionary mechanisms in the biology and culture ofour species manifest interesting correspondences. If we take language as a cultural phenomenon par excellence, of the four mechanisms that govern our genetic change, we can say that: migration influences genes and languages in the same way; selection operates in both fields-natural selection favour-

ing the phenotype best adapted to survive, and cultural selection the reciprocal lexical and phonetic intelligibility of language; mutation and linguistic innovation perform the same functiongenerating changes which, after occurring by chance in single individuals, are then adopted by other individuals. Turning more specifically from language to literary form, migration is certainly a factor of change. Graphs, Maps, Trees does not tell us how far translation of the same novel into different languages may alter the reception and success of a literary genre in the country where it is translated, but Moretti's findings in the third chapter of Atlas of the European Novel, on literary diffusion and the correlation between literary models and geographical space, suggest an important role for migration, not of people but of 'forms', at least in Europe. Just as natural selection in biology denotes the selection of the biological type that best survives in the given environment, so there is no doubt that some literary forms have more success than others and survive longer thanks to multiple cultural and economic factors of which the graphs in the first chapter of this book (for example, figures 3 to ro) furnish ample and valuable illustration. There is no need to spend many words on mutation, which, by analogy with the biological mechanism, could supply the factors capable of originating a new literary form: as in biology (where mutations of DNA are caused by the most varied agents), such factors are presumably quite diverse, but it is less important to identifY their exact nature than to be sure of their existence. Figure r of 'Graphs' seems more than convincing on this score. What remains to establish is the existence of an evolutionary mechanism analogous to random genetic drift, an extremely delicate task because-as I have explained above-the significance of evolutionary trees in biology depends in large measure on the presence or absence of this mechanism.

ro. A genetic trait can differ profoundly from a cultural typology not only in the evolutionary mechanisms that generate variability, but also in the mechanism whereby such variability is transmitted. While in biology the transmission of information can occur only from parent to child, cultural transmission can make use of other mechanisms. According to the schema proposed by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman in their Cultural Transmission and Evolution. A Quantitative Approach (Princeton r98r), there are four possible modes of relation between subject and object in the transmission of information:
A) From parent to child (vertical). This is the mechanism that diffuses biological information, working slowly but selected to preserve inter-individual variability. B) From one individual to another (horizontal). This is a mecha· nism analogous to contagion in an epidemic, where information spreads rapidly.

C) From one to several individuals (for example, from a teacher to pupils
or a leader to followers). This is the most effective mechanism for the diffusion of an innovation in a social group. D) From several individuals to a single individual. This is the mecha· nism of social pressure: it generally thwarts the diffusion of an innovation.

What is the mechanism of transmission most relevant to literary genres? Even if mechanism A played a pre-eminent role in the past, and explains those links between genes and languages that we can still recognize today, it is clear that the diffusion of a literary genre cannot dispense with a market that favours mechanism C. The family, which has hitherto ensured the transmission not only of genes but of culture, gives way to the figure of the leader- the novelist, if the genre in question is the novel: the transmission of information runs from the single individual to several individuals. The evolutionary mechanism

known as genetic drift acquires in this context especial relevance. As explained, in genetics drift is the phenomenon whereby the smaller a population, the more frequently genes display only one variant. This is something we readily observe in surnames, which can be considered comparable to the genes to be found in the male chromosome Y: in a country with few inhabitants the number of identical surnames tends to increase, reaching roo per cent if the population is composed of just a single individual. In evolutionary terms, drift reduces the genetic diversity of the population, and therewith its adaptive capacity. Now the cultural mechanism of transmission from one to several individuals represents the most extreme case of such drift: it is as if a single individual transmitted his genes to an entire population, thus reducing and progressively extinguishing genetic diversity. In other words: cultural drift could diffuse cultural information significantly faster, but at the price of reducing it. Moretti's data suggest that the evolution ofliterary forms has been possible till now, or till yesterday, because of their high capacity for innovation, illustrated in figure 9 of 'Graphs', plotting the English novel from 1740 to r9oo. An evolutionary equilibrium between genetic drift, which tends towards homogeneity (and so non-evolution), and mutation, which tends towards innovation, is the condition-well studied at a theoretical level-of hereditary pathologies in isolated populations. Biological reality, as always, is more complex, because natural selection also comes into play if the hereditary pathology is lethal (or less dramatically but more rarely, if treatment exists for it), ·with results that depend on the relative weight of the three factors at work. It is easy to imagine that literary genres also undergo the influence of factors of cultural selection, which have to be studied in the social-historical context (see, for example, the problem of change in literary publics posed by the appearance and disappearance at regular intervals

of the English novelistic genres). The challenge here is to dis· tinguish between the various layers of the term 'environment', which students of biological evolution, as of other disciplines, are fond of using with casual vagueness. A still more radical challenge, putting in question the formulation of quantitative models themselves, is posed by the possibly non-linear nature of such factors: the existence of cyclical patterns of behaviour, for instance, like those revealed in figures 7 and 8 on the hegemonic forms of the English novel in the r8-r9th centuries, is always the sign-also in biology-of the presence of non-linear phenomena. The fact, then, that non-linear phenomena are the norm and not the exception (one need only think of the simple phenomenon of growth in any discipline) constitutes one of the major limits to the development of quantitative models in every field of knowledge today.

Trees
II.

Trees in general, such as those to be found in figures 28 and 29, are representations composed of a series of successive bifurcations, that depict with maximum economy all the reciprocal 'distances'-or overall diversification-between whatever objects are in question. For example the first tree (figure 28), which may not be easy to read for those viewing such a representation for the first time, illustrates a trait that 'diverges' over time--that is, changes in a succession of variants (in the figure, from bottom to top), of which only some persist through all the diversifications made possible by natural selection to date (represented in the figure by the horizontal line higher up). This is a tree which represents the divergence of a trait over time, or the distance of the trait in question from the moment of its initial observation to that of its final observation after a certain lapse of time. To make the representation clearer, let us suppose the trait is a gene, and that this gene is the sequence of DNA made up of

ro8

109

five elements which I designate AATTC (the real name to which the letters refer is irrelevant). The gene evolves over time-that is, changes. To represent this change in the form of a tree, I must define both a point of departure (the 'root' of the tree) and a line that joins the root to a point representing the moment at which the first change happens, which we may imagine as altering the third element from T to G. A mutation has occurred in the gene AATTC, which becomes the gene AAGTC. From now on the two genes AATTC and AAGTC coexist, and their coexistence is represented by a bifurcation of the tree. Such a point (or time) of bifurcation is called a 'node' of the tree. Every successive episode of diversification can be represented analogously by a node at which a bifurcation originates, and the tree as a whole becomes a succession of bifurcations, at the end of which (that is, at the extremity of the tree which will usually represent the present) we have as many genes that have mutated from the original in the root of the tree as there are bifurcations plus r, unless some of these have become extinct through natural selection. The non-extinct genes which appear at the extremity of the tree are technically called its 'leaves'. What I have just described is the 'phylogenetic tree' of the gene, in the sense that it depicts its evolutionary phylogenesis over time from an initial gene. The reality of the data available to us is, however, quite different. We know the genes that are present today (the leaves of the tree) and we want to infer, without knowing them, the various transitions that have led from the root to the current situation. The phylogenetic tree is thus 'reconstructed' by a process of retrospecti~e inference, based on an evolutionary model. For example, rt rs generally assumed that evolution proceeds at the same rate of change along all branches of the tree; that changes from one node to another are the least possible; that natural selection does not operate; that we cannot find the same change simultaneously in different branches of the tree. It is very important to understand that a tree-like structure (technically a 'topology')

cannot reflect the phylogenesis of the object in question if its evolutionary history is not consistent with the assumptions on which the process of inference is based. Awareness of this is all the more important today, when intensive and often heedless use of computers is capable of generating trees of any aggregate of objects whose reciprocal distance is known. With most of the algorithms now in use, the tree will merely reproduce a topology in which the objects closest to one another will be separated by a lesser number of nodes, and those more distant from each other by a larger number; but it can have no pretension to be a phylogenetic description if the algorithm employed is not congruent with a reasonable model of evolution, whose mechanisms have been explicitly formulated. r2. The tree represented in figure 29 differs from figure 28. Its leaves are not different variants of the same trait or gene, but different linguistic populations or families, distributed across the five continents. What are the relations between the two types of tree and what assumptions are required for testing the phylogenetic validity of the evolutionary tree of human linguistic populations or families? We need to remember that each individual in our species has about 3o-so,ooo genes, and that every population is composed of many individuals, whose history we assume to be common, at least as regards geographical settlement. Since each individual differs from the next by about two per thousand (or 0.2%) ofhis or her DNA, itis reasonable to think that the evolution over time of a gene, or an individual, or a population, will have different rates of changes, and thus different evolutionary trees, that will certainly be correlated but in an unpredictable way. The only certain relationship is that bifurcations in the tree of populations must occur later than bifurcations in the genes of the individuals who compose them: this temporal lag is due to the fact that the individuals of one population differ from those of another by cumulative mutations within many genes and not

a single gene. Still, this important distinction between trees of genes and trees of populations is of little interest if the leaves in question are cultural traits like literary genres. More mteresting, however, are two properties of the phylogenetic trees drawn from the study of biological evolution:
A) If the tree is used to infer the times at which bifurcation occurred, the changes through all the branches, from root to leaves, it is necessary for the changes of the branches, from root to leaves, to occur at a constant speed. This is realistic enough in trees of genes, in so far as single genes vary over time at a roughly constant rate. But it is not realistic in trees of populations, where the variability of genes and individuals is cumulative, and the demography of each population can speed up or slow down change. In other words, here every branch has its own specific rate of variation. B) A real tree of life would foresee not only bifurcations, but trifurcations, quadrifurcations etc, and still more importan:, ~e possibili:tY that once diversified, two or more populations can JOlll together m a reticular weave where genes and cultures not only diverge but converge, as depicted in Kroeber's tree of culture reproduced in figure 32. That the tree in figure 29 is a fairly realistic representation of the evolution of human populations and languages depends

'3-

on the fact that the populations are geographically distant and
distinct from one another, and that the number of mutual 'borrowings' between linguistic 'families' is reasonably smalL If one were to apply the same tree structure to European populations, it would become evident that the model of successive bifurcations is incomplete, since the network of migrations between different countries would create a reticular structure that could not be confined to tree-like form. From a practical standpoint, however, the development of reticular models is a much more complex, not to say currently impossible, task; so for the moment we must co~tent ourselves with testing the hypothesis that the data can be explamed

These methodological remarks make possible a spedfic comment on the trees presented in the third chapter of this book. Figure 30 represents the phylogenesis of the English detective story, where clues constitute the morphological trait (in biology we would speak of a 'phenotype') that changes over time. This is a tree of the type that tracks changes in a gene and it is easy to reconstruct a biological image of it. Corresponding to each mutation, the nodes of the tree, are enumerated the populations (or individuals) in which the mutant gene is to be found. From a study of the distribution of the populations or individuals associated with each node-that is, the mutation which the node represents-we can infer the 'adaptive' value of the mutation for the individual or the population, in other words whether or not the mutation has been 'chosen' by natural selection to confer an advantage (which is then its presence) or a disadvantage (its absence) on the individual or population. In the tree of clues and the tree of the gene the problem lies not in their topology but, as Moretti himself acknowledges, in the selection and completeness of the clues (mutations) taken into consideration. In order to avoid a drcular argument, caution would also suggest that the selection of detective stories and that of clues should be not only as complete as possible, but also independent of each other. The last tree offered and analysed in this book depicts the evolution from r8oo till today of the narrative technique known as 'free indirect style'. It is reproduced in figure 33· In this bold experiment of comparative morphology, the idea we have noted in Moretti's account of the Bildungsroman returns: that there exists a relation between spatial discontinuity and morphological innovation. This is one of the most stimulating findings of Graphs, Maps, Trees. In Moretti's words, 'a new species (or at any rate a new formal arrangement), arising when a population migrates into a new homeland, and must quicldy change

with the model of a tree. in the knowledge that if this hypothesis
is not statistically proven, the alternative hypothesis of a reticular structure is the more probable.

in order to survive. Just like free indirect style when it moves into Petersburg. Aci Trezza. Dublin, Ciudad Trujillo .. .'.We are dealing, in a literary metaphor, with that 'allopatric speciation' which Ernst Mayr postulated in the 1940s and sos to account for the birth of different species of birds in the same habitat by exclusive effect of geographical distance and lack of geneti~ exchange. The adoption of a similar model for new stylistic vanants, or cultural traits, presupposes that the various branches of the tree cannot exchange information: in the case offree indirect style under consideration, this condition is secured by linguistic discontinuities, but in other applications it would have to be established case by case.

Epilogue

'+

The stimuli offered by this book of Franco Moretti's are many and fascinating, and my remarks are intended as a tribute to them from one who is not a practitioner of the same field, but would like to respond to its challenge. In that spirit, let me end with a reflection. Phylogenetic trees representing biological evolution presuppose an absence and a presence: absence of the effects of natural selection and presence of mutation, migration and random genetic drift. That is not because natural selection is held to be oflittle weight, but because it can operate in many different ways and its effect on the branches of the tree may be to make them either diverge or converge. In so ambiguous and unpredictable a situation, it is better to assume that natural selection has no effect, and then to confirm or fals1fy th1s hypothesis statistically. By contrast in all the trees representing the evolution of different literary forms in Moretti's book, cultural selection-the survival or extinction of one form rather than another-is the principal operator. This different approach probably reflects different questions. The student of biological evolution is especially interested in the root of the tree (the time

it originated). For inferring this origin, direct consideration of natural selection is an encumbrance to be avoided, by studying the effect of many genes whose relative weights can be ignored because divergences and convergences cancel each other out. The student of literary evolution, on the other hand, is interested not so much in the root of the tree (because it is situated in a known historical epoch) as in its trajectory, or metamorphoses. This is an interest much closer to study of the evolution of a gene, the particular nature of whose mutations, and the filter operated by natural selection, one wants to understand. It is only today, when we know the human genome and. can deploy very powerful technologies of molecular biology, that the possibility of retracing the history of all the mutations of a gene across its (and our) evolution has ceased to be illusory. In their wide-open challenge, I have found in Moretti's conjectures an incentive to refine the means of reading our evolution. I would be happy if it were so for other readers too.
