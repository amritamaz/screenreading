Reston w r o t e i n The ( J u l y 7, 1957):

York

A health director . . . reported this week that a small mouse, which presumably had been watching television, attacked a little girl and her full-grown cat. . . . Both mouse and cat survived, and the incident is recorded here as a reminder that things seem to be changing. A f t e r three thousand years o f explosion, b y means o f fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the Wester n w o r l d is imploding . D u r i n g the mechanical ages w e had extended our bodies i n space. T o day, after more than a century o f elect r i c technology, w e have extended o u r central nervous system itself i n a global embrace, abolishing b o t h space and time as far as our planet is concerned. R a p i d l y , w e approach the final phase o f the extensions of man--the technological simulation o f consciousness, w h e n the creative process o f k n o w i n g w i l l be collectively and cor-

porately extended to the w h o l e o f human society, m u c h as w e have already extended our senses and our nerves b y the various media. W h e t h e r the extension of consciousness, so l o n g sought b y advertisers f o r specific products, w i l l be "a good t h i n g " is a question that admits o f a w i d e solution. T h e r e is little possibility of answering such questions about the extensions o f man w i t h o u t considering all o f t h e m together. A n y extension, whether o f skin, hand, or f o o t , affects the w h o l e psychic and social complex. Some o f the principal extensions, together w i t h some of their psychic and social consequences, are studied i n this book. Just h o w l i t t l e consideration has been given to such matters i n the past can be gathered f r o m the consternation o f one o f the editors of this book. H e noted i n dismay that "seventy-five per cent of y o u r material is new. A successful book cannot venture to be more than ten per cent n e w . " Such a risk seems quite w o r t h taking at the present t i me w h e n the stakes are v e r y high, and the need t o understand the effects of the extensions o f man becomes more u r gent b y the hour. I n the mechanical age n o w receding, many actions could be taken w i t h o u t too m u c h concern. Slow movement insured that the reactions w e r e delayed f o r considerable periods o f time. T o d a y the action and the reaction occur almost at the same time. W e actually live m y t h i c a l l y and integrally, as i t were, b u t w e continue t o t h i n k i n the o l d , fragmented space and t i m e patterns of the pre-electric age. W e s t e r n man acquired f r o m the technology of literacy the p o w e r t o act w i t h o u t reacting. T h e advantages o f fragmenting himself i n this w a y are seen i n the case o f the surgeon w h o w o u l d be quite helpless i f he were t o become humanly involved i n his operation. W e acquired the art o f c a r r y i n g o u t the most dangerous social operations w i t h complete detachment. B u t our detachment was a posture o f noninvolvement. I n the electric age, w h e n our central nervous system is technologically extended to involve us i n the w h o l e of m a n k i n d and t o incorporate the whole of mankind i n us, w e necessarily participate, i n depth, i n the consequences o f our every action. I t is no longer possible to adopt the aloof and dissociated role o f the literate Westerner.

Introduction/S T h e Theater o f the A b s u r d dramatizes this recent dilemma o f Western man, the man o f action w h o appears n o t to be involved i n the action. Such is the o r i g i n and appeal o f Samuel Beckett's clowns. A f t e r three thousand years of specialist explosion and o f increasing specialism and alienation i n the technological extensions o f our bodies, our w o r l d has become compressional b y dramatic reversal. As electrically contracted, the globe is no more than a village. Electric speed i n b r i n g i n g all social and political functions together i n a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness o f responsibility t o an intense degree. I t is this implosive factor that alters the position o f the N e g r o , the teen-ager, and some other groups. T h e y can no longer be contained, i n the political sense o f limited association. T h e y are n o w involved i n our lives, as w e i n theirs, thanks to the electric media. T h i s is the A g e o f A n x i e t y f o r the reason of the electric implosion that compels commitment and participation, quite regardless o f any " p o i n t of v i e w . " T h e partial and specialized character o f the v i e w p o i n t , however noble, w i l l n o t serve at all i n the electric age. A t the i n f o r m a t i o n level the same upset has occurred w i t h the substitution o f the inclusive image f o r the mere viewpoint. I f the nineteenth c e n t u r y was the age of the editorial chair, ours is the century o f the psychiatrist's couch. As extension o f man the chair is a specialist ablation of the posterior, a sort of ablative absolute of backside, whereas the couch extends the integral being. T h e psychiatrist employs the couch, since i t removes the temptation t o express private points o f v i e w and obviates the need t o rationalize events. T h e aspiration o f our time f o r wholeness, empathy and depth o f awareness is a natural adjunct o f electric technology. T h e age o f mechanical i n d u s t r y that preceded us f o u n d vehement assert i o n o f private o u t l o o k the natural mode o f expression. E v e r y c u l ture and every age has its favorite model o f perception and knowledge that i t is inclined t o prescribe f o r everybody and everyt h i n g . T h e mark o f o u r time is its revulsion against imposed patterns. W e are suddenly eager t o have things and people declare their beings t o t a l l y . T h e r e is a deep f a i t h t o be f o u n d i n this new attitude--a faith that concerns the ultimate harmony o f all

6/Understanding

being. Such is the faith i n w h i c h this book has been w r i t t e n . I t explores the contours o f our o w n extended beings i n our technologies, seeking the principle o f i n t e l l i g i b i l i ty i n each o f them. I n the f u l l confidence that i t is possible t o w i n an understanding o f these forms that w i l l b r i n g them into o r d e r l y service, I have looked at them anew, accepting v e r y little of the conventional wisdom concerning them. One can say o f media as R o b e rt T h e o bald has said o f economic depressions: " T h e r e is one additional factor that has helped to c o n t r o l depressions, and that is a better understanding of their development." Examination of the origin and development o f the individual extensions o f man should be preceded b y a look at some general aspects of the media, or extensions o f man, beginning w i t h the never-explained numbness that each extension brings about i n the individual and society.

1 The Medium Is the Message

I n a culture like ours, l o n g accustomed t o splitting and d i v i d i n g all things as a means o f c o n t r o l , i t is sometimes a b i t o f a shock t o be reminded that, i n operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. T h i s is merely t o say that the personal and social consequences o f any medium--that is, o f any extension of ourselves--result f r o m the new scale that is introduced into our affairs b y each extension of ourselves, or b y any ne w technology. T h u s , w i t h automation, f o r example, the new patterns o f human association tend t o eliminate jobs, i t is true. T h a t is the negative result. Positively, automation creates roles f o r people, w h i c h is t o say depth o f involvement i n their w o r k and human association that our preceding mechanical technolo g y had destroyed. M a n y people w o u l d be disposed t o say that i t was n o t the machine, b u t w h a t one d i d w i t h the machine, that was its meaning or message. I n terms of the ways i n w h i c h the machine

altered our relations t o one another and to ourselves, i t mattered n o t i n the least whether i t t u r n e d o u t cornflakes or Cadillacs. T h e restructuring o f human w o r k and association was shaped b y the technique o f fragmentation that is the essence o f machine technology. T h e essence o f automation technology is the opposite. I t is integral and decentralist i n depth, just as the machine was f r a g mentary, centralist, and superficial i n its patterning of human relationships. T h e instance o f the electric l i g h t m a y prove illuminating i n this connection. T h e electric l i g h t is pure i n f o r m a t i o n . I t is a medium w i t h o u t a message, as i t were, unless i t is used t o spell out some verbal ad or name. T h i s fact, characteristic o f all media, means that the " c o n t e n t " o f any mediu m is always another medium. T h e content o f w r i t i n g is speech, just as the w r i t t e n w o r d is the content o f p r i n t , and p r i n t is the content o f the telegraph. I f i t is asked, " W h a t is the content o f speech?," i t is necessary t o say, " I t is an actual process o f thought , w h i c h is i n itself nonverbal." A n abstract painting represents direct manifestation o f creative t h o u g h t processes as they m i g h t appear i n computer designs. W h a t w e are considering here, however, are the psychic and social consequences o f the designs or patterns as they a m p l i f y or accelerate existing processes. F or the "message" of any medium or technology is the change o f scale or pace or pattern that i t introduces i n t o human affairs. T h e r a i l w a y d i d n o t i n t r o duce movement or transportation or wheel or road into human society, b u t i t accelerated and enlarged the scale of previous human functions, creating t o t a l l y new kinds o f cities and new kinds o f w o r k and leisure. T h i s happened whether the r a i l w ay functioned i n a tropical or a n o r t h e r n environment, and is quite independent o f the f r e i g h t o r content o f the r a i l w a y medium. T h e airplane, o n the other hand, b y accelerating the rate o f transportation, tends t o dissolve the r a i l w a y f o r m o f c i t y , politics, and association, quite independently o f w h a t the airplane is used for. L e t us r e t u r n to the electric light. W h e t h e r the l i g h t is being used f o r brain surgery or n i g h t baseball is a matter o f indifference.

I t could be argued that these activities are i n some w a y the " c o n t e n t " o f the electric l i g h t , since they c o u l d n o t exist w i t h o u t the electric light. T h i s fact merely underlines the p o i n t that "the medium is the message" because i t is the m e d i u m that shapes and controls the scale and f o r m o f human association and action. T h e content or uses o f such media are as diverse as they are ineffectual in shaping the f o r m o f human association. Indeed, i t is o n l y too typical that the " c o n t e n t " o f any m e d i u m blinds us t o the character o f the medium. I t is o n l y today that industries have become aware o f the various kinds o f business i n w h i c h t h e y are engaged. W h e n I B M discovered that i t was n o t i n the business o f making office equipment or business machines, b u t that i t was i n the business o f processing i n f o r m a t i o n , then i t began to navigate w i t h clear vision. T h e General Electric Company makes a considerable p o r t i o n o f its profits f r o m electric l i g h t bulbs and l i g h t i n g systems. I t has n o t y e t discovered that, quite as m u c h as A . T . & T . , i t is i n the business of m o v i n g i n f o r m a t i o n . T h e electric l i g h t escapes attention as a communication medium just because i t has no "content. " A n d this makes i t an invaluable instance o f h o w people fail t o study media at all. F o r i t is n o t t i l l the electric l i g h t is used t o spell out some brand name that i t is noticed as a medium. T h e n i t is n o t the l i g h t b u t the " c o n t e n t " ( o r w h a t is really another m e d i u m ) that is noticed. T h e message o f the electric l i g h t is l i k e the message o f electric p o w e r i n industry, t o t a l l y radical, pervasive, and decentralized. F o r electric light and p o w e r are separate f r o m their uses, y e t t h e y eliminate time and space factors i n human association exactly as do radio, telegraph, telephone, and T V , creating involvement i n depth. A f a i r l y complete handbook f o r s t u d y i n g the extensions o f man could be made u p f r o m selections f r o m Shakespeare. Some m i g h t quibble about whether or n o t he was r e f e r r i n g t o T V i n these familiar lines f r o m Romeo and Juliet: But soft! what light through yonder window breaks? I t speaks, and yet says nothing. I n Othello, w h i c h , as m u c h as King Lear, is concerned w i t h the tormen t of people transformed b y illusions, there are these

10 /Understanding

lines that bespeak Shakespeare's i n t u i t i o n o f the transforming powers of n e w media: Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abus'd? Have y o u not read Roderigo, O f some such thing? I n Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, w h i c h is almost completely devoted t o b o t h a psychic and social study of communication, Shakespeare states his awareness that true social and political navigation depend u p o n anticipating the consequences of i n novation: The providence that's i n a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold, Finds bottom i n the uncomprehensive deeps, Keeps place w i t h thought, and almost like the gods Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles. T h e increasing awareness o f the action o f media, quite i n dependently of their " c o n t e n t " or p r o g r a m m i n g, was indicated i n the annoyed and anonymous stanza: I n modern thought, ( i f not i n fact) Nothing is that doesn't act, So that is reckoned wisdom which Describes the scratch but not the itch. T h e same k i n d o f total, configurational awareness that reveals w h y the m e d i u m is socially the message has occurred i n the most recent and radical medical theories. I n his Stress of Life, Hans Selye tells of the dismay o f a research colleague o n hearing o f Selye's t h e o r y : W h e n he saw me thus launched on yet another enraptured description of what I had observed i n animals treated w i t h this or that impure, toxic material, he looked at me w i t h desperately sad eyes and said i n obvious despair: "But Selye, t r y to realize what you are doing before i t is too late! You have now decided to spend your entire life studying the pharmacology of d i r t ! " (Hans Selye, The Stress of Life)

As Selye deals w i t h the total environmental situation i n his "stress" theory o f disease, so the latest approach t o media study considers not o n l y the " c o n t e n t " b u t the mediu m and the cultural matrix w i t h i n w h i c h the particular m e d i u m operates. T h e older unawareness of the psychic and social effects o f media can be illustrated f r o m almost any o f the conventional pronouncements. I n accepting an honorary degree f r o m the U n i v e r s i t y o f N o t r e Dame a f e w years ago, General D a v i d SarnofF made this statement: " W e are too prone t o make technological instruments the scapegoats f o r the sins o f those w h o w i e l d them. T h e products o f modern science are n o t i n themselves good or bad; i t is the w a y they are used that determines their value." T h a t is the voice o f the current somnambulism. Suppose w e were t o say, " A p p l e pie is i n itself neither good nor bad; i t is the w a y i t is used that determines its value." O r , " T h e smallpox virus is i n itself neither good n o r bad; i t is the w a y i t is used that determines its value." A g a i n , "Firearms are i n themselves neither good nor bad; i t is the w a y they are used that determines their value." T h a t is, i f the slugs reach the r i g h t people firearms are good. I f the T V tube fires the r i g h t ammunition at the r i g h t people i t is good. I am n o t being perverse. T h e r e is s i m p l y n o t h i n g i n the Sarnoff statement that w i l l bear scrutiny, f o r i t ignores the nature o f the medium, o f any and all media, i n the true Narcissus style o f one hypnotized b y the amputation and extension o f his o w n being i n a n e w technical f o r m ! General Sarnoff w e n t o n t o explain his attitude t o the technology of p r i n t , saying that i t was true that p r i n t caused m u c h trash t o circulate, b u t i t had also disseminated the Bible and the thoughts o f seers and philosophers. I t has never occurred t o General Sarnoff that any technology c o u l d do a n y t h i n g b u t add itself o n t o w h a t w e already are. Such economists as Robert Theobald, W . W . Rostow, and John Kenneth Galbraith have been explaining f o r years h o w i t is that "classical economics" cannot explain change or g r o w t h . A n d the paradox o f mechanization is that although i t is itself the cause o f maximal g r o w t h and change, the principle o f mechanization excludes the v e r y possibility of g r o w t h or the understanding o f change. For mechanization is achieved b y fragmentation of any

\2/Understanding

process and b y p u t t i n g the fragmented parts i n a series. Yet, as D a v i d H u m e showed i n the eighteenth century, there is no principle o f causality i n a mere sequence. T h a t one t h i n g follows another accounts f o r n o t h i n g . N o t h i n g f o l l o w s f r o m f o l l o w i n g , except change. So the greatest o f all reversals occurred w i t h electricity, that ended sequence b y making things instant. W i t h instant speed the causes o f things began t o emerge t o awareness again, as they had n o t done w i t h things i n sequence and i n concatenation accordingly. Instead o f asking w h i c h came first, the chicken o r the egg, i t suddenly seemed that a chicken was an egg's idea f o r getting more eggs. Just before an airplane breaks the sound barrier, sound waves become visible o n the wings of the plane. T h e sudden visibility o f sound just as sound ends is an apt instance of that great pattern o f being that reveals new and opposite forms just as the earlier forms reach their peak performance. Mechanization was never so v i v i d l y fragmented or sequential as i n the b i r t h o f the movies, the moment that translated us beyond mechanism i n t o the w o r l d o f g r o w t h and organic interrelation. T h e movie, b y sheer speeding u p the mechanical, carried us f r o m the w o r l d o f sequence and connections i n t o the w o r l d o f creative configuration and structure. T h e message o f the movie medium is that o f transition f r o m lineal connections t o configurations. I t is the transition that produced the n o w quite correct observation: " I f i t w o r k s , it's obsolete." W h e n electric speed f u r t h e r takes over f r o m mechanical movie sequences, then the lines o f force i n structures and i n media become l o u d and clear. W e r e t u r n t o the inclusive f o r m of the i c o n . T o a h i g h l y literate and mechanized culture the movie appeared as a w o r l d o f t r i u m p h a n t illusions and dreams that money could b u y . I t was at this m o m e n t o f the movie that cubism occurred, and i t has been described b y E. H . G o m b r i c h (Art and Illusion) as " t h e most radical attempt t o stamp out ambiguit y and t o enforce one reading of the picture--that o f a man-made construction, a colored canvas." F o r cubism substitutes all facets of an object simultaneously f o r the " p o i n t o f v i e w " or facet o f perspective illusion. Instead o f the specialized illusion o f the t h i r d

The

dimension on canvas, cubism sets up an interplay o f planes and contradiction or dramatic conflict o f patterns, lights, textures that "drives home the message" b y involvement. T h i s is held b y many to be an exercise i n painting, n o t i n illusion. I n other words, cubism, b y giving the inside and outside, the top, b o t t o m , back, and f r o n t and the rest, i n t w o dimensions, drops the illusion of perspective i n favor o f instant sensory awareness o f the w h o l e . Cubism, b y seizing o n instant total awareness, suddenly announced that the medium is the message. Is i t n o t evident that the moment that sequence yields t o the simultaneous, one is i n the w o r l d o f the structure and o f configuration? Is that n o t w h a t has happened i n physics as i n painting, p o e t r y , and i n communication? Specialized segments o f attention have shifted t o total field, and w e can n o w say, " T h e m e d i u m is the message" quite naturally. Before the electric speed and t o t a l field, i t was n o t obvious that the medium is the message. T h e message, i t seemed, was the " c o n t e n t , " as people used t o ask w h a t a painting was abotét. Y e t t h e y never thought to ask w h a t a m e l o dy was about, nor w h a t a house or a dress was about. I n such matters, people retained some sense of the w h o l e pattern, o f f o r m and f u n c t i o n as a u n i t y . B u t i n the electric age this integral idea o f structure and configuration has become so prevalent that educational t h e o r y has taken u p the matter. Instead o f w o r k i n g w i t h specialized "problems" i n a r i t h metic, the structural approach n o w f o l l o w s the linea o f force i n the field o f number and has small children meditating about n u m ber theory and "sets." Cardinal N e w m a n said o f Napoleon, " H e understood the grammar o f g u n p o w d e r . " Napoleo n had paid some attention t o other media as w e l l , especially the semaphore telegraph that gave h i m a great advantage over his enemies. H e is o n record f o r saying that " T h r e e hostile newspapers are m o r e t o be feared than a thousand bayonets." Alexis de Tocqueville was the first t o master the grammar o f p r i n t and t y p o g r a p h y . H e was thus able t o read off the message o f c o m i n g change i n France and America as i f he were reading aloud f r o m a text that had been handed t o h i m . In, fact, the nineteenth century i n France and i n A m e r i c a was just such an

open book t o de Tocqueville because he had learned the grammar o f p r i n t . So he, also, k n e w w h e n that grammar d i d n o t apply. H e was asked w h y he d i d n o t w r i t e a book o n England, since he k n e w and admired England. H e replied: One would have to have an unusual degree of philosophical folly to believe oneself able to judge England i n six months. A year always seemed to me too short a time i n which to appreciate the United States properly, and i t is much easier to acquire clear and precise notions about the American Union than about Great Britain. I n America all laws derive in a sense f r o m the same line of thought. The whole of society, so to speak, is founded upon a single fact; everything springs f r o m a simple principle. One could compare America to a forest pierced by a multitude of straight roads all converging on the same point. One has only to find the center and everything is revealed at a glance. But i n England the paths r u n criss-cross, and i t is only by travelling down each one of them that one can build up a picture of the whole. D e Tocqueville, i n earlier w o r k o n the French Revolution, had explained h o w i t was the p r i n t e d w o r d that, achieving cultural saturation i n the eighteenth century, had homogenized the French nation. Frenchmen were the same k i n d o f people f r o m n o r t h t o south. T h e typographic principles o f u n i f o r m i t y , c o n t i n u i t y , and lineality had overlaid the complexities of ancient feudal and oral society. T h e R e v o l u t i on was carried o u t b y the n e w literati and lawyers.

I am i n the position o f Louis Pasteur telling doctors that their greatest enemy was quite invisible, and quite unrecognized b y them. O u r conventional response to all media, namely that i t is h o w the y are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the " c o n t e n t " of a m e d i u m is like the j u i c y piece o f meat carried b y the burglar t o distract the w a t c h dog o f the m i n d . T h e effect o f the medium is made strong and intense just because i t is given another medium as "content." T h e content o f a movie is a novel or a play or an opera. T h e effect of the movie f o r m is not related t o its program content. T h e " c o n t e n t " o f w r i t i n g or p r i n t is speech, b u t the reader is almost entirely unaware either of p r i n t or o f speech. A r n o l d T o y n b e e is innocent o f any understanding o f media as they have shaped history, b u t he is f u l l of examples that the student o f media can use. A t one moment he can seriously suggest that adult education, such as the W o r k e r s Educational Associat i o n i n Britain, is a useful counterforce t o the popular press. T o y n bee considers that although all o f the oriental societies have i n our time accepted the industrial technology and its political consequences: " O n the cultural plane, however, there is no u n i f o r m corresponding tendency." (Somervell, I . 267) T h i s is like the voice of the literate man, floundering i n a milieu of ads, w h o boasts, "Personally, I pay no attention to ads." T h e spiritual and cultural reservations that the oriental peoples may have t o w a r d our technology w i l l avail them not at all. T h e effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, b u t alter sense ratios or patterns o f perception steadily and w i t h o u t any resistance.

For the man i n a literate and homogenized society ceases to be sensitive t o the diverse and discontinuous life of forms.

alism i n the sixteenth century. Program and " c o n t e n t " analysis offer no clues to the magic of these media or to their subliminal charge. Leonard D o o b , i n his repor t Communication in Africa, tells of one A f r i c a n w h o t o o k great pains t o listen each evening t o the BBC news, even t h o u g h he could understand n o t h i n g of i t . Just t o be i n the presence of those sounds at 7 P . M . each day was i m p o r t a n t f o r h i m . H i s attitude to speech was like ours t o melody--the resonant intonation was meaning enough. I n the seventeenth century our ancestors still shared this native's attitude t o the forms o f media, as is plain i n the f o l l o w i n g sentiment o f the Frenchman Bernard L a m expressed i n The Art of Speaking ( L o n d o n , 1696): 'Tis an effect of the Wisdom of God, who created Man to be happy, that whatever is useful to his conversation (way of life) is agreeable to him . . . because all victual that conduces to nourishment is relishable, whereas other things that cannot be assimulated and be turned into our substance are insipid. A Discourse cannot be pleasant to the Hearer that is not easie to the Speaker; nor can i t be easily pronounced unless i t be heard w i t h delight. H e r e is an equilibrium t h e o r y of human diet and expression such as even n o w w e are o n l y striving t o w o r k o u t again f o r media after centuries o f fragmentation and specialism. Pope Pius X I I was deeply concerned that there be serious study o f the media today. O n February 17, 1950, he said: I t is not an exaggeration to say that the future of modern society and the stability of its inner life depend i n large part on the maintenance of an equilibrium between the strength of the techniques of communication and the capacity of the individual's own reaction. Failure i n this respect has f o r centuries been t y p i c a l and total f o r m a n k i n d . Subliminal and docile acceptance o f media impact has made them prisons w i t h o u t walls f o r their human users. As A .

T h e result is that the present age has been one o f multiple civil wars that :irc n o t limited to the w o r l d o f art and entertainment. I n War and Human Progress, Professor J. U . N e f declared: " T h e total wars of our time have been the result of a series o f intellectual misrakes . . . " I f the formative p o w e r i n the media are the media themselves, that raises a host o f large matters that can o n l y be mentioned here, although t h e y deserve volumes. N a m e l y , that technological media are staples or natural resources, exactly as are coal and cotton and o i l . A n y b o d y w i l l concede that society whose econo m y is dependent u p o n one or t w o major staples like c o t t o n , or grain, or lumber, or fish, or cattle is going to have some o b vious social patterns o f organization as a result. Stress o n a f e w major staples creates extreme instability i n the economy b u t great endurance i n the population. T h e pathos and humor o f the A m e r i can South are embedded i n such an economy of limited staples. For a society configured b y reliance o n a f e w commodities accepts them as a social b o n d quite as m u c h as the metropolis does the press. C o t t o n and o i l , like radio and T V , become " f i x e d charges" on the entire psychic life o f the c o m m u n i t y . A n d this pervasive fact creates the unique cultural flavor o f any society. I t pays through the nose and all its other senses f o r each staple that shapes its life. T h a t our human senses, o f w h i c h all media are extensions, are also fixed charges on our personal energies, and that t h e y also configure the awareness and experience o f each one o f us, m a y be perceived i n another connection mentioned b y the psychologist C. G . Jung: Every Roman was surrounded by slaves. The slave and his psychology flooded ancient Italy, and every Roman became inwardly, and of course unwittingly, a slave. Because living constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected through the unconscious w i t h their psychology. N o one can shield himself f r o m such an influence (Contributions to Analytical Psychology, London, 1928).

T h e sensuous involvement natural to cultures i n w h i c h literacy is n o t the r u l i n g f o r m of experience is sometimes indicated i n travel guides, as i n this item f r o m a guide to Greece: You w i l l notice that many Greek men seem to spend a lot of time counting the beads of what appear to be amber rosaries. But these have no religious significance. They are komboloia or " w o r r y beads," a legacy f r o m the Turks, and Greeks click them on land, on the sea, i n the air to ward off that insupportable silence which threatens to reign whenever conversation lags. Shepherds do i t , cops do i t , stevedores and merchants in their shops do i t . A n d i f you wonder w h y so few Greek women wear beads, you'll know it's because their husbands have pre-empted them for the simple pleasure of clicking. More aesthetic than thumb-twiddling, less expensive than smoking, this Queeg-like obsession indicates a tactile sensuousness characteristic of a race which has produced the western world's greatest sculpture . . . W h e r e the heavy visual stress of literacy is lacking i n a culture, there occurs another f o r m o f sensuous involvement and cultural appreciation that our Greek guide explains whimsically: . . . do not be surprised at the frequency w i t h which you are patted, petted and prodded in Greece. You may end up feeling like the family dog . . . in an affectionate family. This propensity to pat seems to us a tactile extension of the avid Greek curiosity noted before. It's as though your hosts are trying to find out what you are made of. T h e w i d e l y separate characters of the spoken and w r i t t e n w o r d s are easy t o study today w h e n there is ever closer t o u c h w i t h nonliterate societies. One native, the o n l y literate member o f his group , t o l d o f acting as reader f o r the others w h e n they received letters.

A l t h o u g h phonetic w r i t i n g separates and extends the visual p o w e r o f words, i t is comparat i v e l y crude and slow.

M a n y a page o f prose and m a n y a narrative has been devoted t o expressi n g w h a t was, i n effect, a sob, a moan, a laugh, or a piercing scream.

B u t w r i t i n g tends t o be a k i n d o f separate or specialist action i n w h i c h there is little o p p o r t u n i t y or call f o r reaction. T h e literate man or society develops the tremendous p o w e r o f acting i n any matter w i t h considerable detachment f r o m the feelings or emotional involvement that a nonliterate man or society w o u l d experience. H e n r i Bergson, the French philosopher, lived and w r o t e i n a t r a d i t i o n o f t h o u g h t i n w h i c h i t was and is considered that language is a human technology that has impaired and diminished the values o f the collective unconscious. I t is the extension of man i n speech that enables the intellect t o detach itself f r o m the vastly w i d e r reality. W i t h o u t language, Bergson suggests, human i n telligence w o u l d have remained totally involved i n the objects o f its attention.

and m a n k i n d f r o m the cosmic unconscious. As an extension or u t t e r i n g ( o u t e r i n g ) o f all our senses at once, language has always been held t o be man's richest art f o r m , that w h i c h distinguishes h i m f r o m the animal creation. I f the human ear can be compared t o a radio receiver that is able to decode electromagnetic waves and recode them as sound, the human voice may be compared to the radio transmitter i n being able to translate sound i n t o electromagnetic waves. T h e power of the voice to shape air and space into verbal patterns may w e l l have been preceded b y a less specialized expression of cries, grunts, gestures, and commands, o f song and dance. T h e patterns of the senses that are extended i n the various languages o f men are as varied as styles o f dress and art. Each mother tongue teaches its users a w a y o f seeing and feeling the w o r l d , and of acting i n the w o r l d , that is quite unique. O u r new electric technology that extends our senses and nerves i n a global embrace has large implications f o r the f u t u r e of language. Electric technology does n o t need w o r d s any more than the digital computer needs numbers. E l e c t r i c i t y points the w a y to an extension of the process o f consciousness itself, on a w o r l d scale, and w i t h o u t any verbalization whatever. Such a state o f collective awareness may have been the preverbal conditio n o f men. Language as the technology o f human extension, whose powers o f division and separation w e k n o w so w e l l , m a y have been the " T o w e r of Babel" b y w h i c h men sought t o scale the highest heavens. T o d a y computers h o l d o u t the promise o f a means of instant translation of any code or language i n t o any other code or language.

Because o f its action i n extending our central nervous system, electric technology seems t o favor the inclusive and participational spoken w o r d over the specialist w r i t t e n w o r d . O u r Western values, b u i l t o n the w r i t t e n w o r d , have already been considerably affected b y the electric media of telephone, radio, and T V . Perhaps that is the reason w h y many h i g h l y literate people i n our time find i t difficult t o examine this question w i t h o u t getting into a m o r a l panic. T h e r e is the f u r t h e r circumstance that, d u r i n g his more than t w o thousand years of literacy, W e s t e r n man has done little to study or t o understand the effects o f the phonetic alphabet i n creating many o f his basic patterns of culture. T o begin n o w t o examine the question may, therefore, seem too late. Suppose that, instead o f displaying the Stars and Stripes, w e were t o w r i t e the w o r d s " A m e r i c a n flag" across a piece o f c l o t h and to display that. W h i l e the symbols w o u l d convey the same meaning, the effect w o u l d be quite different. T o translate the r i c h visual mosaic o f the Stars and Stripes into w r i t t e n f o r m w o u l d be t o deprive i t o f most o f its qualities o f corporate image and o f experience, y e t the abstract literal b o n d w o u l d remain m u c h the same. Perhaps this illustration w i l l serve t o suggest the change the tribal man experiences w h e n he becomes literate. N e a r l y all the emotional and corporate f a m i l y feeling is eliminated f r o m his relationship w i t h his social g r o u p . H e is emotionally free t o separate f r o m the tribe and t o become a civilized individual, a man of visual organization w h o has u n i f o r m attitudes, habits, and rights w i t h all other civilized individuals. T h e Greek m y t h about the alphabet was that Cadmus, reputedly the k i n g w h o introduced the phonetic letters i n t o Greece, sowed the dragon's teeth, and t h e y sprang u p armed men. L i k e any other m y t h , this one capsulates a prolonged process i n t o a flashing insight. T h e alphabet meant p o w e r and a u t h o r i t y and c o n t r o l o f m i l i t a r y structures at a distance. W h e n combined w i t h papyrus, the alphabet spelled the end o f the stationary temple bureauc-

racies and the priestly monopolies of knowledge and p o w e r . U n l i k e pre-alphabetic w r i t i n g , w h i c h w i t h its innumerable signs was difficult t o master, the alphabet c o u l d be learned i n a f e w hours. T h e acquisition o f so extensive a knowledge and so complex a skill as pre-alphabetic w r i t i n g represented, w h e n applied to such u n w i e l d y materials as b r i c k and stone, insured f o r the scribal caste a m o n o p o l y of priestly power. T h e easier alphabet and the l i g h t , cheap, transportable papyrus together effected the transfer o f p o w e r f r o m the priestly t o the m i l i t a r y class. A l l this is implied i n the m y t h about Cadmus and the dragon's teeth, including the fall o f the c i t y states, the rise o f empires and m i l i t a r y bureaucracies. I n terms o f the extensions o f man, the theme of the dragon's teeth i n the Cadmus m y t h is o f the utmost importance. Elias Canetti i n Crowds and Power reminds us that the teeth are an obvious agent of p o w e r i n man, and especially i n many animals. Languages are filled w i t h testimony t o the grasping, devouring p o w e r and precision o f teeth. T h a t the p o w e r o f letters as agents o f aggressive order and precision should be expressed as extensions o f the dragon's teeth is natural and f i t t i n g . T e e t h are emphatically visual i n their lineal order. Letters are n o t o n l y like teeth visually, b u t their power t o p u t teeth i n t o the business o f empire-building is manifest i n our W e s t e r n history. T h e phonetic alphabet is a unique technology. T h e r e have been m a n y kinds o f w r i t i n g , pictographic and syllabic, b u t there is o n l y one phonetic alphabet i n w h i c h semantically meaningless letters are used to correspond to semantically meaningless sounds. T h i s stark divison and parallelism between a visual and an a u d i t o ry w o r l d was b o t h crude and ruthless, c u l t u r a l l y speaking. T h e phonetically w r i t t e n w o r d sacrifices w o r l d s o f meaning and perception that were secured b y forms like the hieroglyph and the Chinese ideogram. These c u l t u r a l ly richer forms o f w r i t i n g , h o w ever, offered men no means of sudden transfer f r o m the magically discontinuous and traditional w o r l d o f the t r i b a l w o r d i n t o the cool and u n i f o r m visual medium. M a n y centuries o f ideogrammic use have n o t threatened the seamless w e b o f f a m i l y and t r i b a l subtleties o f Chinese society. O n the other hand, a single genera-

t i o n o f alphabetic literacy suffices i n A f r i c a today, as i n G a u l t w o thousand years ago, t o release the individual initially, at least, f r o m the tribal w e b . T h i s fact has n o t h i n g t o do w i t h the content of the alphabetized w o r d s ; i t is the result o f the sudden breach between the a u d i t o r y and the visual experience of man. O n l y the phonetic alphabet makes such a sharp division i n experience, giving to its user an eye f o r an ear, and freeing h i m f r o m the t r i b a l trance of resonating w o r d magic and the w e b o f kinship. I t can be argued, then, that the phonetic alphabet, alone, is the technology that has been the means o f creating " c i v i l i z e d man"--the separate individuals equal before a w r i t t e n code o f law. Separateness of the individual, c o n t i n u i t y of space and o f time, and u n i f o r m i t y o f codes are the prime marks of literate and civilized societies. T r i b a l cultures like those o f the I n d i a n and the Chinese may be greatly superior t o the Western cultures, i n the range and delicacy o f their perceptions and expression. H o w e v e r , w e are not here concerned w i t h the question of values, b u t w i t h the configurations of societies. T r i b a l cultures cannot entertain the possibility o f the individual or o f the separate citizen. T h e i r ideas o f spaces and times are neither continuous n o r u n i f o r m , b u t compassional and compressional i n their intensity. I t is i n its p o w e r t o extend patterns of visual u n i f o r m i t y and c o n t i n u i t y that the "message" of the alphabet is f e l t b y cultures. As an intensification and extension o f the visual f u n c t i o n , the phonetic alphabet diminishes the role o f the other senses o f sound and t o u c h and taste i n any literate culture. T h e fact that this does n o t happen i n cultures such as the Chinese, w h i c h use nonphonetic scripts, enables them t o retain a r i c h store o f inclusive perception i n depth of experience that tends t o become eroded i n civilized c u l tures of the phonetic alphabet. F o r the ideogram is an inclusive gestalt, n o t an analytic dissociation o f senses and functions like phonetic w r i t i n g . T h e achievements of the W e s t e r n w o r l d , i t is obvious, are test i m o n y to the tremendous values o f literacy. B u t m a n y people are also disposed t o object that w e have purchased our structure o f specialist technology and values at t o o h i g h a price. Certainly the

lineal structuring o f rational life b y phonetic literacy has involved us i n an interlocking set o f consistencies that are striking enough t o j u s t i f y a m u c h more extensive i n q u i r y than that o f the present chapter. Perhaps there are better approaches along quite d i f ferent lines; f o r example, consciousness is regarded as the mark o f a rational being, y e t there is n o t h i ng lineal or sequential about the total field of awareness that exists i n any moment of consciousness. Consciousness is n o t a verbal process. Yet d u r i n g all our centuries o f phonetic literacy w e have favored the chain of inference as the m a r k o f logic and reason. Chinese w r i t i n g , i n contrast, invests each ideogram w i t h a total i n t u i t i o n of being and reason that allows o n l y a small role to visual sequence as a m a r k o f mental effort and organization. I n W e s t e r n literate society i t is still plausible and acceptable to say that something " f o l l o w s " f r o m something, as i f there were some cause at w o r k that makes such a sequence. I t was D a v i d H u m e w h o , i n the eighteenth century, demonstrated that there is no causality indicated i n any sequence, natural or logical. T h e sequential is merely additive, n o t causative. Hume's argument, said Immanuel K a n t , "awoke me f r o m m y dogmatic slumber." Neither H u m e nor Kant, however, detected the hidden cause o f our Western bias t o w a r d sequence as " l o g i c " i n the a l l pervasive technology o f the alphabet. T o d a y i n the electric age w e feel as free to invent nonlineal logics as w e do to make n o n Euclidean geometries. Even the assembly line, as the method o f analytic sequence f o r mechanizing every k i n d of making and p r o d u c t i o n , is nowadays y i e l d i n g to new forms. O n l y alphabetic cultures have ever mastered connected lineal sequences as pervasive forms o f psychic and social organization. T h e breaking up o f every k i n d of experience i n t o u n i f o r m units i n order t o produce faster action and change of f o r m (applied knowledge) has been the secret o f Western p o w er over man and nature alike. T h a t is the reason w h y our W e s t e r n industrial programs have quite i n v o l u n t a r i l y been so militant, and o u r m i l i t a r y programs have been so industrial. B o t h are shaped b y the alphabet i n their technique o f transformation and c o n t r o l b y m a k i n g all situations u n i f o r m and continuous. T h i s procedure,

manifest even i n the Graeco-Roman phase, became more intense w i t h the u n i f o r m i t y and repeatability o f the Gutenberg development. Civilization is b u i l t on literacy because literacy is a u n i f o r m processing o f a culture b y a visual sense extended i n space and time b y the alphabet. I n tribal cultures, experience is arranged b y a dominant a u d i t o r y sense-life that represses visual values. T h e auditory sense, unlike the cool and neutral eye, is hyper-esthetic and delicate and all-inclusive. O r a l cultures act and react at the same time. Phonetic culture endows men w i t h the means of repressing their feelings and emotions w h e n engaged i n action. T o act w i t h o u t reacting, w i t h o u t involvement, is the peculiar advantage o f Western literate man. T h e story o f The Ugly American describes the endless succession o f blunders achieved b y visual and civilized Americans w h e n confronted w i t h the tribal and a u d i t o r y cultures of the East. A s a civilized U N E S C O experiment, r u n n i n g w a t e r -- w i t h its lineal organization of pipes--was installed recently i n some Indian v i l lages. Soon the villagers requested that the pipes be removed, f o r i t seemed t o them that the w h o l e social life o f the village had been impoverished w h e n i t was no longer necessary f o r all t o visit the communal w e l l . T o us the pipe is a convenience. W e do n o t t h i n k o f i t as culture or as a p r o d u c t o f literacy, any more than w e t h i n k of literacy as changing our habits, our emotions, or our perceptions. T o nonliterate people, i t is perfectly obvious that the most commonplace conveniences represent total changes i n culture. T h e Russians, less permeated w i t h the patterns o f literate c u l ture than Americans, have m u c h less difficult y i n perceiving and accommodating the Asiatic attitudes. For the W e s t , literacy has l o n g been pipes and taps and streets and assembly lines and inventories. Perhaps most potent o f all as an expression o f literacy is our system of u n i f o r m p r i c i n g that penetrates distant markets and speeds the turn-ove r o f commodities. Even our ideas of cause and effect i n the literate W e s t have l o n g been i n the f o r m o f things i n sequence and succession, an idea that strikes any tribal or audit o r y culture as quite ridiculous, and one that has lost its prime place i n our o w n n e w physics and b i o l o g y .

A l l the alphabets i n use i n the W e s t e r n w o r l d , f r o m that o f Russia t o that of the Basques, f r o m that o f Portugal t o that o f Peru, are derivatives o f the Graeco-Roman letters. T h e i r unique separation o f sight and sound f r o m semantic and verbal content made them a most radical technology f o r the translation and homogenization o f cultures. A l l other forms o f w r i t i n g had served merely one culture, and had served t o separate that culture f r o m others. T h e phonetic letters alone could be used t o translate, albeit crudely, the sounds o f any language i n t o one-and-the-same visual code. T o d a y , the e f f o r t o f the Chinese t o use our phonetic letters t o translate their language has r u n i n t o special problems i n the w i d e tonal variations and meanings o f similar sounds. T h i s has led t o the practice o f fragmenting Chinese monosyllables i n t o polysyllables i n order t o eliminate tonal a m b i g u i t y. T h e W e s t e r n phonetic alphabet is n o w at w o r k transforming the central a u d i t o r y features o f the Chinese language and culture i n order that China can also develop the lineal and visual patterns that give central u n i t y and aggregate u n i f o r m power t o W e s t e r n w o r k and organization. A s w e move o u t o f the Gutenberg era o f our o w n culture, w e can more readily discern its p r i m a r y features of homogeneity, u n i f o r m i t y , and c o n t i n u i t y . These were the characteristics that gave the Greeks and Romans their easy ascendancy over the nonliterate barbarians. T h e barbarian or t r i b a l man, then as n o w , was hampered b y cultura l pluralism, uniqueness, and discontinuity. T o sum u p , pictographic and hieroglyphic w r i t i n g as used i n Babylonian, M a y a n , and Chinese cultures represents an extension o f the visual sense f o r storing and expediting access t o human experience. A l l o f these forms give pictoria l expression t o oral meanings. As such, they approximate the animated cartoon and are extremely u n w i e l d y , r e q u i r i n g many signs f o r the i n f i n i t y of data and operations o f social action. I n contrast, the phonetic alphabet, b y a f e w letters o n l y , was able t o encompass all languages. Such an achievement, however, involved the separation o f b o t h signs and sounds f r o m their semantic and dramatic meanings. N o other system o f w r i t i n g had accomplished this feat. T h e same separation o f sight and sound and meaning that is peculiar t o the phonetic alphabet also extends to its social and

psychological effects. Literate man undergoes m u c h separation of his imaginative, emotional, and sense life, as Rousseau (and later the Romantic poets and philosophers) proclaimed l o n g ago. T o d a y the mere mention of D . H . Lawrence w i l l serve t o recall the t w e n t i e t h - c e n t u ry efforts made t o by-pass literate man i n order t o recover human "wholeness." I f W e s t e r n literate man undergoes m u c h dissociation of inner sensibility f r o m his use of the alphabet, he also wins his personal freedom t o dissociate himself f r o m clan and f a m i l y . T h i s freedom t o shape an individual career manifested itself i n the ancient w o r l d i n m i l i t a r y life. Careers were open t o talents i n Republican Rome, as m u c h as i n Napoleonic France, and f o r the same reasons. T h e new literacy had created an homogeneous and malleable milieu i n w h i c h the m o b i l i t y o f armed groups and o f ambitious individuals, equally, was as novel as i t was practical.
