Abstract and Keywords
This chapter presents a good introduction to Roger Chartier's, The Cultural Uses of Print in Early Modern France. Fernando de Rojas' prologue clearly indicates the central tension of every history of reading--and this is why he is worthy of consideration. Reading is a creative practice, which invents singular meanings and significations that are not reducible to the intentions of authors of texts or producers of books. Rojas also implies that the history of genres, both textual and typographical, could provide the underpinnings for the history of discourse as formulated by Michel Foucault. Printing lowers the cost of the book's manufacture and shortens the time of production. Cultural history might find a new niche at the crossroads of textual criticism, the history of the book, and cultural sociology.

In the prologue to his Celestina, published in Saragossa in 1507, Fernando de Rojas asked himself why the work had been understood, appreciated, and used in so many different ways since its first appearance in 1499 at Burgos.1 The question is simple: how can a text that is the same for everyone who reads it become an "instrument of discord and battle between its readers, creating divergences between them, with each reader having an opinion depending on his own taste?" (instrumento de lid o contienda a sus lectores para ponerlos en diferencias, dando cada una sentencia sabre ella a sabor de su voluntad?) I will use this question, formulated by a classical author about an old text, as my point of departure in delineating basic hypotheses

for a history of practices of reading. These practices will be defined to include relationships to printed objects (which are by no means limited to books) and to the texts that readers thus encounter. For Rojas, the contrasting receptions of the text he presented to the public are due first to the readers themselves, whose (p.155) contradictory judgments can be traced not only to their diversity of characters and dispositions ("tantas y tan differentes condiciones") but also to their multiplicity of abilities and expectations. Abilities and expectations are differentiated according to age: niños, mozos, mancebos, viejos (little children, schoolboys, young fellows, old men) do not approach writing in the same way; some do not know how to read, while others have no desire to or no longer can. Abilities and expectations are also differentiated according to the highly distinct uses readers make of the same text. Rojas notes at least three readings of the tragicomedia. The first focuses not on the story as a whole but rather on certain detached episodes. It reduces the text to the status of a cuentode camino (travelers' tale), to a story told for passing time, much like the one that Sancho tells his master in part One, chapter 20, of Don Quixote. The second reading retains from the tragicomedy nothing more than easily memorized formulas, those donaires y refranes (pleasantries and proverbs) that provide cliches and ready-made expressions. These formulas are collected in the course of a reading that establishes absolutely no intimate relationship, no individual rapport, between the reader and what is read. To these practices, which mutilate the work and miss its true meaning, the author opposes the correct, profitable reading. This third reading is the one that grasps the text in its complex totality without reducing it to mere episodes of a plot or a collection of impersonal maxims. Those who read the comedia properly "will understand its essential matter and profit from it, they will be amused at its wit, and they will store away in their memories the maxims and sayings of the philosophers, in order, when the proper time comes, to use them to advantage" (coligen la surna para su provecho, ríen 10 donoso, las sentencias y diehos de filósofos guardan en su memoria para trasponer en lugares convenibles a sus aetasy propósitos). They thus put into operation a plural reading that distinguishes the comic from the serious, and that extracts the moral that best illuminates each person's life, whose "first person" is applicable to everyone. In its way, Rojas's prologue clearly indicates the central tension of every history of reading--and this is why he is worthy (p.156) of our consideration.

Should we place at the center of such a history the text given to be read or the reader who takes it up? The reader is, in effect, always thought by the author (or the commentator) to be necessarily subjugated to a single meaning, to a correct interpretation, to an authorized reading. To understand reading, in this view, would be above all to identify the discursive arrangements that constrain it and that impose on it a signification that is intrinsic and independent of any deciphering. But in thus postulating the absolute efficacy of the text tyrannically to dictate the meaning of the work to the reader, do we not in fact deny all autonomy in the act of reading? The latter is virtually absorbed and annihilated in both the explicit protocols and the implicit devices that are intended to regulate or control it. In this manner, reading is thought of as inscribed in the text, all effect automatically produced by the very strategy of writing peculiar to the work or its genre. Nevertheless, experience shows that reading is not simply submission to textual machinery. Whatever it may be, reading is a creative practice, which invents singular meanings and significations that are not reducible to the intentions of authors of texts or producers of books. Reading is a response, a labor, or, as Michel de Certeau puts it, an act of "poaching" (braconnage).2 But how do we make sense of this living, personal, striking experience? If each reading by each reader is actually a secret, singular creation, is it still possible to organize this indistinguishable plurality of individual acts according to shared regularities? Is it even possible to envision knowing anything certain about it? How can we consider at one and the same time the irreducible freedom of readers and the constraints meant to curb this freedom? This fundamental tension runs through literary criticism, which is torn between two fundamentally different approaches. On the one hand there are the approaches that deduce the reading or the reader from the text's own internal structures; on the other there are approaches--such as the phenomenology of the act of reading or "reception aesthetics"--that attempt to (p.157) locate individual or shared determinations which govern modes of interpretation from outside of the text.3 Tile tension is also central in philosophical endeavors that, like the work of Ricoeur, consider how the narrative configurations that form stories (of fiction or history) remodel the private consciousness and the temporal experience of subjects. In such a perspective, the act of reading is strategically situated at the point of "application" (Anwendurzg, in the hermeneutic lexicon) where the world of the text meets that of the reader, where the interpretation of the work ends in the interpretation of the self. Reading is to be understood as an

"appropriation" of the text, both because it actualizes the text's semantic potential and because it creates a mediation for knowledge of the self through comprehension of the text.4 In what way can a historical perspective help to resolve the contradictions in literary theory or the difficulties of phenomenological philosophy, which while defining reading as a concrete act does not consider pertinent the multiple variations that at different times and places organize its contrasting forms? History offers two approaches that are necessarily linked: reconstructing the diversity of older readings from their sparse and multiple traces, and recognizing the strategies by which authors and publishers tried to impose an orthodoxy or a prescribed reading on the text. Among these strategies, some are explicit and rely on discourse (ill prefaces, prologues, commentaries, notes), and others implicit, making of the text a machinery that by necessity must impose a comprehension held to be legitimate. Guided or trapped, the reader invariably finds himself inscribed in the text, but in turn the text is itself inscribed variously in its different readers. Thus it is necessary to bring together two perspectives that are often disjointed: on the one hand, the study of the way in which texts and the printed works that convey them organize the prescribed reading; (p.158) and on the other, the collection of actual readings tracked down in individual confessions or reconstructed on the level of communities of readers--those "interpretive communities" whose members share the same reading styles and the same strategies of interpretation.5 Let us return to our Spanish master. For. Rojas. the diverse opinions on the Celestina are to be linked first to the many differences in abilities, expectations, and predispositions of its readers. But the opinions also depend on how the readers "read" the text. It is clear that Rojas addresses a reader who reads the prologue to himself, in silence, in private. Yet not all readings of the tragicomedy are of this nature: "So then, when ten persons congregate to hear this play there will naturally be a variety of reactions among them. Who will deny that there will arise dissension about something which may be understood in so many different ways?" (Así que cuando diez personas se juntaren a oír esta comedia, en quien quepa esta diferencia de condiciones, come suele acaecer, ¿quién negará que haya contienda en cosa que de tantas maneras se entienda?). Ten listeners gathered around a text read out loud: here "reading" is actually listening to speech that is read. The practice was common, for in the edition of 1500 the "corrector de la irnpresian" tells how the text should be read aloud. One of the stanzas that he adds to the work is entitled "On the way to read this

tragicomedy" (Dice el modo que se ha de tener leyendo esta tragicomedia). The "lector" he envisions must know how to vary the tone, play the parts of all the characters, convey asides by speaking through his teeth--in short, mobilize "a thousand arts and methods" (mil artes y modos) of reading in order to capture the attention of "los oyentes," the listeners. Along with the Celestina, other texts such as pastorals or chivalric romances are the favored texts of these readings, where, for a few people, the spoken word offers a written text even to those who could read it themselves. Rojas's notation opens several paths of inquiry. The first concerns the sociability of reading, a fundamental counterpoint to the privatization of the act of reading, to its retreat into the intimacy (p.159) of solitude. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, reading out loud survived in the tavern and the coach, the salon and the café, in high society and in the household. This history remains to be written.6. A second path leads to the analysis of the relationship between textuality and orality. To be sure, between the culture of the tale and of storytelling on the one hand and that of writing on the other the differences are great, and aptly characterized by Cervantes in the passage from Don Quixote cited above.7 To pass the time while standing gllard one night, Sancho undertakes to tell stories to his master. But his method--interrupting the account with commentaries and digressions that result in repetition upon repetition and that project the narrator into the story and relate the story back to the present situationmakes his listener wildly impatient: "If thou tellest thy tale in this manner, cried Don Quixote, repeating every circumstance twice over, it will not be finished these two days; proceed therefore, connectedly, and rehearse it, like a man of understanding: otherwise, thou hadst better hold thy tongue" (Si desa manera cuentas tu cuento, Sancho--dijo don Quijote--, repitiendo dos veces lo que vas diciendo, no acabarás ell dos días; dilo seguidamente, y cuéntalo como hombre de entendimiento, y si no, no digas nada.) A man of books par excellence, even to crazy excess, Don Quixote becomes irritated by a story that lacks the form of those he ordinarily reads; Quixote really wants Sancho's recitation to conform to the rules of linear, objective, hierarchical writing. The distance between these expectations of a reader and the oral practice as Sancho learned it is insurmountable: "In my country, answered Sancho, all the old stories are told in this manner, neither can I tell it in any other; nor is it civil in your worship, to desire I should change the custom" (De la misma manera que yo lo cuento--respondi6 Sancho--se cuentan en mi tierra todas las consejas, (p.160) y yo no sé contarlo de otra, ni es bien que vuestra merced me pide que haga usos nuevos). Resigned, Don Quixote reluctantly agrees to listen to this text that is so different from

those contained in his precious books: "Take thy own way, said the Knight, and since it is the will of fate, that I should hear thee, pray go on" (Di como quisieres--respondió don Quijote--; que pues la suerte quiere que no pueda dejar de escucharte, prosigue). The discrepancy, then, between the spoken recitation and the printed script is great. We must bear in mind, however, that the links between the two are numerous. For one thing, formulas of oral culture are often inscribed in texts destined for a large public. Occasionnels (ephemera, yet having perhaps a longer life than the English term implies) that use in written form the storytellers' methods of recitation or the variations introduced in the popular editions. of fairy tales by borrowing from folkloric traditions are good examples of these joinings of the spoken with the printed word.8 Moreover, this continuing dependence assures the return of multiple texts into oral forms, where they are destined to be read aloud: for example, in monastic. exercises or preaching, in reading for pleasure or family teaching. But for Rojas there is another reason that could confound the understanding of the text he offered to his readers: the unfortunate intervention of the printers themselves. He in effect deplores the additions they felt they could make, against his will and against the recommendations of the ancients: "The very printers have wounded the text: they have put unnecessary headings and summaries at the beginning of the acts, which was a custom not followed by ancient authors" (Que aun los impresores han dado sus pinturas, poniendo rubricas a sumarios al principia de cada acto, narrando en breve lo que dentro contenia: una cosa bien escusada, segun lo que los antiguos escritores usaron). This observation can establish a fundamental distinction between the text and print, between the work of writing and that of making the book. As an American bibliographer justly observed, "Whatever they may do, authors do not write books. Books are not written at all. They are manufactured by scribes and other artisans, by mechanics and other engineers, and by printing presses and other machines."9 In contrast to the representation of the ideal, abstract text--which is stable because it is detached from all materiality, a representation elaborated by literature itself--it is essential to remember that no text exists outside of the support that enables it to be read; any comprehension of a writing, no matter what kind it is, depends on the forms in which it reaches its reader. Thus a sorting out of two types of apparatus becomes necessary, between those entailed by the putting into text, the strategies of writing, the intentions of the "author," and those

resulting from the manufacture of the book or publication, produced by editorial decision or through workshop procedures, which are aimed at readers or readings that may not be at all like those the author intended, This gap, which is the space in which meaning is constructed, has too often been overlooked, not only by the classical approaches, which consider the work itself as a pure text whose typographical forms do not matter, but also by reception theory (Rezeptionstheorie), which postulates a direct, immediate relationship between the "text" and the reader, between the "textual signals" used by the author and the "horizon of expectation" of those he addresses. Here, it seems to me, we find an illegitimate simplification of the process by which works take on meaning. Restoration of its true complexity requires consideration of the close-knit relationship among three poles: the text itself, the object that conveys the text, and the act that grasps it. Variations in this triangular relationship produce in effect changes in meaning, which can be organized in a few models. First, there is the case of a stable text presented for reading in printed forms that themselves change. In studying the variations in the printing of (p.162) William Congreve's plays in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, D. F. MacKenzie was able to show how apparently small and limited typographical transformations (the shift from a format of quarto to octavo, the use of an ornament to separate scenes, the numbering of episodes with roman numerals, the list of characters' names at the beginning of each scene, the mention of who enters and who exits, the indication of the speaker's name) had major effects on the status given to the work, on how it was read, even on the way the author himself considered it. A new readability was created by the format, which made the book easier to carry, and by the layout, which restored something of the dramatic sense of movement and of time in print. A new readability, but also a new horizon of reception, for the forms used in the 1710 octavo edition had seemingly "classicized" the text--which might be what led Congreve to purify the writing here and there, in order to make it conform to the text's new legitimacy.10 In the same way, it seems to me that the editorial history of Moliere's comedies has a significant impact on the reconstruction of contemporary understandings of them. With George Dundin, for example, four changes must be taken into account. First, there was a shift from separate editions of the play in the form of small books that were closely linked with performances, to its publication as part of edited series, individually or in continuous pagination, whereby the play was inscribed in a corpus and its

meaning contaminated by its proximity to other comedies. Second, as print became theatricalized, beginning with the 1682 edition the number of stage directions, particularly the cues, progressively multiplied, thus allowing Molière's sense of the scene to be preserved in readings detached from the immediacy of the performance. Third, the introduction of illustrations, also in 1682, required a series of choices to be made (which scene to illustrate, how to represent characters and interpret stage directions) and constituted a protocol of reading (p.163) for the text that it accompanied. And fourth, after 1734 a single edition appeared, containing the comedy itself, the text of the pastoral in which the comedy had been inserted, and the account of the 1668 festival at Versailles where both had been included during the first performance--as if at the beginning of tile eighteenth century the play, now situated at a historical distance, was supposed to be restored to the context of its creation. Thus tile text, unchanged since the first editions in 1669, now changes because the apparatus ill which it is to be read has changed.11 The second model concerns the way in which changes in the printed form of a text govern the transformations in its meaning. This is the case, for example, with the titles in tile corpus of French chapbooks (the "Bibliothèque bleue"), an editorial formula aimed at winning over the most numerous (and most popular) readership between 1700 and the mid 1800s. The common characteristics of these editions are above all material and commercial. The material side of publication involved paperbound books, covered generally with blue paper (but also red or marbled), printed with type that was old and mismatched, illustrated with second-hand woodcuts, and with a picture frequently taking the place of the publisher's insignia on the title page. Commercially, even if the length of the works varied, their prices always remained low, much lower than those books that were produced for a more refined and thus more expensive market. Thus, the Bibliothèque bleue required that costs be calculated quite precisely so that a book could be sold at the lowest possible price. The texts of the Bibliothèque bleue were not written for such editorial ends. The politics of the inventors of the formula (the printers of Troyes, later copied in Rouen, Caen. Limoges, and Avignon) consisted of picking out from a repertoire of already published texts those works that seemed to them to meet the expectations and abilities of the vast public they hoped to attract. From this formula, two essential corollaries followed: the texts published as chapbooks were not "popular" in and of (p.164) themselves but came from all genres, from all eras, and from all kinds of literature, and all had already enjoyed a relatively long editorial life in classic published

form before becoming a part of the Bibliothèque bleue. Thus devotional literature and religious exercises, fairy tales and novels, and handbooks all were included. Between publication of the original text and manufacture of the chapbook edition, the gap could be great and was always marked by a series of editions with nothing "popular" about them. The cultural specificity of the materials published in the Bibliothèque bleue, then, stemmed not from the erudite and diverse texts themselves but from editorial intervention intended to make them conform to the reading ability of the buyers whom the publishers wanted to attract. This work of adaptation modified the text as it was given in the previous edition, which in turn served as copy for the printers of "popular" books. The adaptation was informed by the image the printers had of the competence and cultural expectations of readers who were unfamiliar with books. The printers undertook three kinds of transformations of the text: they shortened the texts, removed chapters, episodes, or digressions deemed superfluous, and simplified the wording by stripping sentences of their relative and incidental clauses; they broke up the text by creating new chapters and adding paragraphs, titles, and summaries: and they censored allusions deemed to be blasphemous or sacrilegious, descriptions considered licentious, and scatological or indecent expressions. The logic behind this adaptive work was thus twofold: it aimed to control the texts by submitting them to the demands of Counter-Reform religion and morals, while at the same time intending to make them more accessible to inexperienced readers. The implicit reading that such a work sought to create can be characterized as a reading that required visible landmarks (hence anticipatory titles and summary recapitulations, or even woodcuts functioning as protocols of reading or mnemonic devices). This kind of reading was comfortable only with brief, self-contained, often disjointed sequences and apparently was satisfied with minimal global coherence. This manner of reading (p.165) was not at all that of the literate elites, who were familiar with books and adept at deciphering and mastering texts in their entirety. Unlike the scholar, the rudimentary reader could tolerate the dross left in the text by hasty and cheap manufacturing processes (for example, the countless misprints, cuts in the wrong places, confusions of names and words, multiple errors). Chapbook readers (or at least the majority of them, for notables too bought the books for pleasure, curiosity, or collecting) read in what seems to have been a discontinuous, fragmented way that accommodated gaps and incoherences.

The rudimentary reader was also comfortable with books that included texts he already knew, at least partially or approximately. Often read out loud-- but not only (or perhaps not at all) during those evenings devoted to public readings called veillées--the chapbooks could be memorized by listeners who, when actually faced with the books, recognized them more than they discovered them. And more generally, even outside of this direct listening, most people read books with a previously gained knowledge that was easily evoked in the act of reading. This knowledge was gained from the recurrence of coded forms, from the repetition of themes, and from the books' images (even if these originally had no relation to the text they illustrated). This "preknowledge," as it were, was mobilized to produce comprehension of what was read--a comprehension not necessarily in conformity with that desired by the producer of the text or the maker of the book, or with that which a sharp and well-informed reading could construct. "Popular" reading can thus be traced to these particularities, both formal and typographic (taking the latter in the largest sense of the term, as found, for example, in MacKenzie), of the publication of the chapbooks and to the modifications they imposed on the texts on which they were based. In this context, then, popular reading is understood as a relation to the text unlike that of literate culture. A third model of this relationship among text, book, and understanding appears when a text that is stable in content and fixed in form becomes the object of contrasting readings. "A book is changed by the fact that it does not change even when (p.166) the world changes," declared Pierre Bourdieu.12 To make the proposition compatible with the smaller scale of this essay, let us add: "even when its mode of reading changes." We need to develop indicators of the major divisions that can organize a history of reading practices (of the use of texts, even the uses of the same text)--for example between reading out loud, for oneself or for others, and reading in silence; between reading inwardly and privately and reading publicly; between religious reading and lay reading; and between "intensive" reading and "extensive" reading (to borrow the terminology of R. Engelsing).13 eyond these macroscopic cleavages, the historian must seek to determine the dominant paradigms of reading in a community of readers in a given time and place. These include, for example, the Puritan readings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries or the "Rousseauist" reading of the Enlightenment or, yet again, the "agical" reading of traditional peasant societies. Each of these "manners of reading" has its own specific gestures, its proper uses of the book, and its particular referential text (the Bible, the Nouvelle Héloise, the Grand and Petit Albert). The mode of reading, which is

dictated by the book itself or by its interpreters, provides the archetype of all reading, whatever kind it may be.14 Characterization of these modes of reading is therefore indispensable to any approach that aims to. reconstruct how texts could be apprehended, understood, and handled. The final remarks of Rojas in the prologue of the Celestina concern the very genre of the text: "Others have made quite a to-do about the name of the play, saying it was not a comedy (p.167) but a tragedy, since it ended so sadly. The first author wished to give it a description that would reflect what happens in the beginning, and so he called it a comedy. I have found myself in a dilemma, and I have cut the Gordian knot by calling the playa tragicomedy" (Otros han litigado sobre el nombre, diciendo que no se había de llamar comedia, pues acababa en tristeza, sino que se llamase tragedia. E1 primer auctor quiso dar denominación del principio, que fue placer, y llamóla comedia. Yo, viendo estas discordias, entre estos estremos partí agora por medio la porfía, y llarnéla tragicomedia). The notation leads to two series of reflections. First and foremost, it reminds us that the explicit indicators by which texts are designated and classified create expectations of the reading and anticipations of understanding. That is the case as well for the indication of the genre, which links the text to be read to other texts that have already been read and which signals to the reader the appropriate "preknowledge" in which to locate the text. A similar process takes place with purely formal or material indicators-- the format and the image, for example. From the folio to smaller formats, a hierarchy exists that links the format of the book, the genre of the text, and the moment and mode of reading. In the eighteenth century Lord Chesterfield bore witness to this fact: "Solid folios are the people of business with whom I converse in the morning. Quartos are the easier mixed company with whom I sit after dinner; and I pass my evenings ill the light, and often frivolous chitchat of small octavos and duodecimos."15 Such a hierarchy is, moreover, directly inherited from the days when books were copied by hand. This hierarchy distinguished the book that had to be laid flat in order to be read; the humanist book, which was more manageable in its medium format and suitable for both classic and newer texts; and the portable book, the libellus, a pocketbook and bedside book with multiple uses and more numerous readers.16 The image (p.168) on the frontispiece or title page, along the border of the text, or on the last page also classified the text and suggested a reading. It provided the protocol of the reading, the identifying index.

Rojas also leads us to think that the history of genres, both textual and, typographical, could provide the underpinnings for the history of discourse as formulated by Foucault.17 Understanding the series of discourses in their discontinuity, stripping principles of their regularity, and identifying their particular rationalities all presuppose, I believe, that the constraints and demands of the very forms in which they are to be read be taken into account. Hence we must pay attention to the laws of production and to the obligatory devices governing every class or series of texts that have become books--the lives of saints as well as the books of hours, the occasionnels and Bibliothèque bleue, the folhetos de cordel and chapbooks, the emblem books and programs of civic processions, and so on. Hence, moreover, we must trace the shifts from one genre to another, when a given form becomes invested with issues that are normally foreign to it or with themes that are generally expressed elsewhere and in other ways. In the seventeenth century, for example, at the time of the acute crisis known as the Fronde, the "general politicization of printing" placed all textual and typographic genres of large circulation and public reading (from the letter to the gazette, from the song to the narrative account) at the disposal of the conflicting parties.18 The critical and genealogical study of discourses in series can thus find support in a project that takes each text or collection of texts and considers the intersections between the history of the variations in their content and the history of the transformations they undergo when being put into print. These working hypotheses are backed by several critical reevaluations that call into question the certainties and habits of French cultural history. The first concerns the classic uses of the (p.169) notion of popular culture. This notion no longer appears to hold up against three fundamental doubts. First and foremost, it 110 longer seems tenable to try to establish strict correspondences between cultural cleavages and social hierarchies, creating simplistic relationships between particular cultural objects or forms and specific social groups. On the contrary, it is necessary to recognize the fluid circulation and shared practices that cross social boundaries. Numerous examples exist of the "popular" uses of objects, ideas, and codes that were not considered as such (think of the readings of Menocchio, the Friulian miller):19 conversely, the rejection by the dominant culture of forms rooted ill the common culture came late. Second, it does not seem possible to identify the absolute difference and the radical specificity of popular culture on the basis of its own texts, beliefs, or codes. The materials that convey the practices and thoughts of ordinary people are always mixed, blending forms and themes, invention and tradition, literate culture and folklore.

Finally, the macroscopic opposition between "popular" and "high" culture has lost its pertinence. An inventory of the multiple divisions that fragment the social body is preferable to this massive partition, which often defines the common people by default as the collection of those outside elite society. Their ordering follows several principles that make manifest the divergences or oppositions between men and women, townspeople and rural folk, Protestants and Catholics, but also between generations, occupations, and neighborhoods. For far too long, French sociocultural history has accepted a reductive definition of the social, identified only with the hierarchy of wealth and its conditions. This approach has lost sight of the fact that other differences, based on gender as well as on territorial or religious affiliations, were also clearly social. Such differences could make sense of the plurality of cultural practices, proving at least as and perhaps more effective than the opposition of dominant/dominated or the socioprofessional hierarchy. (p.170) Thus, because it ignores borrowings and exchanges, because it masks the multiplicity of differences, because it presupposes a priori the validity of a set of divisions that remains to be established, the concept of popular culture--which provided the foundation for the first pioneering studies about chapbooks--must now be called into question. We must likewise question the long-recognized contrast between the completely oral and gestural forms of so-called traditional cultures on the one hand and the circulation of writing, first in manuscript and then in printed form, on the other, a contrast that delimits a separate, minority culture. The division has encouraged the partitioning of the approaches to these two modes of cultural acquisition and transmission; it has rigidly separated historical anthropology (which, even if it works with texts, is attached to systems of gestures, to the use of words, and to ritual apparatuses) from a more classic cultural history dedicated to studying the production and circulation of writing. Thus formulated, the opposition of oral and written fails to account for the situation that existed from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century when media and multiple practices still overlapped. Some of these overlaps associate the spoken word and writing: either a spoken word fixes itself in writing or, conversely, a text returns in oral form through the mediation of reading out loud. Other overlaps connect writings and gestures. Numerous texts overtly aim to negate their own status as discourse in order to produce, at the practical level, behavior or practices held to be legitimate or useful. Manuals on how to prepare for death, books on religious exercises, guides to good manners, and handbooks

are among many examples of genres that attempt to internalize necessary or appropriate gestures. Furthermore, writing is installed at the very heart of the most central forms of traditional culture; festivals or entries, for instance, are surrounded by written notices of all kinds and commented on in programs that explain their meaning, and ecclesiastical rituals often require written objects to be placed at the center of the ceremony. The history of cultural practices must consider these interpenetrations and restore some of the complex trajectories that run from the spoken word to the written text, from (p.171) writing that is read to gestures that are performed, from the printed book to reading aloud. One concept seems useful here, that of appropriation: because, understood more sociologically than phenomenologically, the notion of appropriation makes it possible to appreciate the differences in cultural apportionment, in the creative invention that lies at the very heart of the reception process. A retrospective sociology that has long made the unequal distribution of objects the primary criterion of the cultural hierarchy must be replaced by a different approach that focuses attention on differentiated and contrasting uses of the same goods, the same texts, and the same ideas. Such a perspective does not preclude identifying differences (including socially rooted differences), but it displaces the very arena of their identification because it no longer involves social qualification of tile works as a whole (for example, designation of Bibliothèque bleue texts as "popular literature"). Instead, it characterizes the practices that differentially appropriate the materials circulating in a given society. The statistical approach that once seemed to dominate French cultural history and that sought to weigh the unequal social distribution of serializable objects, discourses, and acts therefore no longer suffices. By presuming overly simplistic correspondences between social levels and cultural boundaries and seizing upon the most repetitive and reductionist expressions of ideas and behaviors, such a course misses the essential, that is, the contrasting manner in which groups or individuals utilize shared themes or forms. Without abandoning the measures and the series, the history of texts and of books must be above all a reconstitution of variations in practices--in other words, a history of reading. Thought of in this way, the emphasis on cultural appropriations also enables us to see that texts or words intended to mold thoughts and actions are never wholly effective and radically acculturating. The practices of appropriation always create uses or representations that are hardly reducible

to the wills or intentions of those who produce discourse and norms. During the Catholic reform, for instance, the imposition of new devotions was accompanied by recastings and reinterpretations (p.172) that profoundly transformed them. The devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, which was central in post-Tridentine pastoral work and iconography, was strongly contaminated by the ancient cult of relics and subverted by a demand for exteriorization that insisted on public and spectacular practices (the exposition of the sacrament, the benediction, and the procession) no longer easily accepted by ecclesiastical authority. And the devotion to the Rosary often reasserted the gestures and meanings traditionally attached to the cult of the Virgin of Mercy.20 Between the institution and the community, between the normative model and the collective experience, the game was always two way. So-called popular religion was at once acculturated and acculturating: neither totally controlled nor absolutely free, it affirmed the specific modes of belief at the very core of the acceptance of new models of spirituality. By the same token, the act of reading cannot be effaced in the text itself, nor can significations be annihilated in imposed meanings. The acceptance of messages and models always operates through adjustments, arrangements, or resistances. That is the lesson of Richard Hoggart's book The Uses of Literacy.21 In 1950S England, the culture of the popular classes, far from being reduced to that embodied in the productions of mass culture, was characterized by a relationship of defiance and defensiveness vis-á-vis the messages it received and consumed. Large-circulation newspapers, tabloids, advertisements, horoscopes, and songs are always the object of an oblique or distracted attention that reads or understands them with pleasure and suspicion, at once fascinated and distanced. Belief and disbelief go together, and the acceptance of the truth in what one reads or hears does not diminish the fundamental doubts retained about this presumed authenticity. Does Haggart in fact provide a key for understanding the particularity of the relationship between the least literate public and the texts that aim to govern and distract them, from the Bibliothèque bleue to the (p.173) soap opera? Or is it better to place this characterization within the longue durée of differential modes of belief that can ascertain similar ambivalences at completely other social levels in other historical situations?22 At any rate, Hoggart's work reminds us of the reader's creative autonomy in the face of the machineries that try to control him. Here, the idea of appropriation is not taken in the sense defined by Foucauit in Discourse on Language. Foucault considered the "social appropriation

of discourses" as a procedure that controls them and an apparatus that limits their distribution--in other words, as one of the grand systems of the subjugation of discourse.23 My perspective is different without being contradictory, because it focuses attention not on exclusions by confiscation but on the differences within shared usage, such as those indicated by Pierre Bourdieu: "The taste, propensity and aptitude for appropriation (material and/or symbolic) of a specific class of objects or of classified or classifying practices, is the generating formula behind style of life. It is a unitary ensemble of distinctive preferences which express the same intention in the specific logic of each one of the symbolic subspaces."24 Which is to say that contrasting practices must be understood as competitions, that their differences are organized by strategies of distinction or imitation, and that the diverse uses of the same cultural goods are rooted in the stable predispositions proper to each group. Consequently, we have a choice between two models for making sense of texts, books, and their readers. The first contrasts discipline and invention, presenting these categories not as antagonistic but as an interrelated pair. Every textual or typographic arrangement that aims to create control and constraint always secretes tactics that tame or subvert it; conversely, there is no production or cultural practice that does not rely on materials imposed by tradition, authority, or the market and (p.174) that is not subjected to surveillance and censures from those who have power over words or gestures. Thus, a presumed "popular" spontaneity cannot be simply opposed to the coercions imposed by the authorities; what must be recognized is how liberties that are always restrained (by conventions, codes, constraints) and disciplines that are always upset articulate with each other. Discipline and invention must be considered, but so must distinction and divulgation. This second pair of interdependent ideas enables us to posit an understanding of the circulation of objects and cultural models that is not reductive to a simple process of diffusion, one generally thought to descend along the social ladder. The processes of imitation or vulgarization are more complex and more dynamic and must be considered, above all, as struggles of competition. In these struggles every divulgation, conceded or won, produces simultaneously the search for a new distinction. Thus, once the book became a more common object and less distinctive by its being merely possessed, the manners of reading took over the task of showing variations, of making manifest differences in the social hierarchy. Simplistic, rigid representations of social domination or cultural diffusion must thus be replaced. Following Elias and Bourdieu, we can develop a means of

understanding that recognizes the reproduction of distances at the very interior of the mechanisms of imitation, competition in the midst of sharing, and the constitution of new distinctions in the very processes of disclosure.25 These hypotheses and ideas enable us to attempt the study of print practices in former societies. These practices are a good entry point into European culture of the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries for two reasons. First, they fix or convey speech, which means that they cement sociabilities and prescribe behavior, cross into both private and public space, and give rise to belief, imagination, and action. They overturn the whole culture, coming to terms with traditional forms of communication (p.175) and establishing new distinctions. Second, they permit the circulation of writing on an unprecedented scale. Printing lowers the cost of the book's manufacture because the cost is distributed among all the copies of an edition rather than being supported by a single copy. In addition, printing shortens the time of production, which was very long for books in manuscript. After Gutenberg, the entire culture of the West could be considered a culture of print, because the products of presses and typographical composition, rather than being reserved for administrative and ecclesiastical uses as in China or Korea, themselves influenced all relations and practices. We are left with a twofold ambition and a twofold task. On a small scale, we must understand the multiple, differentiated, contradictory uses of print, because competing authorities had faith in its powers and readers handled it according to their abilities or their expectations.26 From a larger perspective, we must reinscribe the emergence of the printing press in the long-term history of the forms of the book or the supports of texts (from the volumen to the codex, from the book to the screen) and in the history of reading practices. Here, cultural history might find a new niche at the crossroads of textual criticism, the history of the book, and cultural sociology.

Preface

In bringing together under this title the three essays that make up this book I hope to highlight a question that runs all through it: how did people in Western Europe between the end of the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century attempt to master the enormously increased number of texts that first the manuscript book and then print put into circulation? Inventorying titles, categorizing works, and attributing texts were all operations that made it possible to set the world of the written word in order. Our own age is the direct heir of this immense effort motivated by anxiety. It was in those decisive centuries, when the hand-copied book was gradually replaced by works composed in movable type and printed on presses, that the acts and thoughts that are still our own were forged. The invention of the author as the fundamental principle for the designation of a text, the dream of a universal library, real or imaginary, containing all the works that have ever been wirtten, and the ernergence of a new definition of the book that made an indissoluble connection between an object, a text, and an author these are some of the innovations that transformed

Preface
people's relationship with texts, both before and after Gutenberg. That relationship typically contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, every reader has to deal with an entire set of constraints and obligations. The author, the bookseller-publisher, the commentator, and the censor all have an interest in keeping close control over the production of meaning and in making sure that the text that they have written, published, glossed, or authorized will be understood with no possible deviation from their prescriptive will. On the other hand, reading, by definition, is rebellious and vagabond. Readers use infinite numbers of subterfuges to procure prohibited books, to read between the lines, and to subvert the lessons imposed on them. The hook always aims at installing an order, whether it is the order in which it is deciphered, the order in which it is to be understood, or the order intended by the authority who commanded or permitted the work. This multifaceted order is not all-powerful, however, when it comes to annulling the reader's liberty. Even when it is hemmed in by differences in competence and by conventions, liberty knows how to distort and reformulate the significations that were supposed to defeat it. The dialectic between imposition and appropriation, between constraints transgressed and freedoms bridled, is not the same in all places or all times or for all people. Recognizing its diverse modalities and multiple variations is the first aim of a history of reading that strives to grasp - in all their differences communities of readers and their 'arts of reading'. The order of books has still another meaning. Whether they are in manuscript or in print, books are objects whose forms, if they cannot impose the sense of the texts that they bear, at least command the uses that can invest them

and the approprtattons to which they are susceptible. Works and discourses exist only when they become physical realities and are inscribed on the pages of a book, transmitted by a voice reading or narrating, or spoken on the stage of a theatre. Understanding the principles that govern the 'order of discourse' supposes that the principles underlying the processes of production, communication, and reception of books (and other objects that bear writing) will also be deciphered in a rigorous manner. More than even before, historians of literary works and historians of cultural practices have become aware of the effects of meaning that material forms produce. In the case of the book, those forms constitute a singular order totally distinct from other registers of transmission of the canonical works as ordinary texts. This means that, even though it is not emphasized in the present book, keen attention should be paid to the technical, visual, and physical devices that organize the reading of writing when writing becomes a book. This work has another aim in its three chapters: to initiate more general reflection on the reciprocal relations between the two meanings that we spontaneously give to the term 'culture'. The first designates the works and the acts that lend themselves to aesthetic or intellectual appreciation in any given society; the second aims at ordinary, banal practices that express the way in which a community - on any scale - experiences and conceives of its relationship with the world, with others, and with itself. Works - even the greatest works, especially the greatest works - have no stable, universal, fixed meaning. They are invested with plural and mobile significations that are constructed in the encounter between a proposal and a reception. The meanings attributed to their forms and

their themes depend upon the areas of competence or the expectations of the various publics that take hold of them. To be sure, the creators {or the 'powers' or the 'clerics') always aspire to pin down their meaning and proclaim the correct interpretation, the interpretation that ought to constrain reading (or viewing). But without fail reception invents, shifts about, distorts. Works are produced within a specific order that has its own rules, conventions, and hierarchies, but they escape all these and take on a certain density in their peregrinations - which can be in a very long time span - about the social world. Deciphered on the basis of mental and affective schemes that constitute the 'culture' {in the anthropological sense) of the communities that receive them, works turn the tables and become a precious resource for thinking about what is essential: the construction of social ties, individual subjectivity, and relationship with the sacred. Conversely, any work inscribes within its forms and its themes a relationship with the manner in which, in a given moment and place, modes of exercising power, social configurations, or the structure of personality are organized. Thought of (and thinking of himself or herself) as a demiurge, the writer none the less creates in a state of dependence. Dependence upon the rules (of patronage, subsidy, and the market) that define the writer's condition. Dependence (on an even deeper level) on the unconscious detern1inations that inhabit the work and that make it conceivable, communicable, and decipherable. To consider in this way that all works are anchored in the practices and the institutions of the social world is not to postulate any general equivalence among all the products of the mind. Some, better than others, never exhaust

Preface
their significative force. If we try to understan4 this by invoking the universality of beauty or the unity of human nature we will fall short of the truth. The essential gan1e is being played elsewhere, in the complex, subtle, shifting relationships established between the forms (symbolic or material) proper to works, which are unequally open to appropriation, and the habits or the concerns of the various publics for those works. What any cultural history must take into consideration today is the paradoxical articulation between a dljference the difference by means of which all societies, with varying modalities, have separated out from daily practice a particlar domain of huntan activity - and dependencies - the dependencies that take a variety of ways to inscribe aesthetic and intellectual invention within the conditions of possibility and intelligibility. This problematic connection is rooted in the very trajectory that gives works their most powerful meanings - meanings constructed on the aesthetic or reflective transfiguration of ordinary experiences, grasped on the basis of practices proper to those works' various publics. Reflection on how the figure of the author was constructed, on the rules for the formation of communities of readers, or on the significance invested in the building of libraries (with or without walls) may perhaps contribute to focusing a few of the questions that currently inhabit the disciplines of knowledge and public debate. By reintroducing variation and difference where the illusion of universality spontaneously springs up, such reflection may help us to get rid of some of our over-sure distinctions and some over-familiar truisms.

Far from being writers - founders of their own place, heirs of the peasants of earlier ages now working on the soil of language, diggers of wells and builders of houses readers are travellers; they move across lands belonging to someone else, like nomads poaching their way across fields they did not write, despoiling the wealth of Egypt to enjoy it themselves. Writing accumulates, stocks up, resists time by the establishment of a place and multiplies its production through the expansionism of reproduction. Reading takes no measures against the erosion of time (one forgets oneself and also forgets), it does not keep what it acquires, or it does so poorly, and each of the places through which it passes is a repetition of the lost paradise. 1 This magnificent passage from Michel de Certeau which contrasts writing - conservative, fixed, durable - and reading - always of the order of the ephemeral - constitutes both an obligatory base and a disquieting challenge for any history that hopes to inventory and make sense out of a practice (reading) that only rarely leaves traces, that is scattered in an infinity of singular acts, and that easily

Communities of Readers
shakes off all constraints. Such a proposal is based on a dual presupposition: that reading is not already inscribed in the text with no conceivable gap between the meaning assigned to it (by its author, by custom, by criticism, and so forth) and the interpretation that its readers might make of it; and, as a corollary, that a text exists only because there is a reader to give it meaning. To return to Michel de Certeau:
Whether it is a question of newspapers or Proust, the text has a meaning only through its readers; it changes along with them; it is ordered in accord with codes of perception that it does not control. It becomes a text only in its relation to the exteriority of the reader; by an interplay of implications and ruses between two sorts of 'expectation' in combination: the expectation that organizes a readable space (a literality), and one that organizes a procedure necessary for the actualization of the work (a reading). 2

The historian's task is thus to reconstruct the variations that differentiate the espaces lisibles - that is, the texts in their discursive and material forms - and those that ·govern the circumstances of their tffectuation - that is, the readings, understood as concrete practices and as procedures of interpretation. Michel de Certeau's suggestions provide a basis for suggesting some of what is at stake and the problems and conditions of possibility of this sort of history. Its space is usually defined by three poles that the academic tradition usually keeps separate: first, the analysis of texts, be they canonical or ordinary, to discern their structures, their themes, and their aims; second, the history of books and, beyond that, the history of all objects and all forms that bear texts; third, the study of practices that seize on

these objects and these forms in a variety of ways and produce differentiated uses and meanings. For me, a fundamental question underlies this approach that combines textual criticism, bibliography, and cultural history: in the societies of the ancien regime, how did increased circulation of printed matter transform forms of sociability, permit new modes of thought, and change people's relationship with power? Hence the need to stress the way in which the encounter between 'the world of the text' and 'the world of the reader' - to use Paul Ricoeur's terms - operates. 3 To reconstruct this process of the 'actualization' of texts in its historical dimensions first requires that we accept the notion that their meanings are dependent upon the forms through which they are received and appropriated by their readers (or hearers). Readers and hearers, in point of fact, are never confronted with abstract or ideal texts detached from all materiality; they manipulate or perceive objects and forms whose structures and modalities govern their reading (or their hearing), thus the possible comprehension of the text read (or heard). Against a purely semantic definition of the text (which inhabits not only structuralist criticism in all its variants but also the literary theories most attuned to a reconstruction of the reception of works), one must state that forms produce meaning and that a text, stable in its letter, is invested with a new meaning and status when the mechanistns that make it available to interpretation change. We must also keep in mind that reading is always a practice embodied in acts, spaces, and habits. Far from being a phenomenology that wipes out all concrete modalities of the act of reading and characterizes that act by its effects, which are postulated to be universal (as with the operation of response to the text that makes the subject
3

Communities of Readers
better understand himself or herself thanks to the mediation of interpretation), a history of reading must identify the specific mechanisms that distinguish the various com. munities of readers and traditions of reading. This move supposes the recognition of several sets of contrasts, the first of which is in the realm of reading ability. The essential but oversimplified separation of the literate from the illiterate does not exhaust the full range of differences in the reader's relation to writing. All who can read texts do not read them in the same fashion, and there is an enormous gap between the virtuosi among readers and the least skilled at reading, who have to oralize what they are reading in order to comprehend it and who are at ease only with a limited range of textual or typographical forms. There are equally great differences between the norms and conventions of reading that define, for each community of readers, legitimate uses of the book, ways to read, and the instruments and methods of interpretations. Finally, there are differences between the expectations and interests that various groups of readers invest in the practice of reading. Such expectations and interests, which govern practices, determine the way in which texts can be read and read differently by readers who do not have the same intellectual baggage or the same relationship with the written word. Michel de Certeau gives an illustration of this sort of approach when he discusses the characteristics of mystical reading: 'By "mystical readings" I mean the set of reading procedures advised or practiced in the field of experience of the solitaries or the collectives designated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as "illuminated," "mystic" or "spiritual".' 4 In this minor, marginal, and dispersed community that was the mystical milieu, reading was regulated by norms and habits that 4

Communities of Readers
invested the book with original functions: it replaced the institution of the church, held to be insufficient; it made discourse possible (the discourse of prayer, of communication with God, of the conversar); it indicated the practices by which spiritual experience could be constructed. The mystical relationship with the book can also be understood as a trajectory in which several 'moments' of reading succeed one another: the installation of an alterity that provides a basis for the subjective quest, the unfolding of a sense of joy, a physical reaction to the 'manducation' of the text that leaves its mark on the body, and, at the end of the process, cessation of reading, abandonment of the book, and absolute detachment. One of the first tasks of a history of reading that hopes to understand the varieties of the paradigmatic figure of the reader as poacher is thus to ascertain the networks of reading practices and the rules for reading proper to the various communities of readers - spiritual, intellectual, professional, and so forth. 5 But to read is always to read something. Naturally, if it is to exist the history of reading must be radically distinguished from a history of what is read: 'The reader emerges from the history of the book, in which he has long been merged, indistinct.... The reader was taken to be the effect of the book. Today he becomes detached fron1 those books whose mere shadow he was supposed to be. And now that shadow is unshackled, it takes on relief and acquires an independence.' 6 That founding independence is not an arbitrary liberty. It is limited by the codes and the conventions that regulate the practices of a membership community. It is .also limited by the discursive ·and material forms of the texts read. 'New readers make new texts and their new meanings are a function of their new forms.' 7 D. F. McKenzie 5

perspicaciously notes here the dual set of variations variations in the readers' resources and in textual and formal mechanisms - that any history that takes on the task of restoring the fluid and plural signification of texts must take into account. One can profit from McKenzie's dictum in several ways: by noting the major oppositions that distinguish the various modes of reading from one another; by specifying the practices most popular among readers; by focusing attention on the publishing formulas that offer old texts to new readers of a humbler sort and in greater number. This perspective reflects a dual dissatisfaction with the history of the book in France in the last twenty or thirty years, where the historians' chief concern has been to measure the unequal presence of the book in the various groups that made up the society of the ancien regime. This led to the construction (incidentally, quite necessarily so) of indicators to reveal cultural gaps at a given place and time: among such indicators are the percentage of probate inventories mentioning ownership of books, the classification of book collections according to the number of works they included, and thematic description of private libraries according to the place that the various bibliographical categories occupy in them. In this perspective, giving an account of the reading matter of the French between the sixteenth and the eighteenth century was above all a question of constructing data sets, establishing quantitative thresholds, and noting the cultural equivalents of social differences. These procedures were adopted collectively (by the author of the present work among others), and they permitted the accumulation of a body of knowledge without which further investigation would have been inconceivable. They raise problems, however. First, such procedures

6

G,ommunities of Readers
rest on a narrowly sociographic conception implicitly postulating that cultural cleavages are necessarily organized according to pre-existent social divisions. I think we need to reject this dependence that relates gaps in cultural practices to a priori social oppositions, whether on the n1acroscopic scale of contrasts between dominant and dominated or between the elites and the people or on the scale of smaller differentiations, as for exarnple among social groups in a hierarchy of conditions, professions, or levels of wealth. Cultural divisions are not obligatorily organized in accordance with the one grid of social divisions that supposedly commands the unequal presence of objects or differences in behaviour patterns. We must turn the perspective around and begin by designating the social areas in which each corpus of texts and each genre of printed matter circulates. Beginning with objects, in this fashion, rather than with classes or groups leads to considering that the French style of sociocultural history has too long continued to exist on the basis of a mutilated conception of the social. By privileging only socioprofessional classification it has forgotten that other ·and equally social principles of differentiation might explain cultural divisions even more pertinently. The same is true of genderbased and generationally based distinctions, of religious affiliations, of communitarian solidarities, of educative or corporative traditions, and more. Furthermore, the history of the book in its social and quantitative definition atten1pted to characterize cultural configurations on the basis of the categories of texts that were supposed to be specific to those configurations. This operation was doubly reductive. First, it equated the identification of differences with mere inequalities in distribution; second, it ignored the process by which a text takes on meaning for those who read it. Several shifts
7

Communities of Readers
of emphasis could be proposed to correct these postulates. The first situates the recognition of the differences most deeply rooted in society in differing uses of shared materials. In the societies of the ancien regime the same texts were appropriated by 'popular' readers and other readers more than has been thought. Either readers of more humble social condition were put in possession of books that were not specifically designed for them (as was the case of Menocchio, the Friuli miller, Jamerey Duval, the shepherd from Lorraine, or Menetra, the Paris glazier), 8 or else inventive and canny bookseller-printers made available to a very large clientele texts that formerly had circulated only in the narrow world of wealth and letters (which was the case with the pliegos sueltos of Castile and the Catalan plecs, English chapbooks or the publishing formula known in France under the generic title of the Bibliotheque bleue). What is essential is thus to understand how the same texts can be differently apprehended, manipulated, and comprehended. A second shift of emphasis reconstructs the networks of practices that organized historically and socially differentiated modes of access of texts. Reading is not uniquely an abstract operation of the intellect: it brings the body into play, it is inscribed in a space and a relationship with oneself or with others. This is why special attention should be paid to ways of reading that have disappeared in our contemporary world. One of these is reading aloud in its dual function of communicating the written word to those who are unable to decipher it themselves but also of cementing the interlocking forms of sociability that are emblematic of private life in the intimacy of the family circle, in worldly conviviality, and in literary circles and spheres of scholarly sociability. A history of reading must not limit itself to the genealogy of our own contemporary manner of reading, in silence and using only our eyes; it
8

Communities of Readers
must also (and perhaps above all) take on the task of retracing forgotten gestures and habits that have not existed for some time. The challenge matters because it reveals not only the distant foreignness of practices that were common long ago but also the specific structure of texts composed for uses that are not the uses of today's readers of those same texts. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the reading style implicit in a text, literary or not, was still often an oralization of the text, and the 'reader' was an implicit auditor of a read discourse. The work, which was addressed to the ear as much as to the eye, plays with forms and procedures that subject writing to demands more appropriate to oral 'performance'. Many examples of this sort of continuing link between the text and the human voice can be found, from the motifs in Don Quixote to the structure of texts adapted for the Bibliotheque bleue. 9 'Whatever they may do, authors do not write books. Books are not written at all. They are manufactured by scribes and other artisans, by mechanics and other engineers, and by printing presses and other machines.' 10 This remark can serve to introduce the third shift in emphasis that I would like to suggest. Contrary to representation elaborated by literature itself and taken up by the most quantitative form of history of the book, which state that the text exists in and of itself, separate from anything material, we need to remember that there is no text apart from the physical support that offers it for reading (or hearing), hence there is no comprehension of any written piece that does not at least in part depend upon the forms in which it reaches its reader. This means that we need to make a distinction between two sets of mechanisms, the ones that are part of the strategies of writing and the author's intentions, and the ones that result from publishing decisions or the constraints of the print shop. 9

True, authors do not write books: they write texts that become written objects, which may be hand-written, engraved, or printed (and, today, electronically reproduced and transmitted). The space between text and object, which is precisely the space in which meaning is constructed, has too often been forgotten, not only by the traditional sort of literary history that thinks of the work as an abstract text whose typographic forms are without importance, but also by the 'aesthetic of reception' that, in spite of its desire to historicize the readers' experience, postulates a pure and unmediated relationship between the 'signals' emitted by the text (which play with accepted literary conventions) and the 'horizon of expectation' of the public to which those signals are addressed. In this perspective the 'effect produced' in no way depends upon the material forms that operate as a vehicle for the text. 11 Still, those forms also fully contribute to fashioning the reader's expectations and to calling for a new public or novel uses. Thus we have been brought back to the triangle that was our point of departure, the relationship set up among the text, the book, and the reader. The variations in that relationship describe several simple figures for the connection between 'readable space' (espace lisible) and 'effectuation', to use Michel de Certeau's terms. The first variation considers a stable, literal text that is available for reading in printed forms that change. In his study of the innovations introduced into editions of William Congreve's plays at the beginning of the eighteenth century, D. F. McKenzie has shown how apparently insignificant formal changes (moving from a quarto to an octavo edition, numbering scenes, the presence or absence of a decorative element printed between one scene and the next, recalling the names of characters present at the 10

Communities

of Readers

beginning of each scene, marginal indications of the name of the character speaking, mention of exits and entrances} had an important effect on the status of the works. A new readability was created by a forn1at that was easier to manipulate and by a page layout that reproduced within the book something of the n1ovement of the staging, thus breaking with time-honoured conventions that required plays to be printed with no restitution of their theatrical character. This was thus a new manner of reading the same text, but it also provided a new horizon of reception because the mechanisms used in the octavo edition of 1710, borrowed from devices used for printed editions of French plays, gave a new legitimacy to Congreve's plays, henceforth 'classics' and part of the literary canon, and induced their author to make changes here and there to refine the style of his works and make thetn conform better to their new 'typographic' dignity. 12 Variations in the most purely formal aspects of a text's presentation can thus modify ·both its register of reference and its mode of interpretation. The same is true, on a greater scale, of the greatest change in the way texts were cast into print between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries, 'the definitive triumph of white over black' 13 - that is, the introduction of breathing space on to the page by the use of more paragraphs to break up an uninterrupted continuous text and by paragraph indentations that make the order of discourse immediately visib]e. The new publishers suggested a new reading of the same texts or the same genres, a reading that fragtnented the text into separate units and echoed the intellectual or discursive articulation of the argument in the visual articulation of the page. Chopping up the text in this manner could have farreaching implications where Scripture was concerned.
11

John Locke was troubled by the new custom of dividing the text of the Bible into chapter and verse. For him it risked obliterating the powerful coherence of the Word of God. Locke says, speaking of the Epistles of Paul, 'Not only the Common People take the Verses usually for distinct Aphorisms, but even Men of more advanc'd Knowledge in reading them, lose very much of the strength and force of the Coherence and the Light that depends on it.' The effects of breaking up Scripture in this manner were disastrous: it authorized every religious sect or party to found its legitimacy on the scriptural passages that seemed to support its views: If a Bible was printed as it should be, and as the several Parts of it were writ, in continued Discourses where the Argument is continued, I doubt not that the several Parties would complain of it, as an Innovation, and a dangerous Change in the publishing of those holy Books.... He [the member of a particular church) need but be furnished with Verses of Sacred Scriptures, containing Words and Expressions that are but flexible . . . and his System that has appropriated them to the Orthodoxie of his Church, makes them immediately strong and irrefragable Arguments for his Opinion. This is the Benefit of loose Sentences, and Scripture crumbled into Verses, which quickly tum into independent Aphorisms. 14 A second figure pertains when a text is transferred from one form of publishing to another, dictating both a transformation of the text and the constitution of a new public. This is quite obviously the case with the corpus of titles that made up the catalogue of the Bibliotheque bleue. If that series has long claimed the attention of French historians it is because it has seemed to furnish direct access to the 'popular culture' of the ancien regime,

12

Communities of Readers
which has been supposed to have been expressed and nourished by works such as these and distributed en masse among the humbler sort of readers. 15 This was not really the case, and for three main reasons. First, it is clear that the works that made up the French stock of the pedlar's book trade had never been written for that purpose. The Bibliotheque bleue was a publishing formula that dipped into the repertory of already published texts and picked out the ones that seemed most likely to meet the expectations of the broad public it sought to reach. Thus we need to take two precautions: not to take texts in the familiar blue format as 'popular' in and of themselves because they belonged to all the genres of learned literature; to keep in mind that such texts usually had an earlier publishing existence and often a long publishing history before they entered the repertory of books for a wide audience. A study of the works in the 'popular' catalogue has shown that techniques of the most formal and material kind can by themselves inscribe indications of cultural differentiation in published works. In fact, the basic specificity of the Bibliotheque bleue resided in editorial changes made in the texts in order to make them readable by the wide clientele that the publishers were aiming at. The vast labour of adaptation- shortening texts, simplifying them, cutting them up, providing illustrations- was commanded by how the bookseller-publishers who specialized in that market envisioned their customers' abilities and expectations. Thus the very structure of their books was governed by the way that book publishers thought that their target clientele read. That reading style was always thought to demand such visible signals as anticipatory headings, recapitulative summaries, or woodcuts that functioned as reading

13

Communities of Readers
protocols much like the mansions in the system of the arts of memory- a style of reading at ease only with brief and self-enclosed sequences set off from one another and readers content with a minimal level of coherence. It was certainly not the manner of reading typical of the lettered elites of the age, even if certain notables deigned to buy the blue-covered books. Works printed for a broad public counted on their readers' previous knowledge. By the recurrence of extremely coded forms, by the repetition of motifs that return from one work to another, and by reuse of the same illustrations, an acquaintance with texts that the reader had already encountered was mobilized into serving for the comprehension of unfamiliar reading matter. In this way the 'blue' catalogue organized a manner of reading that was more recognition than true discovery. It is thus specific formal aspects of the 'blue' editions and the modifications that they imposed on the works they made use of that reveal their 'popular' character. In proposing this re-evaluation of the Bibliotheque bleue my intention has not been uniquely to reach a better understanding of the most powerful of the instruments of acculturation to the written culture in ancien regime France. 16 It has also been to say that identification of sociocultural differentiations and a study of formal and material mechanisms, far from being mutually exclusive, are necessarily connected. This is so not only because forms are modelled on the expectations and abilities attributed to the public at which they are aimed, but above all because works and objects produce their social area of reception much more than they are produced by crystallized and previously existent divisions. Lawrence W. Levine has proposed a fine demonstration of this. 17 Analyzing the way in which Shakespeare's plays were 14

Communities of Readers
produced in America (mixed in with other genres such as melodran1a, farce, circus turns, dance, and so forth}, Levine shows how this type of representation created a numerous public that was 'popular' in that it was not limited to the lettered elite and that it participated actively in the performance by its emotions and reactions. In the late nineteenth century the strict division that was established among genres, styles, and places split up this 'general' public, reserving Shakespeare to the 'legitimate' theatre and a smaller audience and sending off the rest of the audience to more 'popular' entertainments. Changes in the actual form in which Shakespeare's plays were presented (but the same was true of symphonic music, the opera, and works of art} played a large part in the constitution of a 'cultural bifurcation', and a time of mixed and shared offerings was succeeded by a time in which a process of cultural distinction produced a social separation. The traditional mechanisms for representing the Shakespearian repertory in America were thus of the same order as the 'typographic' transformations that the publishers of the Bibliotheque bleue performed on the works they chose: in both cases, the intent was to inscribe the text into a cultural matrix that was not the one that its original creators had in mind, and by that means to permit 'readings', comprehensions, and uses that might have been disqualified by other intellectual habits. These two examples lead us to consider cultural gaps as the effect of dynamic processes rather than as an expression of static and fixed divisions. On the one hand, a transformation in the forms and the mechanisms through which a text is proposed authorized new appropriations, thus it created new publics and new uses. On the other hand, the fact that an entire society shared the same objects invited a search for new differences to mark
15

Communities

of Readers

distances that had been maintained. The trajectory of print works in ancien regime France stands as witness to this. It was as if the distinctions among ways to read were progressively reinforced as printed matter became less rare, less often confiscated, and a more ordinary commodity. Whereas the mere possession of a book had long signified cultural difference, with the conquests of printing, reading postures and typographical objects were gradually invested with that function. Henceforth readers of distinction and handsome books stood opposed to hastily printed works and their awkward decipherers. As we have seen, however, both groups often read the same texts, whose plural and contradictory significations were invented along with their varying uses. This means that the question becomes one of selection: why did certain texts lend themselves better than others to durable and multiple reuse? 18 Or at least why did book publishers consider them capable of reaching very different publics? The response lies in the subtle relationships that were set up between the structure of the works, which were not all open to reappropriation in the same degree, and the multiple determinations, both institutional and formal, that regulated their possible 'application' (in the hermeneutic sense of the term) to very different historical situations. There is a third figure of the relationship among text, .print, and reading when a text that is stable in its letter and fixed in its form is apprehended by new readers who read it in other ways than did previous readers. 'A book changes by the fact that it does not change when the world changes' 19 or, to change the statement to fit the scope of the present work, ' ... when its mode of reading changes'. This remark is enough to justify a projected history of reading practices that would seek to identify the 16

Communities

major oppositions that can give different meanings to a same text. It is perhaps time to question three of these fundamental cleavages, which are held to be certain. First, the opposition between a reading in which comprehension depends upon oralization, either out loud or mumbled, and another, possibly visual, reading. 20 Even though his chronology is open to question, let me recall Michel de Certeau's remark about the reader's freedom and silent reading: Reading has become, over the past three centuries, a visual poem. It is no longer accompanied, as it used to be, by the murmur of a vocal articulation or by the movement of a muscular manducation. To read without uttering the words aloud or at least mumbling them is a 'modem' experience, unknown for millennia. In earlier times, the reader interiorized the text; he made his voice the body of the other; he was its actor. Today, the text no longer imposes its own rhythm on the subject, it no longer manifests itself through the reader's voice. This withdrawal ofthe body, which is the condition of autonomy, is a distancing of the text. It is the reader's habeas corpus. 21 The second accepted cleavage falls between an 'intensive', reverential, and respectful reading of a small number of books that relies on hearing and memory and an 'extensive' reading that consumes many texts, passes nonchalantly from one text to the next, and holds less sacred what is read. 22 The third cleavage is between a private, cloistered, solitary reading, considered to be one of the essential elements for constituting a sphere of private life, and the collective reading - both disciplined and rebellious - of communitarian spaces. 23 These widely accepted oppositions suggest a chronology that sees as major mutations the gradual advances in
17

Communities

of Readers

silent reading in the Middle Ages and the entry into the world of extensive reading in the late eighteenth century. They prompt several reflections, however: some of these would reduce the simplicity of the dichotomies present in these contrasts by shifting attention to gradations within each opposed entity, by introducing nuances into the criteria that too abruptly differentiate styles of reading, and by reversing the automatic association of the collective with the popular and the elite with the private. 24 Others suggest a connection atnong three sets of transformations whose effects have often been imperfectly untangled: 'revolutions' that have taken place in techniques for the reproduction of texts (first among them, a shift from 'scribal culture' to 'print culture'); changes in the very forms of the book (the change from the roll or volumen to the book in signatures or codex during the early centuries of the Christian era was the most fundamental of these but other and less sweeping changes modified the visual aspect of the printed page between the sixteenth and eighteenth century); 25 wide-scale change in reading skills and in modes of reading. These different evolutions did not develop at the same pace and were not punctuated by the same breaking-points. ~rhe most interesting question posed to and by the history of reading today is certainly that of the ways in which these three sets of mutations - technological, formal, and cultural - related to one another. The response to that question obviously depends upon a re-evaluation of the trajectories and divisions characteristic of the society of the ancien regime. More than is admitted, they were organized on the basis of the presence of written matter. That presence has long been gauged uniquely in one of two ways: either by signature counts aimed at establishing literacy rates, hence at evaluating

18

Communities of Readers
variations in the ability to read according to ages, sites, sexes, and conditions; or by scrutiny of library inventories drawn up by notaries or booksellers in an attempt to measure the circulation of books and reading traditions. In societies of the ancien regime as in our own, however, access to print cannot be reduced to book ownership alone: every book that is read is not necessarily a book that is personally owned, and all printed matter kept in the home is not obligatorily a book. Moreover, written materials lay at the very heart of the culture of the illiterate and were present in rituals, public spaces, and the work place. 26 Thanks to speech, which deciphered writing, and to the image, which mirrored it, written matter was made accessible even to those who were incapable of reading it or who, left to their own devices, would have had only a rudimentary comprehension of it. Literacy rates do not give an accurate measure of familiarity with the written word - all the more so since in older societies, where learning to read and learning to write were two separate and successive operations, there were many individuals (women in particular) who left school knowing how to read at least a little but not how to write. 27 Similarly, individual possession of a book is an inadequate indication of how often those who were too poor to have any sort of 'library' in their homes might have handled a printed text. Even if it is totally impossible to establish the number of readers who were not even able to sign their names or the number of readers who owned no books (or at least no books worthy of being appraised by the notary who drew up the inventory) but who could read signs and posters, news-sheets and chapbooks, we none the less have to postulate that they were many in order to comprehend the impact of printed written matter on the older forms of
19

Communities

a culture that was still largely oral, action-based, and iconographic. The two modes of expression and communication dovetailed in many ways. To take first the ways in which writing and gesture mixed: not only was the written word at the centre of urban festivities such as religious ceremonies, but a number of texts were intended to cancel themselves out as discourse and to produce practical results in behaviour recognized as being in conformity with social or religious norms. This was the case with the civility books, which aimed at teaching the rules of polite social intercourse or Christian propriety. 28 There was also a dovetailing of speech and writing, which operated in two ways: first, the texts destined by their author and (more often) by their publisher to the most popular public often contained formulas or themes that came directly from the culture of the tale and oral recitation. The writing style of certain occasionnels (newssheets) that imitate the speech patterns of tale-tellers and the variants introduced in the 'blue' editions of fairy tales (which all originally came from literary collections) are good examples of an orality coming to the surface in printed matter. 29 Second, as we have seen, a number of 'readers' apprehended texts only thanks to the mediation of a voice reading them. Comprehending the specificity of this relationship with the written word thus supposes that not all reading must necessarily be individual, solitary, and silent, but, quite to the contrary, that one must acknowledge the importance and the diversity of reading aloud, a practice that has largely been lost. This acknowledgement, which points to the strength of the penetration of print culture in ancien regime societies, leads to several others. First, it can account for the importance given to written matter and to the objects that bore writing by all the authorities who intended to

20

Communities of Readers
regulate behaviour and fashion minds. Hence the pedagogical, acculturating, and disciplining role attributed to the texts put into circulation for a wide readership; hence also the controls exercised over printed matter, which was subjected to censorship to eliminate anything that might threaten religious or moral order. Michel de Certeau invited us to recognize both the efficacy of these constraints, which were more and more binding as the individual was more strongly connected with the institution that decreed them ('The creativity of the reader grows as the institution that controlled it declines'), 30 and the various modalities for bridling the reader's interpretation, which ranged from exterior censorship - administrative, judiciary, inquisitorial, scholastic, and so forth- to constraining mechanisms within the book itself. Texts from bygone years construct representations of the possible uses of the written word and the various ways of handling printed matter in which we can recognize the cleavages that those who produced books held to be decisive. Such perceptions are essential to the extent that they underlie strategies for writing and for publishing that were governed by the supposed skills and expectations of the various target publics. Hence those perceptions acquire an efficacy traces of which can be found in explicit protocols for reading, in the forms given to typographical objects, or in the transformations that changed a text when it was given to new readers in a new publishing formula. It is thus on the basis of the various representations of reading and of the dichotomies constructed in the early modern age (between the reading of a text and the reading of an image; between literate reading and hesitant reading; between intimate reading and communitarian reading) that we must attempt to understand the uses of and adjustments made in these print pieces humbler

than the book but just as omnipresent and which ranged from images volantes (illustrated broadsheets) and placards (topical illustrations and commentary) to the occasionnels and the little blue books (which often had illustrations). Representations of older forms of reading and of the differences among them, as they are revealed on the practical level by the process of casting a text into printed form, or representations of their normative purposes in literary, pictorial, and autobiographical works constitute the basic data for an archaeology of reading practices. None the less, although they express the contrasts that were uppermost in the minds of their contemporaries, they mask other and less clearly perceived cleavages. For example, it is certain that many practices reversed the very terms of the opposition that has so often been depicted between solitary reading in the privacy of a bourgeois or aristocratic setting and reading in common among popular listeners. In reality, reading aloud while others listened long remained one of the practices that cemented elite sociability; conversely, printed matter penetrated to the very heart of the humble home, where it imbued modest objects that were by no means always books with traces of an important moment in private life, a memory of an emotion, or a sign of identity. Contrary to the classical image of 'the people', a product of the early modem age,, 'the people' is not always to be sought in the plural, but rather in the secret solitude of the humble practices of individuals who cut out the images of the occasion nels, who coloured printed engravings, and who read the chapbooks for simple enjoyment. The approach proposed in the present work (and put into effect in a few others) is tied to a particular terrain (France between the sixteenth and the eighteenth century) and to a specific problem (the effects of the penetration

of printed written matter on the culture of the greater number). It attempts to put into operation two propositions of Michel de Certeau. The first recalls, against all reductive attempts to deny the creative and inventive force of practice, that reading is never totally constraint and that it cannot be deduced from the texts it makes use of. The second stresses that readers' tactics, insinuated in the lieu propre (place of their own) produced by the strategies of writing, obey rules, follow logical systems, and imitate models. This reflects the paradox underlying any history of reading, which is that it must postulate the liberty of a practice that it can only grasp, tnassively, in its determinations. Constructing communities of readers as 'interpretive communities' (Stanley Fish's expression), discerning how material forms affect meaning, localizing social difference in practices more than in statistical distributions - these are the routes laid out for anyone who wishes to understand as a historian the 'silent production' that is 'the activity of reading'. 31

D. F. McKenzie has stressed the fundamental kinship between bibliography {in its classic definition of a study of the physical aspects of the book) and all forms of structuralist criticism, noting, 'The congruence of bibliography and criticism lay precisely in their shared view of the self-sufficient nature of the work of art or text.... In neither case were precedent or subsequent processes thought to be essential to critical or bibliographical practice. ' 1 For both the New Criticism and analytical bibliography, the production of meaning relied on the automatic and impersonal operation of a system of signs either the system instituting the language of the text or the one organizing the form of the printed object. Consequently, both approaches refused to consider that the manner in which a work is read, received, and interpreted has any importance for establishing its meaning, and both proclaimed 'the death of the author' (as Barthes titled his famous essay) and stripped authorial intention of any special pertinence. In this perspective, dominant in the English-speaking world (Great Britain, the United States, Australia, New Zealand), the history of the book

Figures of the Author
was thus a history with neither readers nor authors. What it saw as essential was the process of the fabrication of the book, a process apprehended from traces left in the object itself and explained by editorial decisions, printshop practices, and the customs of the print trade. Paradoxically (if one remembers that the first goal of a study of the material aspects of the book has traditionally been to establish and publish correct and authentic texts), 2 bibliographic tradition has contributed greatly to the effacement of the author that was characteristic of the hegemony of semiotics. In France, where the history of the book was more immediately cultural and social, the perspective could have been (perhaps should have been) different, but the historians' primary interests bore it elsewhere. 3 Scholars were more interested in ascertaining wealth, alliances, and hierarchies in the milieu of those who manufactured and sold books: merchant-booksellers, printers, compositors and pressmen, type founders, engravers, bookbinders, and others. Historians attempted to reconstruct the circulation of books, inequalities in book ownership among the various groups in society, and the impact of the book on mentalities. This approach privileged a quantitative treatment of massive data sets, relying on such materials as lists of books contained in probate inventories, catalogues printed for public auction sales of libraries, or, when historians had the good luck to come across them in the archives, booksellers' account books. It focused, if not on reading practices, at least on the sociology of readers. The author was forgotten in French history of the book as in the Anglo-Saxon bibliographic tradition - somewhat paradoxically when we recall Lucien Febvre's and Henri-Jean Martin's original programme 'to examine the influence and the practical significance of the printed book during the first 300 years of its existence'. 4 In the tradition of the social history 26

Figures of the Author
of print as it has developed in France, books have readers but they do not have authors- or, more precisely, authors do not enter into that history's domain of competence: they are wholly the province of literary history and its time-honoured genres- biography, the study of a school or a current, or the description of an intellectual milieu. Whether the history of the book neglects the author or leaves him or her to others, it has been practised as if its techniques and discoveries were irrelevant to the history of those who produced texts, or as if that history had no importance for the comprehension of works. In recent years, however, we have seen the return of the author. Literary criticism has distanced itself from points of view exclusively focused on the internal operation of the system of signs that constitutes a text, and it has attempted to set works back within their history. This move has taken various forms. The 'aesthetic of reception' aimed at describing the dialogue between an individual work and its readers' 'horizon of expectations', defined as the set of conventions and references shared by the work's public or publics. This approach, far from taking the meaning of the text as stable, univocal, and universal, thus comprehended it as historically constructed and as produced in the dialogue that exists between the propositions contained in the work (which are in part controlled by the author's intentions) and the readers' responses. 5 The New Historicism is more interested in situating the literary work in relation to 'ordinary' texts (of a practical, juridical, political, or religious nature) that constitute the raw materials on which writing operates and that make its intelligibility possible. 6 With the sociology of cultural production, based on concepts forged by Pierre Bourdieu, analysis shifts to the laws of operation and the hierarchies proper to a gtven field (literary, arttstlc,

27

Figures of the Author
academic, religious, political, and so forth), to the structural relationships situating the various positions defined within a field, to the individual or collective strategies that those positions command, and to the transfer into the works themselves (in terms of genre, form, theme, and style) of the social conditions of their production.7 Finally, the bibliography defined as a 'sociology of texts' proposed by D. F. McKenzie focuses on the way in which the physical forms through which texts are transmitted to their readers (or their auditors) affect the process of the construction of meaning. Understanding the reasons and the effects of such physical devices (for the printed book) as format, page layout, the way in which the text is broken up, the conventions governing its typographical presentation, and so forth, necessarily refers back to the control that the authors but sometimes the publishers exercised over the forms charged with expressing intention, orienting reception, and constraining interpretation. 8 In spite of striking differences, even divergences among them, a common characteristic of all these approaches is that they reconnect the text with its author; the work with the intentions or the positions of its producer. This is of course not a restoration of the superb and solitary romantic figure of the sovereign author whose primary or final intention contains the meaning of the work and whose biography commands its writing with transparent immediacy. As he returns in literary criticism or literary sociology the author is both dependent and constrained. He is dependent in that he is not the unique master of the meaning of his text, and his intentions, which provided the impulse to produce the text, are not necessarily imposed either on those who tum his text into a book (booksellerpublishers or print workers) or on those who appropriate it by reading it. He is constrained in that he undergoes the

28

Figures of the Author
multiple determinations that organize the social space of literary production and that, in a more general sense, determine the categories and the experiences that are the very matrices of writing. The multifaceted return of the author in critical problematics takes us back to the question that Michel Foucault posed in a famous essay that has become an obligatory reference: What is an author?9 In this essay Foucault distinguished between the 'sociohistorical analysis of the author's persona' and the more fundamental problem of the construction of an 'author-function' as a prime means of classifying discourses. Foucault states that, far from being universal or relevant to all texts in all ages, the attribution of a proper name to a work is a way of discriminating . between texts. It is valid only for certain classes of texts ('The author-function is characteristic of the mode of existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a society'); it supposes a state of law that recognizes the author's penal responsibility and the concept of literary property ('The author-function is linked to the juridical and institutional system that encompasses, determines, and articulates the universe of discourses'). The author-function stands at some distance from the empirical evidence according to which every text has a redactor; it is the result of 'specific and complex operations' that put the unity, the coherence, and the inscription into historical context of a work (or a set of works) into relation with the identity of a constructed subject. This operation relies on a dual process of selection. First, the texts assignable to the author-function must be separated from the many texts that an individual may produce ('How can one define a work amid the millions of traces left by someone after his death?'). Second, one must pick from among the innumerable events that constitute a biography

29

Figures

and must retain the facts pertinent to a definition of the author's position. Although it is not his prime objective, Foucault sketches a history of the emergence of (and variations on) the attribution of texts by identification with a proper name the name of the author - endowed with a quite specific function. In the original version of 'Qu'est-ce qu'un auteur?' Foucault outlined three chronological stages. The first, and the only one that commentators remark on with any frequency, is the time when 'a system of ownership for texts came into being ... strict rules concerning author's rights, author-publisher relations, rights of reproduction, and related matters were enacted - at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century'. This strong connection between the individuality of the author and the inscription of the activity of writing and publishing within the regime of private property is not, however, the founding principle of the author-function. The function is older and rooted in other determinations:
We should note that, historically, this type of ownership has always been subsequent to what one might call penal appropriation. Texts, books, and discourses really began to have authors (other than mythical, 'sacralized' and 'sacralizing' figures) to the extent that authors became subject to punishment, that is, to the extent that discourses could be transgressive.

Foucault proposes no date for that 'penal appropriation' linking the author-function to the exercise of power by an authority with the right to censor, judge, and punish rather than, as formerly, to the juridical conventions regulating relations between private individuals. A third
30

Figures of the Author
remark none the less hints that, thus defined, the authorfunction predates the modern world. To illustrate the point that 'the author-function does not affect all discourses in a universal and constant way', Foucault evokes the radical reversal that, according to him, 'occurred in the seventeenth century or eighteenth century', when rules for the attribution of texts belonging to 'scientific' and 'literary' discourse were exchanged. After that watershed moment, the authority of scientific statements was founded on 'their membership in a systematic ensemble' of pre-established truths rather than on reference to particular authors; 'literary discourse', on the other hand, 'came to be accepted only when endowed with the author-function'. Formerly the reverse had been true: There was a time when the texts that we today call 'literary' (narratives, stories, epics, tragedies, comedies) were accepted, put into circulation, and valorized without any question about the identity of their author; their anonymity caused no difficulties since their ancientness, whether real or imagined, was regarded as a sufficient guarantee of their status. On the other hand, those texts that we now would call scientific - those dealing with cosmology and the heavens, medicine and illnesses, natural sciences and geography - were accepted in the Middle Ages, and accepted as 'true,' only when marked with the name of their author. It is not my intention to debate the validity of the change that Foucault notes in this passage but rather to note that he recognizes that, for certain classes of texts, reference to the author was functional as early as the Middle Ages. A hasty reading must not lead us to reduce Foucault's thought to oversimplified formulas: in no way does he

31

Figures of the Author
postulate an exclusive and determinant connection between literary property and the author-function; between 'the system of property that characterizes our society' and a system for the attribution of texts founded on the category of the subject. By moving the figure of the author back in time and by articulating it with mechanisms for controlling the circulation of texts or for lending them authority, Foucault's essay invites us to a retrospective investigation that gives the history of the conditions of the production, dissemination, and appropriation of texts particular pertinence. Such a history would lead - and in fact has led in several recent studies - to a reconsideration of the context in which the concept of literary property first appeared. 10 The first major revision suggested that the affirmation of literary ownership, far from arising from a particular application of a modern individual property law, derived directly from the book trade's defence of permissions to print - authorizations that guaranteed exclusive rights to a work to the bookseller who had obtained title to it. In England and in France, it was really the monarchy's attempts to limit the privileges, which traditionally granted perpetual rights, that led the bookseller-publishers to link the irrevocability of their rights to recognition of the author's ownership of his or her work. The strategy of the London booksellers' opposition to the Statute of 1709, which set a fourteen-year limit on copyrights (prolonged for another fourteen years if the author was still alive), has points of similarity with Diderot's strategy in the 1760s when he defended Paris booksellers who were concerned that perpetual renewals of their privileges n1ight be done away with. The London booksellers attempted to safeguard the perpetuity of their copyrights by treating the property rights of the author who ceded a manuscript to
32

Figures of the Author
them as a common law right. Diderot attempted to profit from the opportunity offered him to demonstrate authors' full literary property by presenting the privilege as a perpetual right of ownership rather than as a favour accorded by the sovereign. Diderot states: 'I repeat: the author is master of his work or no one in society is master of his wealth. The bookseller possesses it as it was possessed by the author.' Thus for Diderot the writer's ownership founded the legitimacy of the privilege; conversely, it was the imprescriptibility of the privilege that manifested the author's rights. 11 Thus what Mark Rose has to say about England might well be applied to France: 'It might be said that the London booksellers invented the modem proprietary author, constructing him as a weapon in their struggle with the booksellers of the provinces' 12 - those same provincial booksellers whose activities depended almost entirely on reprints made possible by the suppression of perpetual permissions accorded to the powerful booksellers of the two capitals. When the governing powers recognized the authors' rights over their works, they did so in the ancient logic of the privilege. This was true in the case with the Statute of 1709, which attempted to break the monopoly of the London booksellers by giving authors the right to demand a copyright themselves. It was also the case in France with the decree of the king's council of 1777 that stated that the book trade privilege was a 'grace founded in justice' (not founded by 'a rightful proprietorship') and that the permiss'ions that the author had obtained in his own name were perpetual and patrimonial: 'He will enjoy his privilege, for himself and his heirs, in perpetuity.' In neither land did authors have an absolute right to their property - in England because of the limited duration of the copyright, even when granted to the author; in France

33

Figures of the Author
because if the author ceded a manuscript to a bookseller, the latter's privilege (the minimum duration of which was ten years) was valid only 'during the life of the authors, in the event that they survive the expiration of the privileges'. In neither system of law was literary ownership equated with the ownership of real property, which was inalienable and freely transmissible. Thus literary ownership had to be justified, whether it was considered absolute by booksellers who used the concept in defence of perpetual privileges and copyrights or whether it was considered limited by the state, which recognized it in order to allow the constitution of a public domain in printing. The 1777 law states, for example, that 'all booksellers and printers may obtain, after the expiration of the privilege for a work and the death of its author, a permission to print an edition without the granting of this permission to one or several persons preventing anyone else from obtaining a similar permission'. In the debates and lawsuits involving book trade permissions in England, France and Germany, two systems for legitimizing the author's rights were used, either simultaneously or concurrently. The first, explicitly or implicitly founded on a reference to the theory of natural law as formulated by Locke, considered the author's ownership to be the fruit of individual labour. This theme appeared in 1725 in a memoir that the booksellers' and printers' guild in Paris, eager to defend privileges even at that early date, commissioned from the jurist Louis d'Hericourt. The memoir states that the work produced by an author is 'the fruit of a labour that is personal to him, which he must have the liberty to dispose of at will'. 13 The same thought runs through the arguments of the London booksellers: 'Labour gives a man a natural right of property in that which he produces: literary
34

Figures of the Author
compositions are the effect of labour; authors. have therefore a natural right of property in their works. ' 14 In France, the decree of the king's council of August 1777 implicitly linked the perpetuity of the permissions accorded to authors and the specificity of their 'labour': His Majesty has recognized that the book trade privilege is a grace founded in justice that has as its object, if it is accorded to the author, to reward his labour; if it is obtained by a bookseller, to assure him the reimbursement of his advance payments and compensation for his expenses, so that this difference in the reasons determining a privilege will produce [a difference) in its duration. Hence the 'more extended grace' that was accorded to authors. Whether they were considered to reflect full proprietorship or compensation, the author's rights over his work found basic justification in the assimilation of writing to labour. The need for a second system of legititnation arose out of objections raised to the very notion of a private appropriation of ideas. In England the adversaries of perpetual copyright held that literary works should be treated in the same way as 'mechanical' inventions. Such critics argued that both were produced by assembling elements available to everyone and should therefore be subjected to similar legislation, hence copyrights should be limited to fourteen years just as patents for the exclusive exploitation of technological inventions were: 'A mechanic Invention, and a literary Composition, exactly agree in Point of Similarity; the one therefore is no more entitled to be the object of Common Law Property than the other.' 15 In France, as Carla Hesse has shown, men such as Condorcet or Sieyes held unlimited literary property to be unjust because ideas

35

Figures of the Author
belonged to everyone, and held it contrary to the progress of Enlightenment because it instituted one person's monopoly over a body of knowledge that should be for the common good. Thus, they argued, literary property should not be absolute but rather the public interest dictated that it should be severely limited. 16 To parry arguments of this sort the champions of authors' exclusive and perpetual rights shifted the basic criterion of those rights. They argued that although ideas could be held in common and shared widely, the same was not true of the form in which the irreducible singularity of style and sentiment was expressed. The legitimation of literary property was thus based on a new aesthetic perception designating the work as an original creation recognizable by the specificity of its expression. This concept combining a unique form, the author's genius, and the inalienability of the author's ownership was argued during the conflicts engendered in England by the Statute of 1709, in particular by William Blackstone in Tonson v. Collins in 1760. It found its most radical formulations in open polemics in Germany between 1773 and 1794 in which (as was also true in France and England) discussion of book trade privileges was linked to a debate about the very nature of literary creation. The controversy, to which such writers as Zacharias Becker, Kant, Fichte, and Herder contributed, resulted in a new definition of the work, now no longer characterized by the ideas that it embodied (since ideas cannot be the object of individual appropriation) but by its form - that is, by the particular way in which an author produces, assembles, expresses, and presents concepts. 17 The text, which results from an organic process comparable to Nature's creations and is invested with an aesthetic of originality, transcends the circumstantial materiality of the book - a transcendence
36

Figures of the Author
that distinguishes it from a technological invention 18 and it acquires an identity immediately referable to the subjectivity of its author rather than to divine presence, tradition, or genre. This theory of the work prefigures the main traits of the author-function as Foucault presents it, where the author is 'the principle of a certain unity of writing' different from all others and 'a particular source of expression' manifested in all the creations attributed to that author. Thus in the latter half of the eighteenth century a somewhat paradoxical connection was made between a desired professionalization of literary activity (which should provide remuneration in order for writers to live from their writings) and the authors' representation of themselves in an ideology of literature founded on the radical autonomy of the work of art and the disinterestedness of the creative act. 19 On the one hand, the poetic or philosophic work became a negotiable commodity endowed with a valeur commer,ante, as Diderot put it, hence could be the object of . a contract and evaluated in monetary terms. On the other hand, the work was held to result from a free and inspired activity motivated by its internal necessities alone. When authors shifted from the patronage system (where retribution for their writing usually preceded the act of writing in the form of a sinecure or followed it in the form of gratifications) to operate in the market, where immediate and monetary profit was expected from the sale of a tnanuscript to a bookseller (or, for a dramatist, from a percentage of the proceeds of performances of his plays), this shift was accompanied by an apparent! y contradictory change in the ideology of writing, henceforth defined by the urgency and absolute freedom of creative power. 20 The connection established between inspiration and merchandise doubly reversed the traditional view of
37

literary activity. The notion that 'Glory is the Reward of Science, and those who deserve it, scorn all meaner Views ' 21 prompted the objection that it was simple justice for the labour of writing to involve pecuniary profit. Formerly, dependency was the norm for authors with neither a public office nor independent means; now that dependency stood in stark contrast to the consubstantial independence of all creative invention. 22 A radical reversal different from the one discussed by Foucault thus seems to have occurred during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Before, the author's subjection to obligations created by client relations and patronage ties was accompanied by a radical incommensurability between literary works and economic transactions. After the mid-century the situation was reversed when a possible and necessary monetary appreciation of literary compositions, remunerated as labour and subject to the laws of the market, was founded on an ideology of creative and disinterested genius that guaranteed the originality of the work. It is tempting to draw a close connection between the modem definition of the author and the resources (or the demands} inherent in the publication of printed texts. In his study of Samuel Johnson, whose life Boswell's biography made 'the model of the poetic role in the age of print', Alvin Kernan stresses the relationship between the constitution of a market for works - a market that only printing could make possible - and the affirmation of the author. In the 'new print-based, author-centered literary system' in late eighteenth-century England the author - at least the successful author - could enjoy a financial independence that freed him from the obligations of patronage and enabled him to acknowledge his published works. This new model broke with the classic figure of the gentleman writer or the gentletnan amateur formerly

38

Figures of the Author
accepted even by writers who were by no means of aristocratic birth. In the traditional definition, the author lived not by the pen but from investments and landholdings or public office; he scorned print and expressed an aristocratic 'antipathy to a medium that perverted the primary courtly literary values of privacy and rarity'; he preferred the chosen public of his peers, manuscript circulation for his works, and concealment of his name in an anonymous work. When recourse to printing became unavoidable the effacement of the author that was typical of the 'courtly tradition of anonymity' took several forms. The author might choose to leave his name off the title page (as with Swift). He might use the fictional device of a manuscript found by chance: Thomas Gray wrote, speaking of his Elegy in a Country Churchyard, 'If [the printer] would add a Line or two to say it came into his Hands by Accident, I should like it better.' Or he might create an apocryphal author: Thomas Rowley, a monk from Bristol, was the declared author of poetns actually written by Thomas Chatterton, and James MacPherson invented a Celtic bard, Ossian, presenting himself as merely the translator of the works he had in fact written. These values and practices characteristic of the 'literary ancien regime' had been undermined, however, by 'a new world of letters based on the realities of print technology and its market economics'. The new economics of writing supposed the full visibility of the author, the original creator of a work from which he could legitimately expect to profit. 23 Definitions in French-language dictionaries of the latter seventeenth century seem to confirm the association between the author and print publication. In 1690 Furetiere's Dictionnaire universe! gave seven meanings for the word auteur, and the one concerning La litterature came
39

Figures of the Author
only in sixth place, after definitions in the realms of philosophy and religion ('one who has created or produced something. Said par excellence of the first Cause which is God'), technical ('said in particular of those who are the first Inventors of something'), practical ('said also of those who are the cause of something'), political ('said also of Leaders of a party, an opinion, a conspiracy, or a rumour going about'), and genealogical ('the author of the race of a house, of a family'). It precedes the juridical definition: 'In terms of the Palace [of Justice], one calls Authors Those who have acquired the right to possess some inheritance by sale, exchange, donation, or other contract.' The word is thus not immediately invested with a literary meaning, its first uses situating it in the register of natural creation, material invention, and a chain of connected actions. When it arrives at the literary meaning, the Dictionnaire universe/ specifies, 'Author, in literature, is said of all those who have brought some book into the light. Now one says it only of those who have had a book or books printed.' The dictionary adds as an example of the use of the term, 'That man finally has risen to be an Author, has been printed.' The term 'author' presupposed printed circulation of works and, in return, recourse to the press distinguished the 'author' from the 'writer', whom Furetiere defines without reference to printing: 'Escrivain, is said also of those who have composed Books, Works.' Ten years before Furetiere, the Dictionnaire Fran{ais of Richelet had already established a necessary connection between the author and printing in its second definition of the word (after the prime meaning of 'the first who has invented something, who has said something, who is cause of something that has been done'). The entry reads: 'He who has composed some printed book', and it is

40

Figures of the Author
followed by illustrative examples: 'Ablancour, Pascal, Voiture, and Vaugelas are excellent French Authors. Queen Marguerite, the daughter of Henry Ill, was an author. ' 24 In his series of examples Furetiere also takes care to mention the presence of women among authors: 'One says also of a woman that she has risen [s'est erigee] as an Author when she has made some book or theatrical work. ' 25 For these two dictionaries of the late seventeenth century, the term 'author' is not to be applied to anyone who writes a work; the term distinguishes among all 'writers' only those who have cared to have their compositions published. Writing was not enough if one wanted to s'eriger en auteur; one's work also had to circulate in public by means of print. We find this relationship expressed in the late seventeenth century, but was it even older? One answer to the question comes from the first two catalogues of Frenchlanguage authors published in France, the Premier Volume de Ia Bibliotheque du Sieur de La Croix du Maine (1584) and La Bibliotheque d'Antoine du Verdier, seigneur de Vauprivas (1585). 26 The long subtitle of the Bibliotheque of La Croix du Maine is clearly organized on the basis of the category of the author: 'Which is a general catalogue of all sorts of authors who have written in French for five hundred years and more until this day: with a Discourse on the lives of the most illustrious and renowned among the three thousand who are included in this work, together with a relation of their compositions both printed and other.' The author-function already has its basic characteristics here. For one thing, La Croix du Maine makes authorship the first criterion of classification of works that have no other distribution than names in alphabetical order - or rather, in the medieval manner, of their author's first names, since the Bibliotheque runs from 'Abel 41

Figures of the Author
Foulon' to 'Yves Le Fortier', with a table of contents to aid retrieval of the authors on the basis of their last names. Further, in proposing 'lives' of the authors (which, incidentally, do not figure in volume one of the Bibliotheque, the only volume to have been published), La Croix du Maine sets up the writer's biography as the fundamental reference for writing. This primacy given to the author, defined as a real individual whose life can be related, is confirmed by Antoine Du Verdier, whose Bibliotheque 'containing the catalogue of all those who have written or translated in French and other Dialects of this Realm' excludes fictive authors: 'I have not wanted to put in it the Almanacs of various sorts that have been made annually under supposed names. Given even that correctors in printing establishments made them, for the most part, in the name of persons who never were.' The two Bibliotheques of La Croix du Maine and Du Verdier attest that the deployment of the author-function was not necessarily connected either with print publication or with the independence of the writer. Both of them, unlike Richelet and Furetiere in their definitions of a century later, consider that the manuscript makes the author just as much as the printed book. In fact, the two compilations announce in their titles that they will mention, for all authors, 'their compositions both printed and other' (La Croix du Maine) or 'all of their works printed and not printed' (Du Verdier). La Croix du Maine, justifying the usefulness of his catalogue as a means for preventing usurpers from publishing under their own name works remaining in manuscript at their true author's death, specifies, 'inasmuch as I have spoken of both printed works and those that are not yet in the light [en lumiere]'. At the end of the sixteenth century in France, if the category of the author constituted the basic
42

Figures of the Author
principle for classifying discourse, it did not obligatorily presuppose their mise en lumiere, that is, their existence in print. The author-function had no trouble harmonizing with the dependency instituted by patronage. In a dedication addressed to the king, La Croix du Maine mentions his two reasons for publishing the Premier Volume of his Bibliotheque. The first was to show the superiority of the Kingdom of France with its three thousand authors who had written in the vernacular, whereas the authors who had written or translated into Italian nun1bered no more than three hundred. 27 The second was 'to have the friendship of so many learned men who are living today of whom the greater part are employed in the service of your Majesty' (emphasis mine). The detail attests that the construction of the author-function was quite conceivable within the modalities that characterized the 'literary ancien regime'. Far from being contradictory, the patronage connection and the affirmation of the author together define the regime of assignation of texts. La Croix du Maine clearly expressed this when in 1579 he wrote of his Grande Bibliotheque Fran{oise, volume five of which, published five years later, was a simple Epitome. La Grande Bibliotheque Fran,oise, which was never printed, was not only to contain 'the catalogue of the works or writings of every author' but also indicated for all works 'by whom they were printed, in what format or size, in what years, how many sheets they contain, and especially the names of the men or women to whom they were dedicated, without omitting all their entire qualities' (emphasis mine). As on a title page, every work was thus referred to the names of three persons, the author, the dedicatee, and the bookseller or printer-publisher, reinforced by his mark. 28
43

Figures of the Author
The title page of the editio princeps of Don Quixote in 1605 illustrates this well. 29 At the top is the title in capital letters: EL INGENIOSO / HIDALGO DON QUI/ XOTE DE LA MANCHA. Underneath this, in italics, comes the essential assignment of the text, 'Compuesto por Miguel de Cervantes / Saavedra'. (This information is repeated in the preliminary materials along with the tasa indicating the price at which the book can be sold 'doscientos y noventa maravedfs y medio' - and the licencia, which accords the author a printing privilege for ten years.) Under the author's name, in roman letters, is the mention of the dedicatee with his titles in full: 'DIRIGIDO AL DUQUE DE BEIAR, / Marques de Gibraleon, Conde de Benalca~ar, y Baiia-fres, Vizconde de Ia Puebla de Alcozer, Senor de I las villas de Capilla, Curiel, y / Burguillos.' The upper third of the title page is thus given over to the fundamental relationship that dominated literary activity until the mid eighteenth century: the connecting of an author (already constituted as such) to a protector from whom he expected support and gratifications. The printer's mark, framed by the two elements of the date, 'Ano' and '1605', occupies the greater part of the remaining space. At the bottom there are three lines of text: 'CON PRIVILEGIO, / EN MADRID, Por Juan de Ia Cuesta. I Vendese en casa de Francisco de Robles, librero del Rey nro senor.' These provide the proper indications to satisfy the requirements of the book trade: mention of the privilege, the mark of royal authority, the place of publication and the name of the printer and, at the very bottom under a solid horizontal line, the address at which an eventual buyer could buy the work. The very construction of the visual space of the title page expresses several things that are less, contradictory

44

Figures of the Author
and earlier in date than is sometimes thought. The first is an affirmation of the author's literary paternity, recognized by the king who accords Cervantes the licencia y facultad to print or have printed a work 'that cost him great labour and is most useful and profitable'. The same paternity is displayed with irony by Cervantes in his prologue: 'Pero yo, que, aunque parezco padre, soy padrastro de don Quijote, no quiero irme con Ia corriente de uso, ni suplicarte casi con las lagrimas en los ojos, como otros hacen, lector carfsimo, que perdones o disimules las faltas que en este mi hijo vieres' (But I, though in appearance Don Quixote's father, am really his stepfather, and so will not drift with the current of custom, nor implore you, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do, dearest reader, to ~ardon or ignore the faults you see in this child of mine). 0 The play on the words padre and padrastro is a way to prefigure the fiction introduced in chapter 9, the first chapter in the 'Segunda Parte' of the 1605 Quixote, in which the narrative offered the reader is in fact a translation into Castilian done 'en poco mas de mes y medio' {in little more than six weeks) by a Morisco from Toledo of a manuscript in Arabic, the Historia de don

Quijote de Ia Mancha, escrita por Cide Hamete Benengeli, historiador ardbigo. 31 Neither the theme of the text encountered by chance (in this case, found amid the 'cartapacios y papeles viejos' - 'parchments and old papers' -sold by a lad to a silk merchant) nor that of the pre-existent work of which the published book simply offers a copy or a translation is used here to disguise the real author. The 'authors' of the novel multiply: there is the 'I' of the prologue who announces that the work is his; then there is the author of the eight first chapters who upsets the '1-reader' inscribed in the text when he suddenly interrupts his narration ('This caused me great annoyance'); 45

Figures of the Author
there is also the author of the Arabic manuscript; finally, there is the Morisco author of the translation that is the text read by the '1-reader' and by the reader of the novel. What this break-up of the author does, however, is to manifest the figure of the author in its primordial function of guaranteeing the unity and the coherence of the discourse. The title page of Don Quixote is equally unambiguous in its presentations of patronage (with the dedication to the duke of Bejar) and the market (with the mention of the printer, Juan de Ia Cuesta, to whom Cervantes had ceded the licenda y facultad to print his book accorded to the author by a royal cedula dated 26 September 1604). The author's desire to participate in market logic and to have control over the sale of his works to a bookseller or a printer who will publish them is totally compatible with an acceptance of or a search for patronage. One example of this (among others) in Elizabethan England is the case of Ben ] onson. ] onson affirmed (and exercised) the author's right to sell his works directly to a publisher, contradicting a long-standing custom that granted theatrical companies an exclusive right to have copied or printed the manuscripts of the plays they put on. Thus he seized control of his own texts in view of publication (as for the edition of the Workes of Benjamin Jonson published by William Stansby in 1616). Ben ] onson also counts among the first English authors who dedicated their published plays to aristocratic patrons: The Masque of Queenes was dedicated to Prince Henry in 1609, Catiline to the Count of Pembroke in 1611, and The Alchemist to Mary Wroth in 1612. Patronage and the market were thus not mutually exclusive, and all authors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries faced the same need as Ben Jonson: to adapt 'the modern

46

Figures

technology of dissemination to an archaic patronage economy'. 32 Contracts between authors and booksellers confirm this dovetailing of the rules of commerce and the need for protection. In the thirty or so contracts that Annie Parent-Charron has found for Paris in the years 1535-60 the commonest case has the bookseller taking responsibility for all the printing costs and for obtaining the privilege and the author receiving as rentuneration free copies of the book ranging in number frotn twenty-five copies for the translation of Livy's Decades by Jean de Amelin published by Guillaume Cavellat (in a contract dated 6 August 1658) to one hundred copies for the Epithome de Ia vraye astrologie et de Ia reprovee of David Finarensis printed by Etienne Groulleau (contract dated 22 August 1547). A monetary remuneration added to the free copies from the bookseller appears only in two situations, when the author obtained the privilege and paid the chancery fees, and when the contract covers a translation, especially in the years 1550-60 for the Castilian chivalric romances that were all the rage. Even in that case, the consignment of copies that could be offered to the king or to grandees (actual or potential patrons) remained the most important element. Proof of this is a clause in the contract dated 19 November 1540 between Nicolas de Herberay and the Paris booksellers Jean Longis and Vicent Sertenas for Herberay's translation of the second, third, and fourth parts of Amadis de Gaule. For his labours and for the privilege that Herberay himself had obtained, he received not only 80 ecus d'or soleil and twelve copies of each book en blanc en volume de Jeuille (in unbound sheets) but also an exclusive right to distribute the book for a limited time: the contract states that booksellers 'can distribute or sell any of the

47

Figures of the Author
said three volumes only after they have first been presented by the said Herberay to the King our Lord, on pain of all expenses and damages and interests, which he promises to present six weeks after the said fourth volume will have been delivered to him printed in sheets as stated' - a delay that would give the author time to have the presentation copies properly bound. 33 The traditional system of patronage, far from being dismantled by the diffusion of the printed book, adapted to the new technique for the reproduction of texts and to the market logic that it set up. This is true for the Renaissance, and it was probably still partially true in the eighteenth century, at the time of the first 'professionalization' of authors who were eager and at times capable of living {not necessarily well) by their pens. As Robert Damton has shown in his analysis of the list of writers kept under surveillance by Inspector of Police d'Hemery between 1748 and 17 53 and the survey of gens de lettres published in La France litteraire in 1784, the two ancient models for the author's condition remained dominant: the writer either enjoyed an economic independence assured by birth or profession or lived on gratifications and sinecures procured from patronage. 34 The new phenomenon of a social status founded solely on the remuneration of writing emerged only with difficulty within the mental framework of the ancien regime, a situation expressed by Voltaire in his diatribes against 'the miserable species that writes for a living'. Freedom (of ideas or of commerce) seemed in no way contradictory to the protection of authority, beginning with the protection of the king, dispenser of positions and favours. Since the emergence of the author-function is less directly connected to the definition of the concept of literary property than might be thought, must it then be

48

Figures of the Author
attached to 'penal appropriation' of discourses? To the writer's judicial responsibility? Or, as Foucault writes, to 'the danger of writing' when writing had become subject to criminal prosecution?35 Answering this question and exploring the complex and multiple relations between state and church censorship and the construction of the figure of the author is far beyond the scope of the present study. Let me cite one example, though. In France after 1544 catalogues of the books that had been censored by the Faculty of Theology of Paris began to be published. In all editions of this catalogue {1544, 1545, 1547, 1551, 1556) titles are arranged in the same manner, 'secundum ordinem alphabeticum juxta authorurn cognomina'. The Sorbonne's Index used the category of the author as its fundamental principle for designating books in its lists of Latin works and French works. The 1544 catalogue begins with the rubrics 'Ex libris Andreae Althameri', 'Ex libris Martini Buceri', and so forth, maintaining its reference to the author even for anonymous books, which are enumerated under the titles 'Catalogus librorum quorum incerti sunt authores' {for Latin titles) and 'Catalogus librorum gallicorum ab incertis authoribus' (for French works). 36 In parallel fashion, the author's responsibility was introduced into royal legislation for controlling the printing, distribution, and sale of books. The edict of Chateaubriant of 27 June 1551, which marked the apogee of the collaboration between the king, the Parlement, and the Sorbonne regarding censorship, states in its article 8:
It is forbidden to all printers to perform the exercise and status of impression except in good cities and orderly establishments accustomed to do this, not in secret places. And it must be under a master printer whose name,

49

Figures

domicile, and mark are put in the books thus printed by them [with] the time of the said impression and the name of the author (emphasis mine]. The which master printer will answer to faults and errors that either by him or under his name and by his order will have been made and committed. The author-function was thus constituted as an essential weapon in the battle against the diffusion of texts suspected of heterodoxy. In the repression of suspect books, however, the responsibility of the author of a censured book does not seem to have been considered any greater than that of the printer who published it, the bookseller or the pedlar who sold it, or the reader who possessed it. All could be led to the stake if they were convicted of having proffered or diffused heretical opinions. What is more, the acts of conviction often mix accusations concerning the printing and ,sale of censured books and accusations concerning the opinions - published or unpublished- of the perpetrator. This is what happened to Antoine Augereau, a type engraver who had become a printer, who was strangled and his body burned in the Place Maubert on 24 December 1534. The details of his sentence are not known but the chroniclers of the time explain the event by insisting on two points. First, they stress Augereau's printing activities (he was supposedly sentenced for having been an 'ally of bill-posters [of placards against the mass posted up during the night of 17-18 October 1534] and for having printed false books' as well as for having 'printed and sold books of Luther's'). Second, they insist on his heterodox opinions. One chronicle brands Augereau as 'Lutheran', and the judgement of the Parlement refusing him the

50

Figures of the Author
privilege of being tried before an ecclesiastical court (he was a cleric) specifies that he was 'charged with having said and proffered several erroneous, blasphemous, and scandalous pro.Positions [the orig.inal. has grepositi~ns] against holy doctnne and the Catholic fatth'. 3 Thus tt was as an 'author' of heretical opinions as much as it was for his activities as a printer that Antoine Augereau was burned at the stake. Similarly, the accusations levelled against Etienne Dolet, a hutnanist who had become a printer, by the Sorbonne in 1543 mention not only the books that Dolet had printed or that merely were found in his house but also those that he had written or for which he had written a preface. 38 After the respite granted him by his abjuration on 13 November 1543, it was on the same charges {for having printed and sold prohibited books, having written unorthodox prefaces to several books) that Dolet was strangled and his body burned on 3 August on the Place Maubert, along with the censured books. 39 In its connection with church or state censorship as in its association with literary property, the author-function is fully inscribed within the culture of print. In both cases it appears to derive from fundamental transformations brought by printing: it was printing that extended, hence that made more dangerous, the circulation of texts that defied authority, and printing created a market that presupposed the establishment of rules and conventions among all who profited from it, economically or symbolically, the writer, the bookseller-publisher, and the printer. But was this really the case? Perhaps not, if we acknowledge that the essential traits in the book that manifest the assignation of the text to a particular individual designated as its author do not make their first appearance with printed works but were already typical of the manuscript book at the end of its unchallenged reign. 51

Figures of the Author
The most spectacular of those traits is the physical representation of the author in his book. The portrait of the author, which makes the assignation of the text to a single 'I' immediately visible, is frequent in printed books of the sixteenth century. 40 Whether or not the image endows the author (or the translator) with real or symbolic attributes of his (or her) art, whether presented in heroic classical style or 'from life', in natural appearance, the function of the author's portrait is to reinforce the notion that the writing is the expression of an individuality that gives authenticity to the work. However, representations of the author - and often of the author shown in the act of writing - appear in miniatures decorating manuscripts in the vernacular of the late fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries. This is true of works of Christine de Pisan, Jean Froissart, and Rene d'Anjou, and of Petrarch and Boccaccio. Portraits of the sort were novelties in two ways. First, at a time when the French words escrire and escripvain took on their modern meanings to indicate not only the copying but also the composition of texts, such portraits show an autograph writing that no longer presupposes dictation to a secretary. Second, they transfer to contemporary authors who wrote in the vulgar tongue the theme, frequent since the early fourteenth century in Latin texts, of writing as individual invention and original creation. The new image broke with time-honoured conventions in representations of the process of writing, both the convention that equated writing with listening to a dictated text and copying it (for example in the traditional iconography of the Evangelists and the Fathers of the church figured as scribes of the Divine Word) and the convention that thought of writing as a simple continuation of an existing work (as in the

case of the scholastic practice of the gloss and the commentary). 41 That first and manifest form of the presence of the author in the book was accompanied by another less visible to the reader, which is the control exercised by the writer over the form of publication of the text. The edition of Congreve's Works published by Jacob Tonson in London in 1710 is emblematic of the author's intervention in the process of publishing his works. As we have seen in chapter 1, on the occasion of this octavo edition of his plays, which until then had been printed separately in a quarto format, Congreve gave new form to his texts, dividing them into scenes where they had been lacking and providing more stage directions with his dialogue. These innovations were reflected in the way in which the plays were printed by means of numbers for scenes, print ornaments placed between one scene and the next, a mention of the characters present given at the beginning of each scene, indications in the margin of who was speaking, and the notation of exits and entrances. These formal mechanisms, which were borrowed from French published theatrical works, gave a new status to the works, and that fact in tum led Congreve to prune his text of a few details that he considered contrary to the dignity of this new presentation. 42 Contracts between printers and authors are another proof of the control that authors expected to exercise over the publication of their works. If sixteenth-century Paris can serve as an example, an author, as one might expect, had every reason to be demanding when he had a work printed and sold it himself, either directly or through a bookseller. Thus on 11 May 1559 Charles Perier, a merchant-bookseller and printer, promised a representative of the bishop of Laon, Jean Doc,

53

Figures

of the Author

to print and have printed, well and duly, as should be done, six volumes of the Homelies des dimanches et Jestes de /'annee in the same letters and similar characters that the said Perier used formerly for the said Reverend gentleman [an allusion to other books printed by Perier for Jean Doc], and to do so in quarto volumes, and to adjust the annotations in it as they will be delivered to him.

Concern for the form of the book can also be seen when an author gave over his manuscript to a bookseller in exchange for free copies of the work and, at times, monetary remuneration. On 22 August 1547, when he contracted to print the Epithome of David Finarensis, Etienne Groulleau declared that he would respect 'the state in which he [Finarensis] wishes it to be printed, in the French language and with the type used in a piece of printed paper that he left in the hands of the said Finarensis, signed by the subscribed notaries, ne varietur'; on 29 November .1556 Ambroise de La Porte promised to print 'well and duly' a work of Andre Thevet entitled Les singularitez de Ia France antarctique and to 'have engraved figures in such terms as shall be agreed to between the said Thevet, de La Porte, and master Bernard de Poiseulne (the engraver]'; finally, on 3 April 1559 Frederic Morel rece~ved several works composed or translated by Louis Le Roy, 'all to be printed correctly in handsome characters and [on] good paper, in large roman or italic letters'. 43 These agreements, which mention the typeface, the paper, the plates, and at times the format, attest clearly the authors' intention to establish their control over the way their texts were to circulate. This intention was not born with print. In order to prevent his works from being corrupted by a division of labour between author and copyist so strict that he 'would
54

Figures of the Author
no longer be able to recognize the texts he composed', Petrarch proposed another formula that would guarantee the author's domination of the production and transmission of the text. The 'author's book', produced from an autograph copy (not a scribe's copy), designed for limited circulation, and protected from the faulty copying of professional copyists, would manifest the author's intentions as the work had been composed with less risk of betraying those intentions or vitiating them. Controlled and stabilized in this manner, the text was to institute a direct and authentic relation between the author and the reader because, as Armando Petrucci tells us, 'perfect textuality, a direct emanation from the author validated by his autograph writing, was (and forever remained) a guarantee of absolute readability for the reader.' 44 Even though Petrarch's programme and his practice (he copied several of his own works in his own hand) remained out of the mainstream of the economy of production of the manuscript of his tirne, they none the less reflect an early emergence, in the fourteenth century, of one of the major expressions of the author-function, the possibility of deciphering in the forms of a book the intention that lay behind the creation of the text. The more immediate and more material manifestation of the assignation of discourses to an author lies in the unity between a work and an object, between a textual unit and a codicological unit. This was long not true of works in the vulgar tongue. The don1inant form of the manuscript book was, in fact, that of the notarial register or, in Italy, the libro-zibaldone. Such unadorned, small or medium-sized books, written in a cursive hand, were copied by their own readers, who put in them, in no apparent order, texts of quite different sorts in prose and in verse, devotional and technical, documentary and

55

Figures of the Author
poetic. These compilations, produced by lay people unfamiliar with the traditional institutions of manuscript production and for whom the act of copying was a necessary preliminary to reading, characteristically show no sign of the author-function. The unity of such a book comes from the fact that its producer is also its addressee. 45 Even beyond this new public made up by readers who are not professionals of written culture (officials, notaries, secretaries), the form of the compilation, which was shared by a number of genres (exempla, sententiae, proverbs, fables, tales, lyric poetry, and so forth) helped to minimize assigning works to an individual. Thus among the three types of collections of lyric poetry of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries discerned by Jacqueline Cerquiglini, only one (the one in which a poet gathers together his or her works) is fully qualifiable as displaying the author-function. The two other types (a collection of several poets' works in the form of an album and a collection in the form of an anthology) either present the texts anonymously or, when the authors' names are rubricated, construct the book's unity on the basis of the principle of a literary game played within a circle of friends or at a princely court that is a far cry from an individualized work. 46 None the less, even before the age of the printed book (which incidentally prolonged the tradition of composite collections in a number of genres}, the connection between a codicological unit and a textual unit ascribed to an author in his full singularity became true of certain works in the vulgar tongue. This was the case, for example, with Petrarch. A precise study shows how one of his major vernacular works, I trionfi, was transmitted in the manuscript tradition during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. 47 The first thing we note 56

Figures of the Author
is that the manuscripts containing only texts by Petrarch (either only I trionfi or I trionfi along with the Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta and/or other works) account for 62 per cent of the 424 manuscripts surveyed, whereas those in which Petrarch's text figures with the works of other authors represent 37 per cent of total books surveyed. Thus it is clear that during the last centuries . of the hand-copied book, although a strong relationship existed between the book as an object and the author as a guarantee of the book's coherence, there were still signs, even with an author such as Petrarch, of the practice of the collection of works of mixed authorship. The second thing to note is that the author's singularity won out over the singularity of the wo~k. In fact, the manuscripts that include only I trionfi represent 25 per cent of this total corpus, as against 37 per cent for those that combine two or several works by Petrarch (including his letters). The modern notion of 'book', which spontaneously associates an object and a work, although not unknown in the Middle Ages, separated off only slowly from the collection of several texts by a given author. A final remark: between the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries the author-function clearly progresses in the identity of the book. Whereas in the 79 manuscripts in this corpus that come from the first half of the fourteenth century there is a nearly even balance between manuscripts containing only works by Petrarch and others mixing Petrarch's works with those of other authors (53 per cent and 46 per cent), the gap increases later in favour of manuscripts by Petrarch alone (63 per cent against 37 per cent) in the 248 manuscripts of the latter half of the fourteenth century, and 7 4 per cent against 26 per cent in the 78 manuscripts dating from the fifteenth century.

Foucault was right to recognize a presence of the author in the Middle Ages, when texts circulated in manuscript, but his hypothesis that authorship as a function for the classification of discourses was attached to medieval 'scientific' texts while 'literary' works fell under the rule of anonymity seems somewhat more fragile. In reality, a basic distinction must be made between the ancient texts - whatever their genre - that founded their authority on the work's attribution to a name (not only Pliny or Hippocrates, whom Foucault mentions, but also Aristotle and Cicero, St Jerome and St Augustine, Albert the Great and Vincent of Beauvais) and works in the vulgar tongue for which the author-function was constituted around a few great 'literary' figures - in Italy, Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. In this sense, the trajectory of the author can be thought of as a gradual change in the way texts in the vernacular were regarded, attributing to them a principle of designation and election that had long been characteristic only of works that were referred to an ancient auctoritas and that had become part of a corpus of works continually cited and tirelessly commented upon. By the same token, the radical reversal in the seventeenth or eighteenth century between the abandonment of the author-function among scientific texts and the demand for an author-function in poetic and fictional texts becomes somewhat less clear. If by twisting the rule of individual attribution of literary works the various games played with the author's name (dissimulation, disguise, usurpation) in reality confirmed the rule of the individual attribution of literary works, 48 it is less certain that a rule of anonymity commanded the production of scientific statements. For a notable length of time the validation of an experience or the accreditation of a

58

Figures of the Author
proposition presupposed the guarantee provided by a proper name - the proper names of those who, by their position in society, had the power to proclaim the truth. 49 The fact that scholars and practitioners disappeared behind aristocratic authority in no way resulted in the anonymity of a discourse whose authenticity was not exclusively dependent on its compatibility with an already constituted body of knowledge. During the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries a number of scientific texts displayed a characteristic that Foucault (perhaps wrongly) reserved to medieval works alone: later scientific texts were also 'accepted ... and accepted as "true," only when marked with the name of their author' - an 'author', however, who was long understood as someone whose social position could lend 'authority' to intellectual discourse. 'What is an author?' The few reflections presented here are not intended as an answer to the question. All they hope to do is to stress that the history of the book, in all its various dimensions, can have some pertinence to the problem. It would be a mistake to reduce the construction of an author-function, understood as the major criterion for the attribution of texts, to oversimplified or toounivocal formulas. Nor can that construction be pinned down to one determining cause or a unique historical moment. The present text, which examines three sets of mechanisms - juridical, repressive, 50 and material fundamental for the invention of the 'author', simply aims at staking out an area for possible future study. The author-function, inscribed in the books themselves, ordering all attempts to establish textual classifications commanding the rules for the publication of texts, is henceforth at the centre of all questions linking the study of the production, forms, and readers of texts.

This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, although vast, is not infinite): in other words, all that it is given to express, in all languages. Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogue of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of all books in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books. When it was proclaimed that

Libraries without Walls
the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. 1

'When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness.' The dream of a library ( in a variety of configurations) that would bring together all accumulated knowledge and all the books ever written can be found throughout the history of Western civilization. It underlay the constitution of great princely, ecclesiastical, and private 'libraries'; it justified a tenacious search for rare books, lost editions, and texts that had disappeared; it commanded architectural projects to construct edifices · capable of welcoming the world's memory. In 1785 Etienne-Louis Boullee proposed a project for the reconstruction of the Bibliotheque du Roi. 2 The architect's guiding idea was to cover the long ( 100 x 30 metres) interior court between the existing buildings with a barrel vault, thus making a reading room that would be the largest in all Europe. Along the sides of this 'immense basilica' lighted by a skylight at the top of the vault there were to be four stepped tiers lined with bookshelves, the uppermost of which provided a base for a colonnade. The colonnade was to be continued at either end of the room to form something like a 'triumphal arch' with the curve of the vault 'under which two allegorical statues coJld be put'. The works shelved in this reading room were to be placed within easy reach for readers who strolled before them, or they could be obtained by means of a human chain of 'persons placed on various levels and distributed so as to pass the books from hand to hand'. In the perspective view that accompanied the Memoire describing the project and in Boullee's presentation model tiny figures of readers draped in Roman togas are visible

62

Libraries without Walls
(one can count forty-four of them). They are walking among the books accumulated there; they pause, standing, to read a book, or they group around the few tables placed in the hall. The message is clear: a space in the form of a basilica and devoted to reading recuperates a sacred character that ecclesiastical buildings had lost; study is like a voyage among books punctuated by advances and halts, by solitary reading, and by erudite conversation. The acknowledged model for Boullee's representation. of his reading room is Raphael's School of Athens, but there are important difference between the two depictions. In the fresco in the Stanza della Segnatura there are few books, and the few that are shown are in the hands of the person who composed or copied them; in Boullee's drawing the thousands of books of the Bibliotheque du Roi constitute a universal body of knowledge that has been conserved and reduced to a thesaurus. Similarly, in Boullee's vision, the perspective is no longer structured to present an open porch, a human presence, and the power of creative discourse (that of Plato and of Aristotle surrounded by their disciples); rather it converges towards a door that marks the threshold between the profane world of the ignorant and the world of learning's elect and towards an allegorical statue in the classical mode, a symbol of the heritage that must be brought together and mastered before new thoughts are conceivable. Bringing together the entire written patrimony of humanity in one place proves an impossible task, though. When print produced a proliferation of titles and editions, it ruined all hope for an exhaustive collection. Even for those who held that a library must be encyclopedic, selection was an absolute necessity. This was true for Gabriel Naude in his Advis pour dresser une Bibliotheque, written in 1627 and addressed to Henri de Mesmes,

63

Libraries without Walls president at the Parlement de Paris and a great book collector. 3 Against the model of the cabinet curieux or the cabinet choisi reserved to the delectation of their proprietor and gathering together a small number of books distinguished for their rarity or their luxury, N aude pleads for a well-furnished library: 'It is much more useful and necessary to have, for example, a great quantity of books well bound in the ordinary fashion than to fill only some small, pale, gilded, and decorous room or cabinet enriched with all manner of little oddities [mrgnardise], luxuries, and superfluities.' 4 A library is not built to satisfy egotistical enjoyments but because there is 'no more honest and assured means for acquiring a great renown among the peoples than to erect handsome and magnificent Libraries in order then to dedicate and consecrate them to the use of the public'. 5 This noble design had a corollary:
This is why I will always esteem that it is most appropriate to gather to that effect all sorts of Books (subject to the few precautions, however, that I shall state below), since a Library arranged for the use of the public must be universal, and it cannot be so if it does not contain all the principal Authors who have written on the great diversity of particular subjects. 6 Ideally made up of an 'infinity of good, singular, and remarkable' works, the library must none the less limit its ambitions and make choices: Still, in order not to leave this quantity infinite by not defining it, and also in order not to throw the curious out of all hope of being able to accomplish and come to the end of this handsome enterprise, it seems to me that it is appropriate to do as the Physicians do, who order the quantity of drugs according to their quality, and to say

64

Libraries without Walls
that one cannot lack gathering all those (books] that have the qualities and conditions required for being put in a Library. 7 Naude's Advis thus functons to guide the collector as he makes necessary selections and takes the appropriate 'precautions', since Naude indicates the authors and the works absolutely indispensable for his library. The division between the books that one absolutely must possess and those that might (or must) be left aside is only one of the ways to mitigate the problem of the impossibility of a universal library. There were other ways, which the language of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries indicated with the very term defining the place in which the books were kept: bibliotheque. In the entry for that word in Furetiere's Dictionnaire (1690) the first definition is the most traditional meaning: 'Bibliotheque: Apartment or place destined for putting books; gallery, building full of books. Also said in general of the books that are placed in this vessel.' Next comes a second meaning designating a book rather than a place: 'Bibliotheque is also a Collection, a Compilation of several works of the same nature or of Authors who have compiled all that can be [compiled] on the same subject.' In his Advis N aude praises the many merits of the collections that constitute as many 'libraries' in one work: In the first place, they save us the trouble of seeking out an infinite number of highly rare and curious books; secondly, because they leave space for many others and give relief to a Library; thirdly, because they condense for us in one volume and commodiously what we would have to seek with much trouble in several places; and finally,

65

Libraries without Walls
because they bring with them a great saving, being certain that it requires fewer testons [coins worth ten sous] to buy them than it would require ecus if one wanted to have separately all the [works] that they contain. 8 The Latin terms for a collection vary considerably in these titles: thesaurus, corpus, catalogus, Jlores, and so forth. In French the genre was usually qualified as a bibliotheque. Four years after the publication of Furetiere's Dictionnaire, the Dictionnaire of the Academie Fran~aise bore witness to this preference: 'One also calls Bibliotheques Collections and Compilations of works of like nature.' Three examples follow the definition: 'La Bibliotheque des Peres, La Nouvelle Bibliotheque des Peres, La Bibliotheque du Droit Fran,ois.' Eighteenth-century bookseller-publishers published great numbers of these multiple-volume collections gathering together published works in a given genre such as novels, tales, or travel accounts. Not all such collections bore the name bibliotheque. For example, there was the sixteen-volume Histoire generale des voyages of Abbe Prevost covering the years from 17 46 to 17 61, published first in quarto format and later, between 1746 and 1789, in eighty duodecimo volumes; there were two publications put out by Charles Gamier, the Cabinet des fees (1785-9), forty-one volumes in octavo format, and the Voyages imaginaires, songes, visions et romans cabalistiques (1787-9), in thirty-nine octavo sized volumes. Many collections, however, made use of both the formula and the term inaugurated by the Amsterdam periodicals of Jean Le Clerc, the Bibliotheque universelle et historique (1686-93), the Bibliotheque choisie (1703-13), and the Bibliotheque ancienne et moderne: Pour servir de suite aux Bibliotheques universelle et choisie (1714-27}. In all, there were thirty-one

66

Libraries without Walls
periodical publications in the French language, some of which lasted longer than others, that were offered under the title of bibliotheque between 1686 and 1789. 9 The term was used throughout the century, with seventeen titles published before 1750 and fourteen after. Several of these publications were not periodicals, properly speaking, but imposing collections of texts related by their genre or their targeted audience. One such was the Bibliotheque universelle des romans (Paris, 177 5-89, 224 volumes in duodecimo format), which was presented as a 'periodical work in which is given the reasoned analysis of Novels ancient and modern, French or translated into our language', which published extracts and summaries, historical and critical notes, unabridged texts of novels, and tales both ancient and original. 10 Another was the Bibliotheque universelle des dames (Paris, 1785-97, 156 octodecimosized volumes), which had encyclopedic atnbitions, given that it contained travel narratives, novels, and works of history, morality, n1athematics and astronomy, physics and natural history, and all the liberal arts. These imposing 'libraries', along with the encyclopedias and the dictionaries, constituted a major part of the great publishing ventures of the eighteenth century. As Louis-Sebastien Mercier noted, they guaranteed the diffusion of knowledge- or at least of literary pleasure- and they provided a living for a multitude of the people who were scornfully called demi-litterateurs or ecrivailleurs. As Mercier put it:
Panckoucke and Vincent commision [dictionaries] frotn any compiler armed with scribes; volumes are built by the alphabet just as an edifice is constructed in the space of so many months. The [success of the] work is sure thanks to maneuvers. Everything has been put in dictionaries. The

67

Libraries without Walls
scholars complain: they are wrong. Must not sctence descend to all conditions? 11

The 'libraries', which aimed at being exhaustive and universal in any given genre or domain, had a counterpoint in the eighteenth century in a vast number of equally popular small, concise, and easily handled volumes named extraits, esprits, abreges, analyses, and so forth. 12 The smaller, portable anthologies were another form of 'library' produced by the book trade. Even if both genres offered extracts, their intention was not the same. The smaller works aimed at eliminating, selecting, and reducing rather than accumulating a multitude of separate and dispersed works in one collection (periodical or not). If the way in which collections in the form of a bibliotheque were constructed aimed at accomplishing as best one could the impossible task of gathering together for every reader all the books concerning a particular sphere, an appeal to analysis and esprit implied that such a task was useless or harmful, and that the necessary knowledge, available in a small number of works, needed to be concentrated or distilled like a chemical substance. In that belief they agreed with the utopias of the century that rejected the encyclopedic libraries as over-encumbered and superfluous and permitted only a very few books in their ideal library. In his utopia {more accurately, his uchronia) of 1771, L'An 2440, Louis-Sebastien Mercier pays a visit to the library of the king and finds it to be son1ewhat singular: 'In place of those four galleries of immense length, which contained many thousands of volumes, I could find only one small cabinet, in which were several books that seemed to me far from voluminous.' Intrigued, Mercier asks the librarian what has happened, and the librarian
68

Libraries without Walls
answers that before burning all the books judged to be 'either frivolous or useless or dangerous', the enlightened men of the twenty-fifth century saved the essential, which took up little room:
As we are neither unjust nor like the Saracens, who heated their baths with masterworks, we made a choice: wise men extracted the .substance from a thousand in-folio volumes, all of which they transferred into a small duodecimo-sized volume, somewhat in the same way that the skilful chemists who extract the virtue from plants concentrate it in a flask and throw out the vulgar liquors. We have abridged what seemed of most importance; the best have been reprinted; and all the whole corrected according to the true principles of morality. Our compilers are estimable people and dear to the nation; they ·had taste, and as they were in a creative frame of mind, they were able to choose what was excellent and reject what was not. 13

The tension between comprehensiveness and essence thus ordered the complex and contradictory relations between the library in its usual spatial and architectural sense and print genres (only some of which were called bibliotheques) - relationships that assigned to the 'library' as a book, be it one volume or one of a series, the functions of accumulation or of selection attributed to the place. 14 But a library was not only a place or a collection. Furetiere's Dictionnaire proposes a third definition of the term (not found in the more concise entry of the Dictionnaire of the Academie): 'One also calls Bibliotheque the books that contain the Catalogues of the books in the Bibliotheques. Gesner, Possevin, Photius, have made Bibliotheques. . . . Father Labbe, a Jesuit, has made the Bibliotheque des Bibliotheques in an octavo-sized book that 69

Libraries without Walls
contains only the catalogue of the names of those who have written Bibliotheques. ' 15 For anyone who might wish to design an open and universal library, the possession of such catalogues was a necessity. The sum of their titles defined an ideal library freed from the constraints imposed by any one actual collection and overflowing the limits inherent in anthologies and compilations by the immaterial construction of a sort of library of all libraries in which nothing (or almost nothing) was lacking. N aude tells his interlocutor that the accumulation and copying of catalogues of libraries is obligatory: 'One must not omit nor neglect to have transcribed all the Catalogues, not only of the great and renowned Libraries, ancient or modem, public or private, in the possession of our compatriots or of foreigners, but also the Studies and Cabinets that for not being known or frequented remain buried in a perpetual silence.' Naude gives as one of his reasons for this requirement: 'It is to do pleasure and service to a friend, when one cannot furnish him with the book he lacks, to show and designate to him the place where he truly can find a copy of it, as one can easily do by means of these Catalogues.' 16 Thanks to the circulation of the catalogues, the closed world of individual libraries could be transformed into an infinite universe of books noted, reviewed, visited, consulted and, eventually, borrowed. Furetiere's definition slips from catalogues of particular holdings towards another sort of work. A 'library' is not only the inventory of the books assembled in a specific place; it can be an inventory of all the books ever written on a given subject or by all the authors of a given nation. Thus Furetiere notes: 'In France, there is not yet a general Bibliotheque of all the Authors. There are particular ones by the Sieur La Croix du Maine Manceau and Anthoine 70

Libraries without Walls
Du Verdier. Spain has one by Nicolas Anthonio. There is also a Bibliotheque d'Espagne of Peregrinus, and the Bibliotheque des Escrivains Espagnols by Andre Schot in 1608.' 17 Thus the genre that the Dictionnaire evokes and designates with the term bibliotheque is defined according to two criteria: it lists authors; it respects the national framework (France, Spain). At the end of the seventeenth century such 'libraries' already had a long history. 18 Three such works had appeared before 1550, the Cathalogus illustrium virorum Germaniae suis ingeniis et lucubrationibus omnifariam exornantium of Johann Tritheim (Mainz, 1495), the Bibliotheca Universalis, sive Catalogus omnium scriptorum locupletissimus, in tribus linguis, Latina, Graeca, et Hebraica of Conrad Gesner (Zurich, 1545), and the Illustrium Maioris Britanniae Scriptorum of John Bale (Ipswich, 1548). These three works have several traits in common: they are written in Latin, they list for the most part ancient authors, and they privilege works written in the classical languages. Beyond these similarities, their choices varied. First, as to the framework chosen: a national territory (Germania for Tritheim and Great Britain for Bale, who restricts the scope of his work in its full title: Illustrium Maioris Britanniae Scriptorum, Hoc Est Angliae, Cambriae, ac Scotiae Summarium); the whole of humanity for Gesner. Next, as to the name of the work: Tritheim and Bale (in a new edition of his work in 1557) use the tern1 catalogus, but Gesner innovates, launching a new usage of bibliotheca that detaches the word from its material definition and invests the library without walls proposed in his book with universality. Finally, the three works differ in their organization: Tritheim and Bale chose a chronological structure (the latter specifying in quasdam centurias divisum cum diversitate doctrinarum atque; annorum recta supputatione 71

Libraries without Walls per omnes aetates a Iapheto sanctissimi Noah filio, ad annum domini M.D. XLVIII), providing an alphabetical index to make the work easier to consult. Once again Gesner stands alone, opting for alphabetical order but in the medieval style (unlike Tritheim and Bale) and classifying his authors by their baptismal names - that is, their first names. The declared universality of his Bibliotheca presupposes an exhaustive survey that retains ancients and contemporaries, printed texts and manuscript texts, learned authors and less learned authors. The long title justifies the dual usefulness of the book - Opus novum, et non Bibliothecis tantum publicis privatisque instituendis necessarium, sed studiosis omnibus cuiuscunque artis aut scientiae ad studia me/ius formanda utilissimum - after having declared its content - Catalogus omnium scriptorum locupletissimus, in tribus Unguis, Latina, Graeca, et Hebraica: extantium et non extantium, veterum et recentiorum in hunc usque diem, doctorum et non doctorum, publicatorum et in Bibliothecis latentium. 19 When Anton Francesco Doni published his Libra ria ... Nella quale so no scritti tutti gl'Au tori vulgari con cento discorsi sopra quelli: Tutte le tradutioni Jatte dell'altre lingue, nella nostra e una tavola genera/mente come si costuma Jra Librari (Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, Venice, 1550), he inaugurated a new mode of presentation in this genre. 20 He innovated in three ways: first, in language, since the Libraria reviewed only authors or translators in the vernacular and is itself written in the vulgar tongue. Next, the intention of the book was new: it contains no inventory of all authors, no collection of judgements; rather, it is primarily designed to provide information on titles available in the vernacular: 'I have made this library only to give knowledge of all the books printed in the vulgar language so that people who like to read in our

72

Libraries without Walls
language may know how many works have been published and what [they are], not to judge which are good and which bad.' The third novelty lay in the work's format. Doni abandons large formats (the quarto of Tritheim and Bale, the in-folio of Gesner) to publish his Libraria in a more manageable duodecimo format that the reader who haunted the bookshops in search of the titles that this ideal library (again, without walls) might suggest could easily carry. The small volume of the Libraria published in 1550 had 144 pages, and it mentioned 159 authors, arranged in alphabetical order by their first names (from Acarisio da Cento to Vincenzo Rinchiera). Doni plays learned games with the fourteen letters of the alphabet around which his nomenclature is organized. The initial of the given name of the authors listed in a section was also the initial of the given name of the dedicatee mentioned in a preamble heading the section, as well as the initial of the first word in that brief text (for example, the 'A' section was headed, -'Abate Abati. Assai son 1'opere . . . '). After this list of all the authors who had published in the vulgar tongue, Doni provides three other lists: a typology of vernacular genres ('Humanita I Dialoghi I Comedie I Rime I Lettere I Romanzi I Storie'), an inventory of texts translated from Latin into Italian (arranged according to another system as 'Sacra Scrittura et Spirituali I Historie I Epistole tradotte I Comedie Tragedie I Medicina'), and a 'Tavola Generate di tutti libri volgari' in the form of a bookseller's catlogue but without bibliographic information on specific editions. A year after this first book Doni published La Seconda Libraria listing texts that had not yet been printed. The principle in this work was the same as in the first, with an alphabetical inventory from Acarisio da Cento to Zanobi
73

Libraries without Walls
Fiorentino and with a similar game of correspondences between the letter of the alphabet pertaining to each section and the initial letter of the first word of the brief tales or apologues that opened each section. As Amedeo Quondam has noted, the Libraria of manuscript works 'of Books that the Author has seen in manuscript and which are not yet printed' - is largely fictional, enumerating invented authors and imaginary titles. It provides something like a 'paradoxical and ironic double' to the Libraria that surveys published works. 21 In 1557 Doni joined together his two 'libraries' and published them in an octavo-sized volume printed in Venice by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari. He added to them a third treatise that amplified a text known as early as 1551 on 'the foundation of the Academies, together with their names, their mottoes, their emblems, and the works produced by all the Academicians'. Defined on the 1557 title page as a 'Book necessary and useful to all those who have a need to know the language and who wish to know how to write and to reason about all the authors, books, and works', Doni's two librarie form a complex book. Their bibliographic definition ('they were not only the first Italian national bibliographies; they were also the first bibliographies in a vulgar tongue') 22 fails to do justice to their multiple significance: they proclaim the excellence and the dignity conquered by the vulgar language; they constitute a repertory of contemporary authors; they dismantle, in a parodic key, the recipes for literary invention. Doni's work was known in France, where it gave direct inspiration to the two 'libraries' encountered in chapter 2, the one published in 1584 by Fran~ois de La Croix du Maine and the other published in 1585 by Antoine Du Verdier. 23 These two works share an interest in

74

Libraries without Walls
demonstrating the superiority of the French language over the Italian language by citing the number of authors who wrote in the vernacular, by the fact that French had been used as a literary language longer than Italian, and by the scope of the learning of French expression. This intention is explicit in the Premier volume de Ia Bibliotheque du Sieur de La Croix du Maine. Qui e.st un catalogue general de toutes sortes d' Autheurs, qui ont escrit en Franfois depuis cinq cents ans et plus, jusques a ce jourd'huy {Abel L' Angelier, Paris, 1584). Not only does La Croix du Maine insist in his title on the length of time during which the French language had been used ('for five hundred years and more'), he also com.pares, to the advantage of France, the 'three thousand authors' (in fact 2,031) inventoried in his 'catalogue' and the three hundred (in fact 159) who figured in Doni's Libraria, a fact to which, he adds, 'all can testify with me who have read the book of AntoineFran~ois Dony Florentine, who brought into the light a work of his that he called the Library - that is, the Catalogue of Italian books ancient and modern- that he had printed four years ago, to wit, in the year of salvation 1580' (La Croix du Maine here takes one of the later editions of Doni's work for its first edition, which was published some thirty years earlier). In La Bibliotheque d'Antoine Du Verdier, Seigneur de Vauprivas: Contenant le Catalogue de tous ceux qui ont escrit, ou traduict in Franfois, et autres Dialectes de ce Royaume (Lyons: Barthelemy Honorat, 1585) recognition of the superiority of France does not refer explicitly to Italy: 'In short, excellent Writers and truly good books have so multiplied that it seems now that we have no more need to borrow any knowledge from others, having all sciences among us, perhaps in better form, at least better to our taste and easier for us to learn.' The model from 75

Libraries without Walls
which Du Verdier took inspiration was not Doni but Gesner: 'In our times Conrad Gesner has gathered together all Authors whatsoever in three languages, Hebraic, Greek, and Latin, to his great honour and the common benefit.' It was in reference to that ancient knowledge and that great example ('I have given my book the title of Bibliotheque because Gesner thus entitled his own') that Du Verdier constructed the catalogue by which he intended to prove the excellence of the modems: 'I have worked to do the like for our French people who have written in our language in order to show the world to what extent our country is abundant in good minds.' Unlike La Croix du Maine, Du Verdier feels no need to call on the great antiquity of the use of the French language; he simply surveys modem authors 'from sixty or seventy years past', whom he finds sufficiently numerous and excellent to obviate any need to name older writers, since before that time 'our [authors] were somewhat heavy in their writings.' There are obvious similarities between Doni's Libraria and La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque: both inventory books (both printed and manuscript) written or translated into the vulgar tongue; both offer brief biographies of some of the authors whose works they list (La Croix du Maine says in his subtitle, 'with a Discourse on the lives of the most illustrious and renowned among the three thousand who are included in this work, together with a relation of their compositions both printed and other'); both classify authors in strict alphabetical order by author's given name (from Abel Foulon to Yves Le Fortier for La Croix du Maine). In dedicating his work to the king (Henri III), La Croix du Maine thought it necessary to justify this arrangement that overlooked differences in social condition: 76

Libraries without Walls
There remains one point to note to you, Lord of France, which is that you must not judge it ill if I have put the names of some poeple into an order about which (according to some hasty judgements) you might say that I had erred by doing so, and (that you will acknowledge) that I was not too wrong in this case. As, for example, if you see that I have spoken of the Kings of France, whether of Fran~ois I, Charles IX, or Henri III, would you say that I was mistaken when I happened to place them after their subjects, or else having spoken of the father or the mother when I have put the children first, or disciples before their masters? Certainly I have felt the impropriety of having thus observed an alphabetical or A, B, C order, but I have done so everywhere where it is called for, in order to avoid all calumny and to remain in amity with everyone.

There are none the less fundamental differences between the works of Doni and La Croix du Maine that come from their quite different manner of understanding the library without walls. First, there is a physical and formal difference between the two works: far from being a manageable small-format book in the manner of the Libraria, La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque was a majestic folio volume, a libro da banco, to use Armando Petrucci's terminology, not a libro da bisaccia (saddlebag book) or a libretto da mano (little handbook). 24 The world referred to in La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque is not the book trade and its commerce but the world of the cabinet (book room), of study, and of compilation. In a short piece entitled Desseins, ou Projects du Sieur de La Croix du Maine, presentez au Treschrestien Roy de France et de Pologne Henri III du nom, l'an 1583, au mois de May La Croix du Maine declared that he owns in his library 'eight hundred volumes of Memoirs and diverse Collections, written by my hand and otherwise, and all of my invention or sought
77

Libraries without Walls
by myself, and extracts from all the books that I have read until this day, of which the number is infinite, as can easily be seen by the twenty-five or thirty thousand notebooks and chapters on all sorts of subjects that can fall within man's ken'. Anton Francesco Doni's Libra ria was founded on the practice of literary novelties; La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque was based on the scholastic tradition of commonplace books. A literate man without originality, but not without prolixity since he claims to have composed several hundred works (which he enumerates in a Discours Ju Sieur de La Croix du Maine contenant

sommairement les Noms, Tiltres et Inscriptions de Ia plus grande partie de ses Oeuvres Latines et Fran{oises dated 1579), La
Croix du Maine scrupulously calculates his compilation activities. He states that he wrote three hours per day, and he· figures that if in one hour he filled one sheet of paper of over one hundred lines, his yearly production was some one thousand sheets. None of the works that he wrote in this manner was published (with the exception of the Premier Volume Je Ia Bibliotheque), which means that it is difficult to evaluate the results of his assiduous labours. It is certain, however, that his work was organized intellectually according to the principle of the notebook or the commonplace book and that it gathered under one heading extracts from various authors' works. Hence the central importance that La Croix du Maine gives to the instruments for putting order into this proliferating material, the 'three hundred tables of commonplaces that I have made to clarify my purpose . . . inasmuch as these tables serve as a key to explain what I have written in entire articles'. La Croix du Maine's work also differed from Doni's in that the Premier Volume of his Bibliotheque was 'dedicated and presented to the King', whose engraved portrait
78

Libraries without Walls
figured on the page facing the dedication addressed to him. In both the Desseins, ou Projects of 1583 and the Premier Volume de Ia Bibliotheque published the following year La Croix du Maine pursued the same aim of obtaining the sovereign's protection, which had a cash value in terms of gratifications and posts. The proposition that he submitted in 1583 fitted into this logic of monarchical patronage. It provides a plan to erect a Library, perfect and accomplished in all points, if it please his Majesty to accept it and to furnish the Books, Memoirs, or Collections to fill the one hundred Bookcases whose form or fashion is represented here: each of these containing one hundred volumes, which in all number ten thousand, divided into Books, Chapters, Notebooks, and commonplaces, and further reduced to order of A, B, C in order to locate them more easily. The originality of this 'notice to erect a library', which preceded Naude's project by a half century, lay in La Croix du Maine's desire to embody the immaterial and universal library of loci communes in a real library, one of whose bookcases (one of the cent Buffits) is figured on one page of the work. l-Ie was less interested in accumulating books than in gathering under the one hundred (actually 108) topics that corrresponded to as many buffets works in various forms (printed books but also memoirs and manuscript compilations): 'all that can be found in writing touching that chosen matter ... reduced to such a number and such an order that it will be quite difficult to find anything to change in it.' Secure in his experience and his manuscripts, La Croix du Maine claimed that he could bring together in eight or fifteen days the works needed to fill any one of the one hundred (or 108) buffits.
79

Libraries without Walls
Thus it was on the basis of the practice of the commonplace book that the totally original system of classification proposed by La Croix du Maine should be understood. 25 The work was divided into seven 'orders': 'sacred things', 'arts and sciences', 'description of the Universe both in general and in particular', 'the human race', 'famous men in War', 'the works of God', and 'miscellanies of various Memoirs', subdivided into a total of 108 'classes'. Unlike the twenty-one categories in Gesner's Pandectarum sive Partitiotlum, universalium ... libri XXI (Zurich, 1548), this organization was not intended to construct a tree of knowledge that proceeded by successive divisions. In Gesner's work, the artes et scientia that make up philosophia are divided into substantiales (subdivided into physica or naturali philosophia, metaphysica et theologia gentilium, ethica or morali philosophia, oeconomica, politica, jurisprudentia, medicina, theologia christiana) and praeparantes. The latter category is subdivided into ornantes (historia, geographia, divinatio et magia, and artes illiteratae et mechanicae) and necessariae. The latter are subdivided into mathematicae (arithmetica, geometria, musica, astronomia, and astrologia) and sermocinales, which were grammatica et philologia, dialectica, rhetorica, and poetica. A 'Tabula de singulis pandectarum libris' arranges the various bibliographical classes according to a systematic order, the order of the divisions of philosophia, understood as a trajectory of knowledge leading from the trivium and the quadrivium to Christian theology. There is none of this in the taxonomy proposed by La Croix du Maine, which has no overall governing system, but simply juxtaposes convenient headings in view of gathering together extracts and commonplaces. The fourth 'order', for example, includes the bookcases devoted to 'Man and what is dependent on him', 'Diseases 80

Libraries without Walls
of Men and their remedies', 'Illustrious and other Women', 'Worldly Wisdom, or Instruction for men', 'Divers exercises of Nobles and Gentlemen', 'Miscellaneous exercises fo~ the mind or the body', 'Divers traffics and commerce of men on sea and on land', 'Divers customs and fashions of living everywhere in the universe', 'Men of honest exercise', and 'Officers of long robe, or of the Judiciary'. Because it was to be an example worthy of being imitated, the 'perfect and accomplished' library set up by the king was to be 'the means for rendering the less learned or the totally ignorant well informed and knowledgeable, and also to make the vice-ridden exercise virtue if they conform to their Prince'. Similarly, only the approval of the king could give authority to the Premier Volume de Ia Bibliotheque published in 1584 and to all the other books that were supposed to follow it. At the end of his dedicatory epistle, signed 'FRAN~OIS DE LA CROIX DV MAINE, the anagram for which is RACE DV MANS, SI FIDEL' A soN Rov', La Croix du Maine suggests a more concrete version of the connection with the sovereign: 'If your Majesty should desire to know what are the other [volumes] that I have written and composed for the ornamentation and illustration of your so famous and flourishing Kingdom, I am ready to provide a reading (when it may please you to so command me) of the Discourse that I had printed five years ago touching the general catalogue of my works.' Doni's Libraria had multiple dedicatees (one for each letter of the alphabet) and was aimed at a broader audience. La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque supposes an exclusive relationship, established in proximity by reading aloud, between an author in search of protection and the monarch whose patronage he seeks. 81

Libraries without Walls
A final difference between Doni's work and that of La Croix du Maine is that the Florentine's work was solidly connected with publishing activities; it was 'constructed in direct contact with (and probably backed by) two of the publishers of greatest cultural importance in the midsixteenth century', the Venetians Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, the publisher of the first edition and of the complete edition of the work, and Francesco Marcolini, the publisher of the Seconda Libraria. 26 La Croix du Maine's work originated in the construction of his private library, begun in his university years. That was the collection of printed books and manuscript memoirs that La Croix du Maine had transported to Paris in 1582:
I will say that after having been thirteen or fourteen years

writing, collecting, and seeking Memoirs everywhere, and finally seeing that I had a good many (to the number of seven or eight hundred volumes) I decided to make my home in Paris and, to that effect,· I had three wagons loaded with my volumes and Memoirs and with books, both written by hand and otherwise, taken there, and I arrived in Paris on the last day of May in the year 1582.

The library that La Croix du Maine gathered together and, in part, produced provided support for all his undertakings. For one thing, it was something like a prefiguration of the hundred-bookcase library that he proposed to the king (which was what led him to state that 'the most difficult part of the enterprise is done'). For another, his library formed the matrix of all the ideal libraries that he was to imagine. The library published in 1584 was in fact little more than an Epitome of a more ambitious undertaking, the projected Grande Bibliotheque Fran,oise (and its twin, a Bibliotheque Latine). In these two 82

Libraries without Walls
works (never published) the authors' nan1es were to be accompanied by information on editions, dedicatees, and the texts:
I was not content to have put in those Latin and French

Libraries the catalogue of the works or writings of each author, but beyond that I included by whom they were printed, in what size or format, in what year, how many pages they contained, and above all the name of those men or women to whom they were dedicated, without omitting their full and entire qualities. Aside from that, I put in the beginning or first line of their work and composition and in what age their authors lived.

Imitating Gesner, La Croix du Maine added to his Bibliotheques volumes of Pandectes Latines et Fran,oises ('to wit, a very ample Catalogue of all the Authors who have written in each art, science or profession of studies, which I have divided according to the seven arts that we call liberal') and several volumes of what he called a mentionnaire, 'which is like a book of commonplaces, or an Aggregation of authors who have made mention of particular things'. Claiming to have scrutinized the works of 'ten thousand authors', La Croix du Maine notes that in these mentionnaires (also unpublished) he 'quotes passages of the said authors further observing and noting in what book, what chapter or what article, on what leaf, even on what page or side can be found what I have read, and in what size is the book, and of what printing'. Three different principles of classification exist concurrently in La Croix du Maine's works. The first organizing criterion is the category of the author. The authorfunction, as Foucault defines it, is already sketched out here. 27 In the one published volume as in his Grande Bibliotheque, La Croix du Maine makes this the basic

83

Libraries without Walls
criterion for assigning discourses, which are organized alphabetically by their authors' given names. In announcing that he will provide authors' 'lives' (written, La Croix du Maine tells us, in imitation of Suetonius, Plutarch, and Paolo Giovio), he equates men of letters with military leaders, famous for their exploits, and with princes and grandees, masters of their deeds. None the less, this first scheme for assigning works did not neglect the power of patronage. La Croix du Maine demonstrates this when he promises to note, for all the works mentioned in his unpublished Grande Bibliotheque, 'above all [emphasis mine] the name of those men and women to whom they were dedicated, without omitting their full and entire qualities'. A work thus belongs as much to the person to whom it has been dedicated as it does to the person who has written it and, in the ideal library as on the title page, the two names of the author and the patron stood as proof of this. A third criterion for classifying works eliminates assignment to an individual in favour of placing each work within an order or class of knowledge. It is the tension between the name and the commonplace that underlies Gesner's dual enterprise, the Bibliotheca universalis of 1545 and the Pandectarum . . . libri XXI three years later - a work that was presented as 'Secondus hie Bibliothecae nostrae Tomus est, totius philosophiae et omnium bonarum artium atque studiorum Locos communes et Ordines universales simul et particulares complectens.' That same tension is reflected in La Croix du Maine's bibliographic zeal, even though his grandiose projects were never realized. The almost simultaneous publication of the two Bihliotheques (May 1584 for La Croix du Maine; 1585, with an end printing date of 15 December 1584 for Du Verdier) 84

Libraries without Walls
raises a problem. La Croix du Maine took the initiative and parried any possible accusation that he had plagiarized a work that had not yet been published but whose publication he knew was imminent, as proved .by the entry under 'Antoine du Verdier' in the Premier Volume Je Ia Bibliotheque: 'I have been assured that he is about to have printed a Bibliotheque Fran,oise of his own, of which I am not jealous.' Declaring furthermore that he never knew of the existence of Du Verdier's work, La Croix du Maine claims anteriority for his own venture, begun more than fifteen years before, and stresses the great distance ('more than a hundred leagues') that separated their places of residence, Paris and Lyons, where Du Verdier had settled in 1580. For good measure, La ·Croix du Maine states his scorn of plagiarism: 'I will confess to having undertaken to write a book against such kinds of people, usurpers taking credit for the work of others, which work I have entitled "The Rod, or the Scourge of Plagiarists", or of those who attribute to themselves and put under their own names works or compositions of which they are not the authors or inventors.' Furthermore, he founds the authority of his own book on the resources of his library and on his own knowledge: 'As for the authors I have mentioned in my work, I have seen or read them, and have them still before me for the most part without having borrowed them, for I will firmly say that I have never owed any Bookseller for books, and I have spent more than ten thousand livres in the fifteen or sixteen years since I began to love letters.' As in the travel narrations of the age, auto-psie - the action of seeing with one's own eyes ('I have seen them') - became the exclusive guarantee of truth. That certification of authenticity by direct experience is not without paradox in an author who compiles

85

Libraries without Walls
extracts and commonplaces in innumerable notebooks that he then presents as learning itself. Du Verdier (who was first a financial officer in the election of Forez, then controleur general des finances in Lyons), 28 weighed heavier in the social scales than La Croix du Maine, a simple provincial gentleman who had moved to Paris. Du Verdier's response was two-pronged: first, he mocked the erudite fanfaronades of his rival and expressed doubts about the existence of the many works La Croix du Maine promised: Someone (whose name I will not mention} who has sent me a great notebook and inventory of the books that he says he has composed before he was yet twenty years old [the catalogue of his works that La Croix du Maine had printed in 1579], which have surpassed five hundred volumes in number, decorated with the handsomest titles that one could imagine and which contain more than one hundred pages - a ridiculous and unbelievable, if not impossible, thing. Furthermore, after Du Verdier had a look at the work in question (which he lists as being printed in Paris in his entry 'Fran~ois de La Croix du Maine' in his own Bibliotheque), he questions the accuracy of the information given by La Croix du Maine because he surveys fictitious or unproductive authors and includes in his work 'several [authors] that never were in nature, or if they were, have written nothing, as he himself confesses'. In its format (a heavy folio volume) and in its form (organized alphabetically by name), Antoine Du Verdier's Bibliotheque was akin to La Croix du Maine's work, but it is constructed on a different principle. Du Verdier's

86

Libraries without Walls
imagined library is not directly dependent upon the · constitution of the author's own collection but is rather a conceptual entity detached from any particular material presence. Du Verdier's catalogue is indeed a 'library', but it is an all-inclusive library: 'As in the Library divers books are organized, where they are kept as if in their proper place, thus as many divers Authors and books are here put in such an order that at first sight one can locate them in their place and thus remen1ber them.' In this exhaustive inventory every reader must be able to find what he or she needed and use that information to construct a library made up of real books. It was in order to facilitate that task that Antoine Du Verdier gave the bibliographic information that was lacking in the Epitome published by La Croix du Maine. As the title states, the work promises 'the place, fortn, name, and date, where, how, and by whom [the works listed] were brought to light [that is, printed]'. There was thus no contradiction between the design of a 'universal library of French books', which necessarily had no physical reality, and the making of a bibliographic instrument useful to all those who might want to create a collection. In parallel fashion, the attempt to be complete that led l)u Verdier to mention Lutheran and Calvinist authors who wrote in French led to another aim: to make sure that 'Catholics are warned which books are reproved and censured so that they will flee then1'. Whatever Du Verdier's own religious sentiments may have been, his Bibliotheque is thus explicitly invested with the same function as the catalogues of censured books put out by the Faculty of Theology of Paris, whose Index was first published in 1544, also using authors' names listed in alphabetical order (of family nan1es, however) as the primary criterion for classifying titles. 29

87

Libraries without Walls
The various meanings given to the term for a library thus clearly show one of the major tensions that inhabited the literate of the early modern age and caused them anxiety. A universal library (or at least universal in one order of knowledge) could not be other than fictive, reduced to the dimensions of a catalogue, a nomenclature, or a survey. Conversely, any library that is actually installed in a specific place and that is made up of real works available for consultation and reading, no matter how rich it might be, gives only a truncated image of all accumulable knowledge. The irreducible gap between ideally exhaustive inventories and necessarily incomplete collections was experienced with intense frustration. It led to extravagant ventures assembling - in spirit, if not in reality - all possible books, all discoverable titles, all works ever written. 'When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all· books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness.'

88

Epilogue

As the twentieth century wanes, our dream is to be able to surmount the contradiction that long haunted Western Europeans' relationship with the book. The library of the future seems indeed to be in a sense a library without walls, as were the libraries that Gesner, Doni, and La Croix du Maine erected on paper. Unlike their catalogues, which furnished authors' names, the titles of works, and at times summaries of or extracts from the works, the library of the future is inscribed where all texts can be summoned, assembled, and read: on a screen. In the universe of remote communications made possible by computerized texts and electronic diffusion, texts are no longer prisoners of their original physical, material existence. Separated from the objects on which we are used to finding them, texts can be transmitted in a new form; there is no longer a necessary connection between where they are conserved and where they are read. The opposition long held to be insurmountable between the closed world of any finite collection, no matter what its size, and the infinite · universe of all texts ever written is thus theoretically annihilated: now the catalogue of all catalogues ideally

Epilogue
listing the totality of written production can be realized in a universal access to texts available for consultation at the reader's location. This projection towards the future, written here in the present tense, retains something of the basically contradictory utopias proposed by Louis-Sebastien Mercier and Etienne Boullee. Still, it is perhaps not too soon to reflect on the effects of the change that it thus promises and announces. If texts are emancipated from the form that has conveyed them since the first centuries of the Christian era - the codex, the book composed of quires from which all printed objects with which we are familiar derive - by the same token all intellectual technologies and all the operations at work in the production of meaning will be modified. 'Forms effect meanings', D. F. McKenzie reminds us/ and his lesson, which should be taken to heart, warns us to be on guard. against the illusion that wrongly reduces texts to their semantic content. When it passes from the codex to the monitor screen the 'same' text is no longer truly the same because the new formal devices that offer it to its reader modify the conditions of its reception and its comprehension. When the text is carried by a new technique and embodied in a new physical form, it can be offered to manipulation by a reader who is no longer limited, as with the printed book, to adding hand-written matter in the spaces left blank in typographic composition and in binding. 2 At the same time, the end of the codex will signify the loss of acts and representations indissolubly linked to the book as we now know it. In the form that it has acquired in Western Europe since the beginning of the Christian era, the book has been one of the most powerful metaphors used for conceiving of the cosmos,

90

Epilogue
nature, history, and the human body. 3 If the object that has furnished the matrix of this repertory of images (poetic, philosophical, scientific) should disappear, the references and the procedures that organize the 'readability' of the physical world, equated with a book in codex form, would be profoundly upset as well. Realizing the dream of the Renaissance bibliographers of making the particular place in which the reader finds himself or herself coincide perfectly with universal knowledge, thus putting that knowledge within grasp, inevitably presupposes a new definition of the concept of the text, wrenched away from its immediate association {so evident to us) with the specific fortn of the book- the codex - that some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago replaced another form, the volumen or roll. 4 The historian's musings proposed in the present work thus lead to a question essential in our own present time - not the overworked question of the supposed disappearance of writing, which is more resistant than has been thought, but the question of a possible revolution in the forms of its dissemination and appropriation.

16 See the analysis in Carla Hesse, 'Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship'. Hesse emphasizes the impact of Condorcet's and Sieyes's position on revolutionary legislation: 'The democratic bourgeois revolution did not mark a further step in the progressive consolidation of the notion of the author. Rather, the revolutionaries explicitly intended to dethrone the absolute author, a creature of privilege, and recast him, not as a private individual (the absolute bourgeois), but rather as a public servant, as the model citizen' (p. 130). 17 See Woodmansee, 'The Genius and the Copyright', esp. her analysis (pp. 444-6) of the distinction between form and content as proposed by Fichte in his essay, 'Beweis der Unrechtmassigkeit des Buchernachdrucks: Ein Rasonnement und eine Parabel' (1793). 18 Roland Mortier, L'originalite: Une nouvelle categorie esthetique au siecle des Lumieres (Droz, Geneva, 1982). 19 Martha Woodmansee, 'The Interests in Disinterestedness: Karl Philip Moritz and the Emergence of the Theory of Aesthetic Autonomy in Eighteenth-Century Germany', Modern Language Quarterly, 45 (1984), pp. 22-47. 20 On the evolution of this change, see Eric Walter, 'Les auteurs et le champ litteraire', in Histoire de /'edition Jran,aise, ed.

The two works were republished together in the eighteenth century under the title, Les Bibliotheques Fran,aises de La Croix du Maine et de Du Verdier, sieur de Vauprivas, Nouvelle Edition dediee au Roi, revue, corrigee et augmentee d'un discours sur le Progres des Lettres en France, et des Remarques historiques, critiques et litteraires de M. de Ia Monnoye et de M. le President Bouhier, de 1'Academie fran~aise, de M.

Nel terzo, si /egg(~ l'inventione dell'Academie, insieme cott i soprattomi, i motti, le imprese, et /'opere fatte da tutti gli Academici (Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, Venice, 1557). It is worth noting that unlike the Bibliotheques of La Croix du Maine and Du Verdier, which were published in monumental folio editions, the works of Anton Francesco Doni were easy to handle and to carry since they were printed in smaller formats, duodecimo for the 1550 edition and octavo in 1557. On Doni's Libraria, see Amedeo Quondam, 'La letteratura in tipografia', in Letteratura ita Iiana, ed.

Keith Michael Baker (Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1987), pp. 261-91. 35 Foucault's essay has been read in two ways. One way stresses the connection between the author-function and the philosophical and juridical definition of the individual and of private property (see Hesse, 'Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship', p. 109: 'The relation between the "author" and the "text,'' (Foucault) suggests, emerged historically as the cultural incarnation of a new axis in sociopolitical discourse: the inviolable relation between the rights-bearing individual and private property'). The other way emphasizes the dependence of the author-function on state and church censorship (as with Joseph Loewenstein, who recognizes, speaking of Foucault in 'The Script in the Marketplace', p. 111, 'His nearly exclusive concentration of the effect of the censoriousness of Church and State on the development of modem authorship has been salutary, though it slights the effect of the market in books on that development'). The first reading leads to emphasizing the eighteenth century; the second, the sixteenth century. 36 J. M. De Bujanda, Francis M. Higman, James K.

La Celestina and many of its imitations was published anonymously, as were many chivalric romances, Lazarillo and its sequel, and, finally, a fairly large number of books of devotion in the form of romances.' 37 Jeanne Veyrin-Forrer, 'Antoine Augereau, graveur de lettres, imprimeur et libraire parisien (d.t534)', Paris et lie-de-Prance: Memoires publies par Ia Federation des Societes historiques et archeologiques de Paris et de ['Ile-de-France, 8 (1956), pp. 103-56, reprinted in Veyrin-Forrer, La lettre et le texte: Trente annees de recherches sur l'histoire du livre (Collection de l'Ecole Normale Superieure de Jeunes Filles, Paris, 1987), pp. 3-50. 38 On the trial of Etienne Dolet in 1543, see Francis Higman, Censorship and the Sorbonne: A Bibliographical Study of Books in French Censored by the Faculty of Theology of the University of Paris, 1520-15 51 (Librairie Droz, Geneva, 1979), pp. 96-9. 39 On the 'Do let case', the classic article is Lucien Febvre, 'Dolet, propagateur de l'Evangile', Bibliotheque d'Humanisme et Renaissance, 7 (1945), pp. 98-170, reprinted in Febvre, Au coeur religieux du XVIe siecle, 2nd edn (S.E.

Codex in Crisis
The Book Dematerializes

Alfred Kazin began work in 1938 on his first book, On Native Grounds. Thf child of poor and diffident Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, he stndied at City College. While uninspired professors processed large classes and Stalinistil and Trotskyites tnrned the cafeteria into a battleground, Kazin-;omehow de· · veloped a passion for literature and began to write reviews. He had money or backing, yet he managed to put together an extraordinary, com· prehensive book, to tell the sto~y of the !,reat American intellectual andliter· ·. ary movements from the late nineteenth centnry to his own time and to set · them in a richly evoked historical co.;t~. One institution made his work .· possible: the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street, where he spent almost five years. As Kazin later recalled:

Anything I had heard of and wanted to see, the blessed place owned: first editions of American novels out of those germinal decades after the Civil War that led to my theme of the "modern"; old catalogues from long-departed Chicago publishers who had been young men in the 1890s trying to support a little realism; yellowing, crumbling, but intact sets of the old Masses (1911-1918), which was to the Stalinist New Masses what St. Francis is to the Inquisition. The library's holdings taught him "what hope, elan, intellectual freshness C:une with those pioneer realists out of the Middle West who said there was no runerjcan literature but the one they were rushing to create." Without leaving Manhattan, Kazin read his way into "lonely small towns, prairie villages, isolated colleges, dustf law offices, national magazines and provincial 'acadc· mies' where no one suspected that the obedient-lookingyoung reporters, law

clerks, librarians, teachers would turn out to be Willa Cather, Robert Frost, Sinclair Lewis, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore." 1 Kazin and his close friend Richard Hofstadter, with whom he shared quick lunches at the Automat, fast games of ping-pong, and an occasional afternoon of newsreels, were only two of the countless writers, readers, and critics who over the centuries have found themselves and their subjects in libraries. It is an old story, quiet and reassuring: bookish boy or girl enters the cool, dark library and discovers loneliness and freedom. For the last ten years or so, however, the cities of the book have been anything but quiet. The computer and the Internet have transformed reading more dramatically than anything since the printing press. In great libraries from Stanford to Oxford, pages turn, scanners hum, databases grow-and the world ofbooks, of copyrighted information and repositories of individual copies, trembles. Scenarios for the apocalypse have often involved books: Revelation mentions letters, describes a book with seven seals; and uses the closing of a book as a vivid metaphorfor the end of the physical world: "And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together" (6:14). But at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the rhetorical situation l;tas reversed itself. Great information projects, mounted by Google and rival companies, have elicited millenarian prophecies about texts as we know them: claims that the printed :· book, magazine, and newspaper are as dead as the trees their paper comes from, and predictions that digital repositories of human knowledge will not only replace but will also improve on them. In 2006, Kevin Kelly, the self. styled "chief Maverick" of Wired, published one of the more influential of l;hese in the New York Times. In a thoughtful review of the intricate legal issues associated with digitizing books in copYfight, Kelly vividly describes the virtuallibrary that Google and its rivals and partnors are creating. In the near future, Kelly believes, "all the books in the· world" will "become a single liquid fabric of interconnected words· and ideas." The user of the electronic library will be able to bring together "all texts-past and present, multilingual-on .a particular subject," and by doing so ''a clearer sense of what we as a civilization, a species, do know and don't know. The white spaces of our collective ignorance are highlighted, while the golden peaks of our knowledge are drawn with completeness;"' Others have evoked even more millennia! prospects: a universal archive that will contain not only all books and artiCles but also .all documents everywhere; the basis for a total history of the human race.

CODEX IN CRISIS

Librarians, publishers, professors, printers-all of us are fascinated by the prospect that such prophets conjure up: a future in which readers in search of information always turn to screens rather than books, and, as e-books improve, even readers in search of pleasure begin to do the same. This prospect infuriates some acolytes of the book: for example, Jean-Noel Jeanneney, historian and former director of the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, who in 2005 published a sad little volume in which he denounced Google Books as a typical American plot, at once imperialist and boorish, rather like the war in Iraq. Google, he argued, win first fill the Web with books in English and then profit by distorting the world of learning and literature. Only energetic countermeasures--preferably sponsored by national governments rather than corporations--can save European literature and scholarship.' Instinct and experience predispose me to find some substance in critiques of the new textual world. I am a lover of old libraries-the libraries of the 1960s and I 970s, in which I became i. scholar. As a student in those years, I lived in what felt like a bibliomaniac's paradise and in retrospect still seems to have been an idyll. Books and journals were cheap, and library budgets were healthy. Even in the United States, the stacks-of good libraries from Connecticut to California were loaded With sixteenth- and seventeenth-century tomes that no one had yet declared rife, as well as reprmts of anything the library did not possess in its original form. I prowled,the vast open-stack collections at the University of Chicago, where I studied, and Cornell and Princeton, where I taught, pulling books off the shelves by dozens, as fascinated by what they could tell me about nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars and students as by what they revealed about the more distant past I studied. As a New Yorker, like Kazin, I also loved to sit in the shabby but dignified reading rooms of the New York Public Library, waiting for the indicator to show that my books had arrived. In those days, many libraries did not have coffee shops, and those that had one were Jnore likely to provide vending rna. chines than fresh espresso and cappuccino. Nonetheless, they became a chosen hangout, for me and for others like me. Late in the 1970s, when I learned that the Princeton library had identified me as a "heavy user,'' I was not surprised, though the choice of terminology worried me a little. The love of lib~es hru; taken me to strange and wonderful places: to the British Library in London,_ still housed in the 1970s under the pale blue nineteenth-century dome that sheltered Karl Marx, Coli;, Wilson; and other outsiders; to the Warburg Insti-

lute, also in London, whose founder and successors arranged their books by what they called the "good neighbor principle," so that readers who looked for a particular book in the stacks would be surprised and edified by the others next to it; to the Bodleian Library, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden, and the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana. One of the many things I have learned from years misspent amid the smells of dust and noble rot is that every library embodies a perspective of its own. Their contents, the way in which manuscripts and books are catalogued and arranged on shelves, and their gaps-all tell stories to those who can listen, about writers, readers, and collectors, and the historical worlds they inhabited. Scholars become great when they attend to what these purpose-built collections, with their distinctive systems '\fld oral traditions, have to teach. No one has described the austerely local nature of humanistic scholarship more precisely than the historian Peter Brown, who traces his own formation to the time he spent in the Lower Reading Room of the Bodleian Library: It was a world of books, each deeply rooted in the landscape of a single library. They were available in one place only, for rapt readers, who, themselves, had taken on something of the quality of natural features. They were visible year after year at their desks. Over'the years, from 1953 to 1978, I passed from status to status. In these years, my mind changed <_>ften. But in the Lower Reading Room of Bodley nothing seemed to change. Opposite me, for instance, th~re always sat a known authority on the relation between Augustine's Scriptural readings and the liturgy of Hippo. He was not a member of the university. He was a clergyman who came up regularly from his vicarage in the countryside of Oxfordshire. I observed that he wore bedroom slippers. Frequently, the slippers appe')fedto win out over the books, and he wonld fill asleep. A prim young man at il:hat time, I wondered if I could really trust the views of so somnolent a· person on the Donatist schism. But the reverend gentleman stood for a wider world oflearning, open to more professions and capa-· hie of nourishing many more forms of scholarly endeavor than that which I now expect to find, among my colleagues, in a seminar, room. It was for persons such as hirn-,-"-for personsoflearrting and of general culture, who were not necessarily academics-as well as for my students and c_olleagues at Oxford, that I wrote. my Augustine of Hippo, and went

out of my way to ensure that it would be published iu England by Faber's of London and not by a University Press. Figures such as these communicated the uncanny stillness of a shared life oflearniug.4 To have known reading in this artisanal form is to distrust any plan that treats books as interchangeable and aims-as Google does-at universality. But it would be absurd to joiu Jeanneney's crusade. Enter a word or phrase in any European language iu the Google Books search field and you learn immediately that the system already contains thousands of texts in languages other than English. As to the French goveinment, its last great gift to the world of books was the library that Jeanneney directed, a buildiug that looks like the set from some forgotten dystopian sci-fi film of the 1970s-thiuk Logan~ Run-and is about as much fun to work iu. As a liberal, iu the current AngloAmerican sense, I believe that competent governments do many thiugs better than markets can, but I am not at all sure that France's statist way of providing books for readers is a case in po_iut. The Bibliothl:que Nationale deserves credit for its own database, Gallica, which offers a canon ·<{"'3Jfefully selected texts, well digitized, and for its provision of up!to-aate foreign books. But it has yet to show that it can, or wants to, mobilize ;md make accessible to the world a vast, disorderly mass of texts, canonical and nontanonical, for readers to use freely. Many American and British librarians are exuberant about the prospect of briuging the books iu their custody to new publics, through new ll)edia, and anyone can see why. After all, one thiug that Google Books makes clearer every day is that you can study many aspects of French thought and literature as deeply iu New York as in Paris, and a lot more efficiently.

will not have access to in the next ten or twenty years. We have dearly reached something of a watershed, a new era in the history of text production and consumption. On many fronts, traditional periodicals and books are making way for blogs, computer databases, and other electronic formats. But magazines and books still sell a lot of copies. The current drive to digitize the written record is one of a number of aitical projects in the long saga of our drive to accumulate, store, and.retrieve information efficiently. It will result not in the infotopia that the prophets conjure up, but in one more in a series of new information ecologies, all of them challenging, in which readers, writers, and producers of text have learned to survive and flourish. For centuries--for millennia-the scribes and sd10lars who produced books often were also the ones who organized them in collections and devised ways ofhelping readers find and master what they needed. As early as the third millennium BCE, Mesopotamian scribes began to catalogue the tablets in their collections. For ease of reference, they appended content descriptions to the edges of tablets, and they adopted systematic shelving for quick identification of related telCts. The greatest of ancient collections, the Li~ of Alexandria, had, in its ambition and its methods, a good de.al ~-common ~th Go ogle's efforts. It was founded around 300 BCE by Ptolemy I, who had inherited Alexandria, a brand-new city, from Alexander the Great. A historian with a taste for poetry, Ptolemy decided to amass a comprehensive collection of Greek literature, philosophy, and science. Like Google, the library developed an efficient pro~edure for capturing and reproducing texts. When ships docked in Alexandria, any scrolls found on them were confiscated and taken to the library. The staff made copies for the owners and stored the originals in heaps until they could be catalogued-a fact that gives some idea of the scale of the operation. Copies of Homer obtained this way were designafed "those fr~m ships." At the'collection's height, it contained more than half a million scrolls, a welter of ip.formation that forced librarians to develop new organizational methods. For the first time, texts were shelved alphabetically. Faced with this daunting mass, the poet and scholar Callinmchus drew up comprehensive bibliographies. Enterprising forgers had run up so many fake' texts to satisfy . the library's appetite that he had to distinguish systematically between the . genuine works of the· great poets and the spurious ones that the library also · possessed. Gradually, the library became a center of focused sd1olarship, where a. series oflibrarians__.:.Zenqdotus of Ephesus, Aristophanes ofByzan·

texts. Many details of their work, only partially preserved after the destruction of the library, remain controversial. Yet it seems clear that they not only devised new philological methods but also standardized the text of Homer that circulated in Egypt during the Hellenistic and Roman periods-a major achievement in an age when every text was copied by hand. 5 Six hundred years after Callimachus, Eusebius, a historian and bishop of the seacoast city of Caesarea in Palestine, assembled and corrected Christian sources in the local library. There he also devised a complex network of
cross-references, known as ""canon tables," which enabled readers to find

parallel passages in the four Gospels-a system that the distinguished modem scholar James O'Donnell recently described as the world's first set of hot links. A deft impresario, Eusebius mobilized a team of secretaries and scribes to produce Bibles featuring his new tables. The emperor Constantine acknowledged that Eusebius had developed a uniquely efficient system. In the 330s, he placed an order with the bishop for fifty parchment codex Bibles for the chnrches of his new city, 'Constantinople.J::onstantine himself supplied the necessary skins (in the age of manuscript('blo'od sacrifice was the price of beautiful books), and sent them to Ells$ius by the imperial rapid delivery service. He knew. that only the scriptorium in Caesarea conld tum the raw materials into accurate, properly formatted _bibles in the short time he allowed.6 Throughout the Middle Ages, the great monastic libraries continued ·to engage in the twin enterprises of accumulating and cataloguing large holdings and, in their scriptoria,.makillg and disseminating copies of key texts. The rise of printing in fifteenth-century Europe transformed the regimes oflibrarians and readers. Into a world alniady literate and curious, the printers brought, within half a century, some28,000 titles and millions of individual books-many times more than Ellropean libraries had previously held. Reports of new worlds,· new theologies, and new ideas about the universe traveled faster and sold for lower prices than ever before, Even in this period of aggressive expansion, the traditional skills oflearned librarians continued to find employment in the enn:epreneurial world of printing. Giovanni Andrea Bussi, librarian of the papal collection of Sixtus IV, also served as .advisor to two German printers in Rome, Conrad'Sweyoheym and Arnold Pannartz. They printed the classics and the church fathers in handsome editions· that were siguificantly cheaper than manuscripts. Lo-

cal scholars, thrilled by the speed and economy of the new process, made the tranquil gardens of the Vatican resound with their praises. Bussi edited and corrected their copy and sometimes added eloquent prefaces to their books. Like many first movers, however, Bussi and his partners soon learned that they had overestimated the market, which could not absorb editions that ran from a few hundred toJUore than a thousand copies. They found themselves-as Bussi eloquently complained to pope Sixtus IV-in a Roman palace full of the drying sheets they had printed but empty offood. 7 They were not the last entrepreneurs of new information technologies to experience this kind of difficulty. Still, the model Bussi helped to establish-one in which erudite scholars advised hardheaded printers--remained standard in the sixteenth century, and some of the printers who rejected it did so only because they themselves were learned men, who conld choose and correct their own copy. Over the next three centuries, the profit-driven industry of publishing and the industrious scholarship of theilibraries became separate spheres. Yet in the last few years, as sales of urtiversity press books have dwindled and journal subscription prices have gone.through thp-FGjlf. this ancient model has been resurgent. Through their electrortic publlshing programs, libraries have begun to take on many of the tasks that traditionally fell to urtiversitypresseS, such as distribution of PhD dissertations and reproduction oflocal book and document collections. Ithaka, a nonprofit consrutancy that issued a report on scholarly publishing in Jwy 2007, noted the excitement that these new possibilities had · generated among librarians.' Irofti.cally, neither the consnltants nor the many commentators on their work realized that in regairting partial control over the ways that tex!soare processed and made available, great libraries were not breaking new ground but going back t,o the future. The new electrortic library that not ocly sto~es texts but also publishes them on its Web page, is engaging in a spread of activities that Eusebius}vonld have found perfectly natural. Fast, .reliable methods of seatch and .retrieval are sometimes identified as the hallmilik of our information age: "Search is eve,rything" has become a proverb. Bpt scholars have grappled for millennia with too much information, and in periods when information resources seemed to be growing es, pecially fast, they devised ingenious ways to control-lmd use the floods. The Renaissance, du;ing which numbers of available texts grew at an,imprecedented pace, was-th~ ~;~reat age of systematic note 'takirig. Manuals taught students how to condense the contents of all of literature, ancient and

\

modern, in abstracts and extracts organized by headings. Jeremias Drexel, a seventeenth-century Jesuit who wrote one of the standard treatments, showed how much this art was valued by the title he chose for it, "Goldmine." His frontispiece was even more eloquent-it juxtaposed a group of miners digging for gold in the ground with a single scholar taking notes on the truer gold in his books.' Scholars well grounded in this regime, like Isaac Casaubon, spun tough, efficient webs of notes around the margins of their books and in their notebooks-hundreds of Casaubon's annotated books and almost sixty of his copybooks survive-and used them to retrieve information about everything from the religion of Greek tragedy to the history of Egyptian culture in late antiquity. 10 Then, as now, attractive and costly new technologies took shape. Jacques Cujas, a prominent sixteenth-century legal scholar, amazed visitors to his study when he showed them the rotating barber's chair and moveable book stand that enabled him to keep ~any open books in view at the same time, moving himself or the text as the occasion required. Thomas Harrison, a seventeenth-century English, inventor who seems to have sprung from the pages of a novel by J. G. Farrell, e;;;ii>ed an information eabinet that he called the "Ark of Studies." A squad or readers, he explained, could summarize and excerpt the vast number ofbooks being published, and arrange their notes by subject on labeled metal hooks, somewhat in the manner of a twentiethcentury card index. The great German philosopher Leibniz-perhaps the last , man who was simultaneously at the cutting edges of history, philosophy, and natural science--enthusiastically obtained one of Harrison's cabinets and used it in his research.U For less erudite so'uls, simpler techniques abridged the process of looking for information, much as Wikipedia and Google do now. Erasmus said-and believed-that every serious student must read the entire corpus of the classics and make his own notes on them. But he also composed a magoificent reference work, the Adages, i1) whlch he laid out and -explicated thousands of pithy ancient sayings-and provided neat subject indexes to help readers find what they needed. For centuries, thousands of schoolboys first encoun. . tered the wisdom of the ancients in this handy, predigested form: When Erasmus told the story of Pandora, he said that she did not open ajar-as in the original version ofthe story by the Greek poet Hesiod-but instead box. In every European language except Italian, as Erwin and DoraPanofsky showed

long ago, "Pandora's box" became proverbial, as playwrights, poets, and essayists rriade Erasmus's collection their first port of call for a neat way to express the dangers of thoughtless action, not to mention their fear of women. 12 Like Al Gore's invention of the Internet, Pandora's box is a canard-one made ubiquitons, almost universal, by the power of a new information technology. Even the best search procedures, in other words, depend on the databases they explore, and sometimes yield factoids, rather than facts. From the eighteenth century onward, a new pattern gradually established itself. States, universities, and academies maintained great research libraries, more or less available to the public. At their most ambitious, they offered readers books. and manuscripts in encyclopedic abundance. In\perial libraries collected information on a worldwide scale, vividly symbolized by the enormous domes that covered their central reading rooms. Their staffs also pioneered in information retrieval. They nofonly organized the books on the shelves but also devised mnltiple indexes to help readers find the information they needed-including such longtime stat:i~ as the printed catalogues of the British Library and the Library ofCongress. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries also witnessed a vast democratization of general reading-a story be~utifnlly told in part by Jonathan Rose.l' Cheap collections like Everyman's Library and the Haldeman-Jnlius Little Blue Books brought solid .books other than the· Bible and the Book of Martyrs into working-class households. Public libraries offered little islands of 11,eace and print among the sprawling, clpotic tenement blocks of the industrial cities. The old regimes of note talcing became less important, as the dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, and collections of quotations that had been developing since the eighteenth century became more and more a part of everyday bourgeois life. The title used ~or one popnlar form of reference work in Germany and Russia, "Conv~ation Lexicon," gives.a sense of what books like this could do for readers who, like so many Chekhov characters, wanted,to converse all_ day on every subject under the sun. Yet no collection, no work of reference could offer all the books or information relevant to a complex subject, In the 1940s, Fremont Rider, a practitioner of Extreme Librarianship at Wesleyan, prophesied .that titl~s were multiplying so quickly that they would soon overflow even the biggest sep; of stacks. He and his iofluential acolyteVerner Clapp argued that microphotography could elim" inate this problem. Just photograph the books, store the images on cards, and

298

toss the dusty, decaying originals. The card catalogue in its drawers would become the actual research library, which could survive and grow forever. Readers would be able to find anything they wanted, in a dean, accessibk form, while librarians could stop building and maintaining expensive open stacks. 14 Projects multiplied. Some of them-like Eugene Power's Short Title Catalogue project, which distributed 26,000 early English books on microfilm-genuinely changed tbe working lives of scholars and students. Meanwhile, otber companies offered texts on microfiche, or simply reprinted books tbat had become rare or fragile on modem, acid-free paper. From the 1950s on, libraries began to resound witb the deep voices of salesmen who claimed tbat tbey could provide vast runs of material immune to decay. The results were genuinely dramatic. As old universities expanded and new ones sprouted in tbe 1950s and 1960s, generous funding enabled tbem to buy what was available on film or microfiche and in reprint form and tbus to cre· ate effective collections in ten or fifteen years--sometimes from a standing start. Many ambitious lil{~s devised and carried out tbeir own schemes as well. Suddenly, you coul<! conduct serious research on tbe Vatican Library's collections not only in Rome but also in St. Louis, where tbe Knights of Columbus assembled a vast corpns of thicrofilms; or study tbe Milanese Bib· lioteca Ambrosiana at Notre Dame. For tbe first time, you could become an expert bibliographer or paleographer, edittexts or excerpt ancient newspapers and journals, without ever leaving home in California or Kansas. (Scholars, of course, did tbeir best to conce'!l tbese facts from tbe deans who funded their research travel.) But tbe film- and reprint-based libraries of tbe 1950s and 1960s never became really comprehensive. The commercial companies tbat did tbe filming naturally concentrated on marketable materials. Nonprofit sponsors concentrated on tbe texts that mattered to:tb6m---Catb~lic institutions, for example, on medieval Latin manuscripts. No· dear logic determined which texts were reprinted on paper, which were .filmed, and which remained in obscurity. It all cost a great deal more tban anyone had envisioned at first. Some projects--' especially tbose tbat used microfiches-<:ncoU!J.tered sales resistance, and a number of tbe early efforts died or became dormant; Onee-prosperous reprint publishers ended up, like Bussi and his associates, drowning in unsold books.

Library users who had once been able to savor the artistry of Wrnsor McCay's "Little Nemo in Slumberland" in the colorful pages of the New York Herald found themselves squinting at black-and-white images on blurry screens. In this new, Darwinian ecology, the photographic revolution dwindled-physically, in most libraries--from a sweeping project to change the way everyone read and worked to a single room where graduate students, fuculty, and unusually diligent undergraduates pored over texts that they were willing to read even in an unappealing, black-and-white form. Rider's promise of a world of information on neatly filed cards yielded thousands of reels of film that must be cranked and maneuvered to be read. It is a lesson to remember as we move through a new age-of rapid change and great promises."
{)

Google's Empire The current era of digitalization unquestionably outstrips that of microfilm, in ambition and in achievement. Few individuals ev~r owned microfilm or microfiche readers, after all, whereas most serious readers in developed countries now have direct access to personal computers or laptops and an Internet connection. The changes wrought by all this are obviotis. Even the most traditionally minded of scholars, faced with· the need to look up a date, a fuct, or a text, gen~rally begins not by going to a library reference room crammed with encyclopedias and handbooks, but by consulting a s~arch engine. "Conservatively," a cheerful editor from Cambridge University Press told me, "95 percent of all scholarly inquiries start at Google." And that'makes ;ense: Google, the nerdiest of corporations, has roots in the world of bpoks. Ascoiding to oral tradition, Google's founders started out with a plan to create an electronic database of the books at Stanford and turned to ~.Web only because it "offered, .at that time, a smaller sample size. Google's fumoussearch algorithm, moreover, emulates the principle of schol.atly citation. By counting up ancfevalu.ating earlier linlcs, Google steers users. to the sources that oihers have already found helpful. In a sense, the hypermodern search engine reselflbles nothing more tlian a teeming mass of old-fashioned footnotes. just as footnotes tell you where an author went to dig up his or her facts and quotations, so Google tells you where most people have gone before you in order to learn what you want to know.

For the last few years, Google and its competitors have heen at work on staggeringly ambitious projects, designed to transform the way in which all readers go about finding books. Even the scale of this enterprise is hard to fathom. A conservative estimate of the number of books published throughout history is 32 million: currently, though, Google believes that that there could be as many as 100 million. The company collaborates with publishersthere are currently some 10,000 of these so-called Google partners around the world-to provide information about books currently in print, including text samples, to all users of the Web. So do a number of rival companies. As Google, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble compete, the Web has become a vast and vivid online bookstore. Anyone with a laptop can scan dust jackets, read blurbs, and peek between the covers of the limited group ofbooks that can still be bought. Cambridge University Press, which became a partner in 2004, receives 500"000 page views a inonth from searchers who began at Google or Googi.(£o~ks. In other words, around two-thirds of all the potential customers for the books of the world's oldest publisher start at Go ogle rather than the press's own Web site. A second, even larger enterprise-the Google Library Project-has brought the company into collaboration with great libraries around the world. Drawing on the vast collections. of Stanford, Harvard, Michigan, the New York Public Library, and many others, Google is digitizing as many out-of-print books as possible. It is an extraordinary effort that Google itself describes as designed to "build a comprehensive index of all the books in the world." This index, moreover, will enable readers to sear.ch all the books it contains and to see full texts of all those n9t covered, by copyright. Google's book project is a twenty-firstcentury version ofFremont.R{der's pl.in, on steroids and in your face: a list of books that will ultimately be universal in scope, accessible everywhere, and accompanied by full texts. It is hard to exaggerate how much mate.rial is becoming accessible month by month and what will become ~!'cessible in the next few years, for those wh.; study the distant past or the Third World as well as those primarily concerned.with the presen.t. ·Google is flanked by other big efforts. Some are largely philanthropic, like·the old standby Projeet Gutenberg, which provides hand-keyboarded texts of English andAmencan classics, plain in appearance and easy to use, and the distinctive Million~ Book Project, founded by Raj Reddy at Carnegie Mellon University.

world to provide, among other things, online texts in many languagM for which character-recognition software is not yet available. Add in the hundreds of smaller efforts in specialized fields. Perseus, for ex· ample, an incredibly useful site based at Tufts, began with Greek and Latin texts and now embraces works from the English Renaissance. Readers can make direct online use of dictionaries, grammars, and commentaries as they struggle through the originals. There are also new commercial enterprises like Alexander Street, which offers libraries beautifully produced electronic collections of everything from "Harper's Weekly" to the letters and diaries of American immigrants. Even the biggest libraries are expanding faster and more vertiginously than Borges conld have dreamt, thanks to the electronic resources listed, at length, on their Web pages. It has already become impossible for ordin'9".J!..-~cholars to keep abreast of the basic sources onlinethough D-Lib Magazine, an online publication, helps by highlighting library Web pages that do an especially good job of organizing digital sources and collections, rather as material libraries used to advertise their acquisition of a writer's papers or a collection of hooks with fine bindings. Many librarians view these developme~ts with warm approval. Kristian Jensen is a ,dapper, hyperarticnlate curator of early printed books at the British Library, who worke_d with Microsoft. on a project, now abandoned, to digitize the library's immense holdings in nineteenth-century literature. His tlsual style is extremely .precise and sober,. but when he talks about the prospects of digital libraries, he lights up. "You can't help being enthusiastic," he says, at the thought of all this ";natenal becoming available to teachers and students at universiti~s and,·s.chools all over the world. One way to see what he means is to visit the Web site of the Online Computer Library Center and look at their WorldMap. This imaginative application plots numbers of books in public and academic systems around the world, country by country. Ask tlie WorldMap to show you. how many public library books the world's nations boast: you will· /;ee the. relati~n of the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, and of Western natiqns to their former colonies, all laid out in stark color. Sixty million Bdto;ms have 1!6 million public library books at their disposal, w:hile the more tlfan l.l billion Indians have 36 million." . World poverty, in other words, is embodied in lack of print as well as lack of food-it means that citizens of many natio~s do not have access. to their own literatore and .history, much less to information about other countries.

The Internet, as constituted in its short past, has not yet done much to r~, dress this imbalance. In 2005, when I sat in a tin-roofed, incandescently hut West African Internet cafe and tried to answer questions from my students In America, I could find little high-end material on the screen, and neither, by the look of things, could my Beninese fellow users. By now it would be possi· ble to find far more, and better, digital resources, even on a slow PC in Naititingou. As the capillary spread of electrification reaches smaller and smaller cities, as Internet cafes sprout in small Asian, Mrican, and Latin American towns, and as Goog!e and its rivals fill the Web with solid texts, the .. 11\ap of knowledge will undergo a metamorphosis. Capitalism, of all things, is \) democratizing access to books at an unprecedented pace. · Kazin loved the New York Public Library because it admitted everyone.

Ovenden, who works with Google at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, points out that the millions of books that will be digitized there are in some forty languages. Meanwhile, libraries on the Continent and elsewhere are signing Google partnership agreements of their own. The mass of old and new texts on the Web will not be an English-only zone. The Internet's technologies, moreover, are continually developing, and many of the changes make it easier for a user to take a stand in the flood of information and fish out exactly the right book or article from the foam. Consider the search function: the hunting-gathering-connecting of information that Go6gle ot Yahoo or Ask does on our behalf. In its first age, a search engine used,,a--~crawler"-actually a stationery entity-to look for relevant pages on a stored, and slighdy out-of-date, version of the Web. No two search engines gave exactly the same results, though Google regularly found more and more !-'sefulsites than its rivals, and this accomplishment won it placement as the sole engine of choice on many official Web pages. Even Google's crawler, though, remained as fixated on surfaces as a fashion photographer. It informed the user ouly about the Spercent or so of content prominendy labeled as ~uch on,the top layers of Web pages. To find materials buried in such deep bodies of fact and do7mnentas the Library of Congress's Web site or JSTOR (the vast repository of scholarly journal articles), you had to carry out gynamic, focused searches: by going to the site and asking a specific question, or hiring a specialist firm like Bright Planet to ask it thousands of times foryou. ~ In recent years, however, as-anyone who regularly uses Go ogle knows, the crawlers have become more-adept at asking questions, and the search companies haveapparendy induced the big proprietary sites to become more responsive to the crawlers' inquiries. Specialist engines like Google Scholar can discriminate with astonishing precision- between relevant and irrelevant, firsthand and <;Ierivative information.- Internet tools offer not just more information every day but also more effective ways of formulating precise iflquiries. One of my favorites is Amazon's list of "statistically improbable phrases," or SIPs, in.any given book.- Click on one of them and Amazon whisks you offto a list of other books in which the same highly unusual combination of words appears--a fast and_ simple y.tY to find connections that previous buyers have not already made.

the Web. But the powers of search keep growing, and it is hard to imagine what they will be in ten or twenty years. For all its virtues, the Google Library Project, in its present, working form, has received mixed reviews, and that is understandable. Google shows the reader a scanned version of the page. These are generally accurate and readable-though individual pages can be blurry or obscured, and scanner operators occasionally miss pages or scan them out of order. Sometimes the copy used is imperfect. In the spirit of the movie Office Space, at least one scholarly acquaintance has spotted a body part, scanned with the text. Other problems are more serious. Google uses optical character recognition to prodJice a second version, for use by its search engine, and this process has some quirkS. In a scriptorium lit by the sun, a scribe could mistakeuly transcribe a "u" as an "n," or vice versa. Curiously, the computer makes the same mistakes. If you enter "qualitas"-an important term in medieval philosophyin Google Book Search, you will find ahuost 2,000 appearances. But if you enter "qnalitas," a nonword, you will be rewarded with more than 600 references to ''qualitas" that you would not have found using the correct term. That is a lot of "qnalitas." If you want to get a sense of the full magnitude of the problem, call up the Google version ofa German book printed in the old spiky Jrpe, Fraktur, and ask to "view plain text"-the text used for search. In many cases, the system will show you page after page of gobbledygook. It seems sigfor both science and scholarship, "WISnificant that the Germarr word ·. .senschaft," often appears as' "Wrlferischaft" in these random text zones. It is hard to see how errors on this scale will ever be eliminated-any more than the thousands of errors made when the catalogues of the great university and public libraries were converted into databases will ever be corrected as a whole. Serious pro\>lems also affect the "metadata," or data about data, that · Google offers its users. The cataloguing information that identifies any given hem is often incomplete or confusing. Multivolmne works can be very hard to use, since Go ogle originally treated them as single items (this policy seems to have changed, perhaps in response to users' complaints: the hive mind at work). And the key terms that Google provides in order to characterize indi- . vidual books are sometimes unintentionally comic. It is not all that helpful, when you are thinking about how to use an old Baedeker guide to Paris, to be told randomly that one of its central concepts is "fauteuil." The possibilities for glitches, and the pretexts for grmnbling, are endless. Scholars, whose ·

interests are minutely precise and philological, inclined by disposition and experience to look on the dark side, often concentrate on these blemishes. HI It is true that, thanks to Google and its rivals, social and cultural historians work on the period from the mid-eighteenth to the early twentieth century already occupy a massive and growing intellectual sweet spot. Without ever leaving home, they can search for evidence about everything from political language to the rise of new technologies, in a database much larger than any historian has ever used before. Where details about editions matter less than sheer quantity of easijy accessible, generally reliable informationor where only a single, ninete~nth-century edition exists-digitization has already brought about a revolut(on. It is an amazing experience to teach liter, ary texts that you know well, but not pe~fectly, with the Google Books text up and searchable on your laptop. And it is more than transformative to sit in · your office at a small liberal arts or community college and call up, as you already can, thousands of books in dozens of languages, the nearest material copy of which is hundreds of miles away. Still, even the sweet spot has its sour patches. Though Google claims to make full texts available for all books not protected by copyright, in fact you "' cannot download or even read in full many of the out-of-copyright texts. The system allows you to see only the same three wavy li~ banners of text (pretty mum guaranteed na't t,<> CO,lltain the exact passage Y?U need) that it offers for books in copyright. Li\<e Erasmus,. Go ogle is bot'ri" generous and a fallible guide to the universe of books·', / An analogy may help to highlight Google's accomplishments and limitations. In the 1910s and 1920s1 Aichibald.CaryCo6lidge supervised the con' struction and organization .of Harvard University's Widener Library, the world's greatest collection of sqolarly books. Like the creators of Google, he worked on a grand scale, deliberately building collections not only of rare and famous works but ;$o o('Writfugs which are neither great nor fashionable," since these were essential for "background and filling in." Like them, too, he emphasized the need to make books as accessible as possible, both by creating a library large .enough to hold millions of them and by cataloguing them as rapidly as possible. Bnt Coolidge, as William Bentinck- · Smith recorded, "led a life of books. He was seldom without them. In his younger days he traveled aqoss Asia with a little trunkload of them," and in later years he read as he walked in the country." Accordingly, when Coolidge
~

306

set out to create a universal library, he did not simply start buying books by the ton. Instead, he searched the world for integral collections that would add new fields to Widener's holdings, systematically building resources for both present and future research. His directing intelligence, and those of the helpers and donors he inspired, played a vital role in making the Widener a uniquely efficient machine for scholarly work; its catalogues were as accurate as its holdings were comprehensive. The Google Library project aims to be genuinely universal, as no material library can, even the Widener. But it lacks the governing vision of a Coolidge, and accordingly operates less as a vast, coherent ordqing mechanism than as a gigantic fire hose dousing the world's readers with texts untouched by human hands or minds. Google could do much more for the world's readers if it invited Coolidge's modern counterparts-masters of both the virtual world of information and the sensuous, material world of real books--to plan and shape its virtual library. At present, th~ugh, no evidence suggests that Google sees the future of its enterprise in these terms. . In the end, moreover, general conditions set limits to what the Google project, along with its competitors, can acli.ieve, at least in the near term. The miCrofilm years showed that reproduction projects on a large scale are realized when undertaken by national inStl1::fitions determined to preserve a patrimony and malre it availal;>le; or by coJhpanies out to malre money. So far, the new Web companies have·moved'm~ faster, and uiJ.like the Bibliotheque Nationale, they have plumped fi>r making vast quantities of books available for other~ to sort and use, rather than for digitizing preselected, well known texts; But even Google's sleei.<, high-powered engines cannot pull books onto the Web any faster than the pots of money that fuel them will allow. In the end, Google will digitjze only as much as the relevant income stream allows-a point imderlined by Microsoft's recent decision to leave this field to Google. Th~t means that they are going to leave vast numbers of important books untouched. At every turn, technical and economiC problems confront Google and its rivals and limit their freedom of action. One of the most frequently discussed difficulties i.sthat of copyright. Google estimates, very roughly, that'between 5 and 10 percent of known books are currently in print. Twenty percent more-those produced between the beginning of print in the fifteenth century and 1923-are otit of copyright The remainder-perhaps 75 percent of

all books ever printed-are "orphans," still covered by the very long copyright protections currently in force in Europe and North America, but out of print and pretty much out of mind. Rather as the Alexandrian library confiscated scrolls fr6m ships, Google simply scans as many of these as it can, though it lacks legal permission to do so. But this part of the firm's project remains highly controversial. A number of the publishers who use Google to market their new books have sued to prevent Google from scanning books in copyright without o]>taining formal permission-a daunting prospect. For the moment, accordingly, Google is not making these works fully available, and a recent legal settlement only makes it possible to show larger portions of such books to Google users. Then, too, Google has no im,mediate plans to scan books from the first couple of centuries of printing. When asked why, computer people sometimes explain that the books' fragile condition makes them hard to scan. That is ridiculous: most early books are far less fragile, thanks to the fine rag paper on which they were printed and the glorious craft skills-of their makers, than the nineteenth-cen~ novels-'mass<produc<;d on wood pulp paper and now dried out and brittle-that Goilgie's scanners are capturing by the hundreds. The real reason is commercial ..Rare boo~eq!lire expensive special conditions for copying, and most of those likely to glmerate a lot of use have /, already been made available by companies like Chad\vyck-Healey and Gale. These descendants of the microtilm houses sell massive collections to libraries and universities, for substantial ·fees. Early English Books Online (EEBO) offers 100,000 titles printed between 1475 and 1700, 25,000 of them searchable. Ei~teenth Century'Collections Online provides searchable full texts of around 150,000 books-33 million pages' worth. Massive tomes in Latin and the little pamphle;ts that poured <)ff the presses during the Puritan revolution, schoolbooks, Jaoobean tragedies with prompters' notes, and political pamphlets by wild-eyed Diggers are all available in their original form to any main library user in New York or London, Syracuse or Sydney. Google will not directly explore this territory. Other vast and viial sectors of·the world;s book production are neither catalogued nor accessible on site, much less available for digitization.

with cash flow. One possible outcome of the current race to digitize, then, is a new version of the existing imbalances between north and south, former metropoles and former colonies. The book-deprived inhabitants of subSaharan Africa aud much of India may be able to read Western works of every kind on screen. It is far less certain that they will be able to find and read texts in their own languages. Whatever happens on screen, the great libraries of the Northern Hemisphere will remain irreplaceable for a long time. One of the best things com' puterization will do for everyone is simply to pinpoint the location of the books people need. Astonishingly, for all the hundreds of millions of books in American college ·and university libraries, there are normally no more than five copies of any given book in a language other than English. Google has always described itself as a company that shows users the way to find the information they need, not as the primary provider of that information. In the carefully chosen words of Jim Gerber, director of Content Partnerships, "We · want to make sure readers can find books." The company does this job very well-and we would be·foolish to expect its managers to take on further tasks for no extra compensation. · A record of all history"appears \"'en more distant.

In practice, the two categodes blur, andalways have. All great libraries contain lots of documents. Most archives haye working libraries; some of them very large and valuable. The point to keep in mind'is that if you plan to make the whole record of human experience avagable, as the ;,ost utopian champions of digitization imagine, you have to render both kinds of collection accessible online.

at everything from digitizing the papers of major thinkers like Hannah Arendt to collecting sound and video materials systematically and making them available as well. Its Web site is already a magnificent archive open to the world. Meanwhile, individual curiosity and passion have driven the creation of virtual archives on every imaginable subject, often unconnected with any material collection. The Web can transport you to documents on sages from Thomas and Jane Welch Carlyle to Edward Said, to vast runs of reproduced political poems and cartoons, and even into the recondite field that I cultivate: the Latin writing of the Renaissance (try the Web sites "White Trash . Scriptorium" and "Philological Museum"; both are indispensable). 20 . But even the biggest of these projects is nothing more than a flare of light . in the vast and -.still unexplore\1 night sky of humanity's documented past. The Archive of the Indies in Simancas, a magnificent product of the Spanish · monarchy's obsession with record keeping, possesses an estimated 86 million pages' worth of documents. With the help of IBM, it has now .digitized more than 10 million of these. Scholars and students who go to Simancas can do much of their work on screen, saving the originals and their eyesight at one and the same time. But they cannot search or aocess these pages from abroad. ArchivesUSA, a Web-based kuide to Americ'an archives, lists S,SOO·repositories and more than'160,000 collections of primary source material. The Na-' . tional Archives alone contain sonfe'fl.ine billion ·items. It is not likely that we will see the whole archives of tho/ United States online in the immediate _) rV" futnre-much less those of poo;<:r nations. The supposed nniversallibnrry,then, and its companion universal archive, will not be a seamless mass ofbooks, easily linked and studied together, but a patchwork ot different interfaces and databases, some open to anyone with a computer arid WiFi, others closed to those who lack access or money. The real challenge.now is how to chart the tectonic plates of infm;mation that are crashing irito .one another and then to learn to navigate the new landscapes they are creating. Blaise Agnera y Areas, until recently an architect at Microsoft Live Labs and a pioneer in computer-assisted bibliography (full disclosure: he took courses with me years _ago at Princeton), suggests that the best way to think about the masses of material that are being gathered on the Web is to divide them in two. One of them is a library and cultural archive of the present. Go ogle and its competitors have already gathered collections far more massive than anything

.

the world has known-collections of the books published and the music, art, and film produced after 1990 or so. Though these companies would all disclaim any ambition to serve as the world's repositories, that is what they have pecome. Each of them holds a sea of data, of books that have been captured and made searchable, of images and tunes-all of it washing around
in multiple, redundant servers, constantly moving, continually refreshed. Over time, as more of this material emerges from protection and becomes

accessible-and it will-we will be able to learn things about our culture, in the present, which we could never have known in the past. We will still be able to read books and scrutinize images as we always have, but we will also be able to interrogate this whole mass of material in new ways, using the same applied mathematical techniques that the National Security Agency uses to mine data from our telephone calls and e-mails. Soon the present will become overwhelmingly accessible. It is a thrilling prospect, but it has some scary implications. Readers and lovers of music and the arts already attend more to the present than the past. And the second great wodge of material-the great messy assemblage of sources for earlier periods, some complete but many partial, some open to all and others for profit, that is now taking shape-will not, in the foreseeable future, coalesce into a single, accessible database. Nj'ither Google nor anyone else will fuse the proprietary collectipns of early books and the local systems created by in~ dividtlal archives into a .single accessible mass of information. Though the distant past will also be more accessible than ever before, in a technical sense, once it is capfured artll.preserved as a vast, disjointed mosaic, it may actually recede ever more rapidly from our collective attention. We will still need our material libraries and archives. In some ways, we have come to understand better than ever before in the last twenty years or so just what makes old-fashioned, bricks-and mortar collections essential and distinctive. Historians, literary scholars, and librarians have realized, in the words ofJohn Seely Brown and Paul Duguid, that information leads a "social · . life" of its OWn. The form in which you eneounter a text can have a huge im" pact on how you use it. Take the simplest case: If you want to make people pelieve that a given official document-say, a letter from the commanding officer of a young Texan in the Air National Guard-is genuiri.e, you cannot just give people its wording.You have to show that it is on the right sort of pap~r, entered in the standard form, and type<! on the proper Selectric. The

only way to know that for certain is to see the original and compare it to others, and in most cases, you can do that only in an archive where they are reliably stored. As scanning technology improves, watermarks and other vital signs are becoming more accessible to remote users. But scholarly or even forensic exactitude still requires direct consultation of original documents. Original documents and books reward us for taking the trouble to find them by telling us things no im3.ge can. Duguid describes watching a fellow historian systematically sniff 250-year-old letters in an archive. By detecting the smell of vinegar-which had been sprinkled on letters from towns struck by cholera in the eighteenth century, in the hope of disinfecting them-he could trace the history of disease outbreaks. 21 Historians of the book, a new and growing tribe, /ead books as scouts read trails. Bindings-custom made, for the most part, in the early centuries of printing-can tell you who owned them and what level of society they belonged to. Marginal annotationswhich abounded in the centuries when readers habitually went through books pen in hand-identify the often surprising messages that individuals have found as they read. Many original writers and thinkers-Martin Luther, Hester Thrale Piozzi, John Adams, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge-filled their books with notes that are indispensable to understanding their thought. Thousands of forgotten men and women covered Bibles and prayer books, recipe collections'and political pamphlets with pointing hands, underlining, and notes that give deep insight into what their books meant to them-and how they cooked their meals, treated their illnesSes, and said their prayers. 1... ., · ' Ifyou wantto cap~ how a giveli )>ook was packaged and what it has meant to the readers who have~wrapped it, as many scholars now do, you have to ' look notjust at all the editions'h~t also at all the copies you can find, from original manuscripts to cheap reprints. The databases include multiple copies of some titles, l>ut they will never provide all the copies of, say, Adam Smith's _The Wi!alth Nations and the early responses it provoked. Sometimes, too, the processes that hav: turned material books into electronic texts have stripped them of the rich_ evidence that their original form could provtde. The texts available on EEBO; for example, were not scanned from the originals, but from microfilms. Their bindings are not reproduqd, and it is hard to be sure of their original sizes---:.two densely material sets of dues thatscholars constantly use, when working out who read, or was expected to read, a given book.

As companies compete for pole position, market share, and what the neers of the Dot Bomb laughingly called "first mover advantage," they are vising new projects with all the imaginative verve of Fremont Rider. Some these call to mind the effort of the 1960s and 1970s to put everything on crofilm, which did a lot of harm as well as a great deal of good, because ' creators and managers ignored the social life of information.

R. R. Bowker, a company baS<d in New Providence, N""" Jersey, ' ~- ·-~ compiles what was once a book and is now a database, Books in Print.

once have been spent on traditional media. Nonetheless, every year the library adds more than a mile of new printed materials to its collection. This mass of print enters the building dynamically, like a battering ram made of paper and buckram. It forces older materials-often rare and valuable-into storage and destroys the traditional order of the collections, which served scholars for generations as a spatially defined memory theater. Like the sorcerer's apprentice, administrators and professors have conjured up so many active young scholars writing theses, articles, and books that they threaten to overwhelm libraries, and the faithful guardians of the knowledge base with them. Journals pose even harder problems. In theory, scholarly and scientific periodicals offer the newest data and hypotheses-the very things that scholars need most urgently. But their subscription prices have risen starkly. Elsevier, said to be the world's-largest for-profit scientific publisher, claims to serve "a global scholarly community of 7,000 journal editors, 70,000 editorial board members, 300,000 reviewers, and 600,000 authors." It charges as much as $21,744 per year for one of its periodicals, Brain Research~more than any but the very richest libraries can possibly afford. And, of course, cataloguing, binding, and finding space for this pullulating mass of new print are formidably expensive. True, new databases offer direct access to thousands of articles. A..sc~olar in the humanities can rummage ~rough older articles in more than .§00 arts, humanities, and social sciences journals without ever leaving his or her aesk, thanks to JS~OR. Project Muse, a second nonprofit collaboration based at Johns Hopkins Unj~rsity Press, offers full-text access to cur' rent and' recent-ru;!i&s fr<;>.m alniost 400 leading journals.

with justice, that for-profit journals guard the gates to the kingdom of scientific research paid for by public funds, and earn massive profits by doing so. Many argue that all scholarly and scientific journals--and all university presses-should provide free full-text access to their materials to all. In the case of medical research, Congress has mandated that all80,000 papers produced every year under the sponsorship of the National Institutes of Health be placed on an open federal database, PubMed, once a year has passed from the date of publication. The Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences has gone even further. It has decided that all members of the faculty should post all of their work on an open Harvard Web page. Editors who hope to publish the work of Harvard professors will simply have to accept that a version of the piece in question is already · availab!l'' to the whole world, or allow the professor to post a PDF file of the work as edited and typeset for their journal. I cannot speak for journals or editors in the sciences. But I do serve as one.offour editors of the Journal of the History of Ideas, now in its sixty-ninth year of operation. My colleagues and I receive around 200 articles a year for consideration. Two of us read each one, and 'those 'that we find original and scholarly are then submitted to further scrutiny by two specialists--Qr three, if the first two disagree.

CODEX IN CRISIS

Web has created a fantastic new public sphere-and a fantastic new mass of ungainly, misspelled prose. Editors ask writers to take a second and a third look at what they have written-to clarify, polish, and correct. We form a thinlipped gray line, protecting both readers and authors from first thoughts. And this job is more important than ever, now that scholars inhabit an environment that enables them to write on the basis of what the sociologist Andrew Abbott calls "on-time" research-that is to say, snatch-and-grab raids into what is online, carried out in the course of composition-rather than the decks of neadywritten file cards that they would have compiled fifty years ago. 24 Harvard's sweeping solution to the problems faced by libraries and students may have good results in some fields. But in the humanities, satisfying the demand · that every article become immediately accessible on the Web for free will force us to abandon valuable forms and standards. In this new world, journals will become something like blogs with footnotes: unedited texts, glittering with · insights, but also bleutished with errors that no informed eye has picked up, and succeeded by angry, scatological discussion threads. The world of humanistic scholarship needs updating, but it does not need to be transformed ·into one more province of the public sphere that already exists, and serves ( quite different needs, on the Web. ~. 'some of the strongest advocates for digitization seem to welcome this out~pme--or at least the transformation of prose forms that it would bring about. Gregory Crane, the creator of Perseus, evokes a future in which scholars cast all their information not in the traditional forms of nonfictional writing-the article and the book-but 4t smaller, "granular" units that can be combined and rea;inbllied by Web users in an infinite number of ways. Kristian )ensen of the British Library agrees that this may come about. When you.writeJor the Web, he points ,out, you naturallytend·to cast your thoughts in little textual monads rather than in the traditional linear forms. Unlike Crane, though, Jensen is concerned about the result:Thdlow of texts onto the Web, Jensen worries, may be accompanied by--or even help to cause-a revolution in forms of attention that will harm, or even eliutinate, traditional forms of argument and writingc As the railroad threatened the cathedral, the intellectual snack pack threatens slow food. It is not yet clear that online publication will transform writiug as radically as Crane and Jensen suggest. Critics and true believers converge in emphasizing one feature of Web publication above all: its new form. The traditional

Votaries urge the reader to give up the crutches of traditional plot and argument in favor of the self-plotted curves and swoops of this new form of reading. They emphasize that the protean text of the Web, which may change hour by hour as a political crisis unrolls or a hurricane is tracked, fits the conditions of modetn life, with its lack of stable beliefs and even of stable human selves. Similarly, they argue that Web sites-which can be dipped into freely fur one article or image, and which encourage back talk from their readers-fit the dispersed nature of modern life better than stable print media. Others note that this new form of reading is not only dynamic but also interactive. Writers can count the number of hits an article receives on a Web page; readers can use an author's name, laid out in hypertext, to send an e-mail response. Discussion strings make it possible for all involved to carry on elaborate debates about a provocative colu~ or review. At their most intense, these discus$ions metamorphosize into a n~'w kind of reading and writing community--all of whose members exert pr~sure on the choice and treatment of topi~, making the Web site itself in, yractive. Thus, Talking PointsJ-.feniq (TPM), a liberal political site. run by J~sh · Marsliall, employs several rep~t;ters, but also depends on local mformation sent in by readers around the co!rntry. During Hurricane Katrina, readers who worked for the federal governmertt, tracking climate and weather conditions, provided TPM with a level of precision and expertise in reporting that no newspaper or btoadcast news service could match. -'-Critics, by-contrast, heap obloquy on many features of these new textsfr~in the fact that some of them overemphasize design, ,while their words a~~ often transcribed from out-of-copyright sources or. compiled by out-ofwork "content providers," to the ubiquitous presence of bright marginal strips of advertising~.

tiny communities based on the Web will undermine the larger social community in which we all live. Votaries and critics alike exaggerate the novelty of the changes the Web has wrought. The new media of the decades around !900 transformed the presentation of texts just as radically as the Web has. Newspapers appeared regularly in multiple editions, rapidly bringing headline stories up to date. In Berlin, by the end of the nineteenth century, one of the major papers could be printed, packed, and on its way to distribution within eighteen minutes after news reached the central office. The existence of several editions each day meant that the newspaper <:ould follow a breaking story-like the hunt for an escaped murderer--stage by stage. Sometimes, of course, editors themselves promoted, or even created, stories of this kind. The Berliner Zeitung sent a reporter through the city, for example, while urging readers to try to catch him-an efferuve way to galvanize readers' interest and commitment, brilliandy evoked by Graham Greene in Brighton Rock. Kiosks, pillars, and cafes made each new edition available to readers. The city itself spoke, as Peter Fritzsche has shown, spewing an endless stream of stories and sense impressions over its inhabitants.25 Magazines, naturally, were not as protean as newspapers: their content was r fixed in each weeldy or monthly edition. But their massive advertising rev. · enue and longer leag.;time enabled them to experiment with even more varied ways of presenting text and advertisement. Editors self-consciously tried to make them into coherent works of art: not uninterrupted blocks of type, but artful combinations of word and image. William Dean Howells, describing'the creation of a fictional magazine, Every Other Week, in his 1890 novel A Hamrd of New Fortunes, showed the editor and owner realizing that they must hire an art director. He, in turn, commissioned what Howells calls "graphlcal comments" appropriate to each sto~y.. Eventually, the Gesamtkunstwerk of the American magazine adopted a particular, co[llll1ercial form. Publishers learned that they could cut subscription and newsstand prices radically, so long as they sold enough ads to recoup the loss they made on every copy of their magazine. Richard Ohmann and others have shown that as advertising itself became more professional, editors offered to work with advertisers and the makers of products, turning their magazines into magasins in the French sense: colleruons of attractive products, some to be read and others to be bought, rather like the Sears catalogue of the

same period. They encouraged readers to take a serious interest in advertising by running contests for new slogans, producing series of advertising collections that could be removed from the magazines and collected in albums, and even allowing writers to mention particular products, favorably, in their stories. Most important, the form of the magazine mutated, as editors introduced the new practice of "ad-streaming." Like Web sites, magazines used advertising to generate their income stream, they adopted as their standard form a long ribbon of text that unrolled between colorful ads, and they demanded that readers develop new skills. . The experienced reader soon learned how to consume each magazine: not in a sin!l'e, uniform way, like the old, learned quarterlies, which had confronted readers with immense blocks of text, but as a collection of materials useable for different purposes. Early in the 1950s, a New Yorker reader wrote · in to the magazine that each copy was "as efficiently used up around here as the packing plants' claim for their pork. The covers go in an art scrap book, cartoon,s & quips clipped and sent to a brother in Korea, & the fiction & book .. ' reviews( are passeled out among less fortunate acquaintances who have eame~y good will."26 Some _critics deplored the· fact that illustrated newspapefs and magazines, designed for a world in which "the rhythm of life pounds short and hard," did not foster the "tranquil and concentrated focus" 'and "surrender" demanded of the true reader. They noted querulously that ' the new emphasis on visuarinformation was designed to give a magazine "impact" in a life too hectic to allow the .individuals to read (both remarks were made by German critics in the1920s, lamenting the Americanization of German magatine cuitore.) The oddly familiar language of these critiques remihds us that our media landscape retains, and will retain, elements that wct\J.ld . have been . familiar generations ago. , ';f,he newspapers and magazines of the early years of the century did not have the near-total flexibility of the modern Web site, and their readers could not skip from one hot link to the next. But their mixture of commerce and culture, fueir juxtapositions of serious and trivial contents, and their ~bility to confront readers with the shock of the new were as wid~ly. noticed-and sometimes as forcefully deplored-by contemporaries as the similar features of the.Web. Like the Web, too, the new magazines and newspapers invited their readers to see themselves as members ofa single community. The evidence suggests that they often succeeded. Readership

320

surveys collected information about audience response; readers'
identified particular stories and articles as controversial or rewarding;

readers of magazines as diverse as the Saturday Evening Post and the Yorker professed that they kept their subscriptions because-as wrote to the latter-it says "what I think and feel"; "It has to be good because we agree with everything you say." Those who sent in such sages, as a study of the New Yorker by Mary Corey has established, in<:luc1eel
a bird curator at a museum, a UN official, an editor, doctors, enlisted men,

a British war bride and a former chorus boy-about as diverse a group as have ever shared any serious interest." In some ways, the world ofwriitina has not so much been transformed as restored to a ghostly, faster-m1oving< simulacrum of the media world of half a century ago. By contrast, the world of serious reading does seem to be changing, in related ways. As readers gain private, off-site access to treasures once fined to the British and New York Public Libraries, they may stay home in : their -pajamas rather than schlepping in; like the hard-pressed content providers in George Gissing's New Grub Stree~ to the Valley of the 'Shadow of the Book. Even in the great years of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century metropolitan library, after all,. the greatest scholars-the historian Leopold von: Ranke, for ~ample, or the social scientist Werner Sombart-did most of their work in their-own enormous collections. In Berlin, where great profes· .· sors were public figures, ricbly paid, these might contain as many as 30,000 books. It is hard to feel anything but pleasure at the thought that Google may enable impoverished graduate students to emulate the mandarins ofyesterday, and work where they like. Yet great city and university libraries have long been America's symbolic centers of culture-the nurseries of Kazins and Hofstadters. Traditionally, they have occnpied the grandest of publis buildings---m~terial, ·public testimony to the powers of the book. Pursuing one's studies in an environment like this was a way of learning an artisanal craft. Librarians, older scholars, and graduate students passed on informal advice. The librai:y's own ways of collecting information--'like the magnificent subject cards. in the old New York Public Library catalogue---rlirected the reader to extraordinary finds. And a sighting of a celebrity like Frank Manuel or Barbara Tnchman could leave a young student vibrating for weeks with the sense that hard work ·might lift bne from the Valley of the "Shadow to Parriassus.

A number of great American cities have recently built big central librarleB, range in style from neo-Beaux-Arts celebrations of the traditional cui· of the book to bright, glassy, open civic centers. And as Witold Rybczyn· ·pointed out in a recent "slide-show essay" in Slate, the heavy facades and elegant, sterile reading rooms of the libraries in Chicago and San Francisco seem to be crying out "Books still matter! Conan the Librarian is still in charge!" to a public that shows little interest. By contrast, the newer libraries in Seattle and Kansas City are hip, appealing structures that deliberately de'part from tradition. Rem Koolhaas did not even equip his ziggurat in Seattle with a reading room. These buildings pull in crowds composed of everyone, from graduate students to tourists to homeless people." The lesson Rybczynski draws is simple. Books have probably passed their sell-by date, as some prophets claim. Libraries, as such, are dinosaurs, doomed to elClinction. But build a really attractive building and call it a centrallibrary-a mall with natura! light, interesting spaces, and a comic book shop, like the new library in Salt Lake City-and the punters will come. Not for the books, but for the !'J'citement and the human connections tbat only a great public space can generate. Libraries, in otb<;r words, can survive. But if they insist on their original mis~ion, they will turn into enormous, handsome ghost ships, sailing along with..al!lights on and no passengers. On the other hand, if administrators decide_ that they can save libraries by sweeping all their dusty, old-fashioned books into off-site storage and filling their cavernous, loftlike spaces with the cafes and fast computers that might woo the crowds back, these treasure. houses will degenerate into bigger versions of Starbucks or Barnes & Noble: splendid public spaces that people frequent to use electronic sources,-most of whic:!t they could lind anywhere: Neither fate seems desirable: and neither will restqre the old function of the library as a training center for the crafts of scholarship. I As the books head for off-site warehouses, moreover, reading itself seems · to be under threat. Th~ neWspapers and magazines of the years around 1900 coexisted with more stable forms of writing-above all the serious book~ . and presupposed the superiority of engaged, informed study of texts even when they did not promote it. By contrast, the hot link and the search engine· seem to symbolize a particular postmodern way of approaching texts: rapid, superficial, appropriative, and individualistic. Readers do not need to master catalogues, to walk stacks, to use bibliographies---much less to work

322

'.

through stacks of books. All they need to do is enter a word or two into Google and compile the results. Some fear that the old-fashioned scholar's memory, stored with texts not only read, but digested and turned into marrow and bone, and the old-fashioned reader's deep play with novels and poetry studied for years, have given way to endless bricolage, mosaics assembled by students and writers who know only the bits of texts they pull from the screen. Listen, for example, to Jonathan Barnes, a specialist on ancient philosophy, describe what the computer database of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG)-a searchable, full-text archive of ancient Greek texts-has done for his field: Load it into your laptop, and you have instant access to virtually the whole ·of Greek literature. You cut and paste snippets from authors whose very names mean nothing to you. You affirm-and you're right-that a particular word used here by Plato occurs 43 times elsewhere in Greek literature. And you c..;, write an article-or a bookstuffed. with prodigious learning. (There are similar things available for Latin.) . :. The TLG is a lovely little 'resource (I think that's the word) and I use her all tl:te time. But she's strumpet-tongued: she flatters and she deceives. "what an enormous knowledge you have, my young cock-why not )enne make a real .scholar of you?" And the young cock crows on his dung-hill: he can cite anything and construe nothing." Barnes's. description of the siren song of the TLG will bring no pleasure to anyone who spends time, for example, grading papers or evaluating the work ofyoung writers. The 200,000 titles compiled by a single entrepreneur, Philip Parker, with the aid of algorithms and a staff of programmers, offer a preview of an~gly future. The shortcuts Barnes describes so witheringly are not confined to classics: in fact, they represent one version of what looks like a period style of approaching text. A report recently conimissioned by the British Library and the Joint Information Systems Committee details the reading practices of contemporary university students, using data drawn from actual search strings. Most students begin their searches for information at Google, rather than a library Web page that lists more refined search engines. Those who consult e-book sites stay on them for an average of four minutes. True,

, .The Book Dematerializes

323

students who consult e-journals stay longer: eight minutes) on average. But

around 60 percent of them look at no more than three pages of the article in question, and the majority never return to the site. The reading that most students do on the Web takes the form of "dipping," "cross-checking," and "power skimming"-just as the traditionalists croak.

Future Reading For now and for the foreseeable future, any serious reader will have to know how to travel down two very different roads simultaneously, No one should avoid the broad, smooth, and open road that leads through the screen into an electronic paradise of texts and images. But if you want to know what one of Coleridge's annotated books or an early "Spiderman" comic really looks and , feels }ike, or if you just want to read one of those_ millions of books that are being digitized but cannot as yet be opened and read-you still have to do it the old way, and you will have to for decades to come. At Kazin's beloved New York Public Library, the staff loves electronic media. The library has · made hundreds of thousands of images from its collections ac<:essible on the Web, and Google is digitizing more ·than a million ~ooks from the stacks. Still, the library has done all ihis in the knowledge that its collections comprise 53 million items. To ensure that as many of these as possible find users, it must keep bums on pews and books and documents in front of readers. When Paul Holdengraber, the. ambassador to New York from the lost realms· of European learning, organizes sellout events at Live from the New York Public Library, which thousands more hear as podcasts; or David Ferrerio, who runs the library system day to day, opens Central Branch for the first time to children, they have ""any ends in vie'Y· One is to provide the electronic media that New Yorkers need, in a setting that is no!;_ only disciplined and peaceful, but welcoming. Another, and no less important, is to keep the books and manuscripts alive ·by continuing to forge a. democratic public that will come to them. Sit in your local coffee shop and your laptop can tell you a lot, especially if you wield your search terms adeptly. But if you want deeper, more local knowledge, you will still have to take the narrower path-that leads between the lions and up the stone stairs. There-as in great libraries around the worldyou will use all the new sources, all the time. You will check musicians' names

324

and dates at Grove Music Online, read Marlowe's Doctor Faustus on Google Books or EEBO, or savor the idiosyncrasies of British justice as exhibited in the online proceedings of the Old Bailey. But these streams of data, rich as they are, will illuminate rather than eliminate the unique books and prints and manuscripts that only the library can put in front of you. For now, and for the foreseeable future, if you want to piece together the richest possible mosaic of documents and texts and images, you will have to do it in those crowded public rooms where sunlight gleams on varnished tables, as it has for more than a century, and knowledge is still embodied in millions of dusty, crumbling, smelly, irreplaceable manuscripts and books.
