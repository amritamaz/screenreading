Redefining Reading: The Impact of Digital Communication Media
It's not a book. It doesn't have a smell, you don't touch it . . . , you're plugged into the internet, you can't concentrate, it hurts your eyes, and you lose the beauty of the words behind this screen. Life itself is in hard copy. . . . Not this treacherous digitalism which has permeated our lives and our reality. --Respondent to survey comparing on-screen with hard-copy reading

EACH NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY BE JANUS-FACED, POTENTIALLY IMPROVING AND DEGRADING THE HUMAN CONDITION. THE STEAM ENGINE made industrial products cheaper and more diverse but contributed to the exploitation of child labor and proliferation of squalid urban living conditions. he automobile makes transportation more convenient but pollutes and leads to countless highway deaths. Calculators let anyone perform feats of math but have weakened basic arithmetic skills. A related conundrum holds true for technologies of the written word. he printing press helped spread literacy but shook the foundations of the Catholic Church. Word processing enabled the Japanese to generate text without producing each kanji stroke by stroke, but now many Japanese ind themselves forgetting the stroke order. he spelling checkers in word-processing programs monitor typographical errors but dampen motivation to master spelling. Information and communication technologies have generated new platforms on which to read. he list includes desktop and laptop computers, e-readers (such as the Kindle and Nook), tablet computers (e.g., the iPad), and handheld devices (e.g., the iPod Touch, mobile phones). But does reading on these devices difer from reading in hard copy? If so, does our growing dependence on reading onscreen contribute to a redeinition of what it means to read? What Does It Mean to Read? Just as text can designate many things (Paradise Lost, a soup can label, a traic sign), so can reading. First, what kind of reading materials do we have in mind?

newspaper articles, novels, and religious works (rather than, e.g., news headlines or tweets). Next, how do we approach text? Do we read linearly (from start to inish), or do we seek out snippets (using a table of contents, an index, or the "Find" function for searching an online text)? Do we skim or engage in "deep" reading (Wolf and Barzillai)? Do we read quickly or slowly? Answers to these questions are oten shaped by the character of the text. Is the material familiar or new to the reader? How complex are the words, the syntax, and the concepts? Functionality is also a consideration in deining reading (reading for information, for conceptual understanding, for enjoyment, or to kill time), as is the physical medium (a scroll, a paperback, an iPhone). Reading is, of course, just half of literacy. he other half is writing. Historically, ability to read has not always implied ability to write--or vice versa (Baron, Alphabet 81­82). However, in modern times, when we speak of people being literate, we generally mean readers who possess at least some writing skills. hese skills may be used not only in producing original text but also in annotating what others have written or in copying out passages of existing texts. Writing has commonly accompanied the act of reading. Reader markings appear in all sorts of texts (Caxton Club; Jackson), from marginalia in the Gutenberg Bible to underlining in a literature professor's well-worn copy of a Jane Austen novel. Written accompaniment to this act of reading can ill various roles. he simplest is to make parts of a text prominent (by underlining, highlighting, or adding asterisks, lines, or squiggles). More-reflective responses are notes written in the margins or in an external location--a notebook or a computer file. For many contemporary readers, textual annotation remains integral to reading. User Perspectives on Reading A burgeoning literature is considering how using the Internet may be afecting cognitive

activity (e.g., Carr; Cull; Greenield; Small and Vorgan). he work draws evidence from a variety of sources, including neurological imaging and objective performance on cognitive tasks. Some studies directly address reading on-screen. Jakob Nielsen has reported that "people rarely read Web pages word by word." Investigators at University College London, examining how users interact with online research sites, concluded that "users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of `reading' are emerging as users `power browse' horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense" (Information Behaviour 10). While the graduate students studied by Ziming Liu turned irst to a library's onlineinformation resources or the Web for help in completing assignments, 80% of them "always" or "frequently" printed out electronic documents (586, 587). Professional writers such as Nicholson Baker, Alan Jacobs, and David Ulin have weighed in on how reading on digital media compares with reading in hard copy (the general consensus being that e-readers are somewhat clunky but may provide a platform for uninterrupted reading of longer texts). However, it is also important to hear the voices of ordinary readers, especially those of university students--the irst generation of "digital natives." herefore, in fall 2010 and fall 2011, I investigated users' perspectives on the difference between reading in hard copy and reading on digital platforms. Study 1 he initial study involved 82 undergraduates (aged eighteen to twenty-four) at a midsize private university in the United States. Using a questionnaire mounted on SurveyMonkey (a commercial online survey instrument), participants were asked such questions as

how oten ("most of the time," "sometimes," "occasionally," "never") they annotated their textbooks by highlighting or underlining words or making notes in the books. In addition, open- ended questions probed what students liked most (and least) about reading on-screen and in hard copy. Finally, subjects were invited to ofer further comments. We look here at the results most relevant to the present discussion.1
OWNERSHIP AND ANNOTATION OF TEXTBOOKS

then printed it out. When asked whether they were more likely to read an assigned article if it was available online or if they were handed a copy, 6% said "available online," while 56% chose "handed a copy." (The other 38% declared it made no diference.)
COGNITIVE AND USABILITY ISSUES

Several questions addressed students' relationships with their textbooks. We found that 61% of the students sold their textbooks at the end of the semester "most of the time," 51% were renting hard copies of some of their textbooks, and 48% indicated that they annotated their textbooks only "occasionally" or "never." Given that more than half the students were disposing of their books at the end of the semester, there is a certain logic to not annotating them.
PREFERRED MODE FOR READING

Another series of questions examined students' preferred platforms for reading diferent genres (such as serious noniction, light iction, newspapers), either for academic purposes or for pleasure. Except for academic journals and newspapers, students overwhelmingly preferred to read texts in hard copy rather than online. (Of relevance is that the university had recently moved its boundjournal collection of-site, necessitating reliance on electronic journals.)
DOING ASSIGNED READING

Two questions probed how students approached reading assignments. When asked which platform they preferred if academic reading materials were available online, 55% favored reading the assignment online. However, 39% indicated they usually printed out the material and then read it, while another 6% noted they read the material online and

he survey explored students' level of engagement with reading materials, along with cognitive outcomes. When asked whether they reread academic materials, 49% said "occasionally" and 10% said "never." These selfreports are consistent with the earlier inding that 48% only "occasionally" or "never" wrote in their textbooks, since annotations typically facilitate reviewing a text that has already been read. However, when asked if they were more likely to reread academic materials available in hard copy or on-screen, 66% selected hard copy, compared with only 24% who chose on-screen. (The other 10% indicated they didn't reread.) When students were asked how their memory of what they read on-screen compared with their memory of what they read in hard copy, 46% indicated the medium didn't matter, 51% reported they had better memory for material read in hard copy, and only 2% said they retained more of what they read on-screen. Even more telling were subjects' responses regarding multitasking: 90% replied they were likely to multitask when reading on-screen, compared with only 1% when reading in hard copy. (he other 9% said they were equally likely to multitask when reading in either mode.) Cognitive and pedagogical issues also surfaced in the open-ended questions about what subjects liked most (and least) about reading in each medium. When asked what they liked least about reading on-screen, 91% complained about something cognitive ("I get distracted," "I don't absorb as much"). Similarly, when asked what they liked most about reading in hard copy, 78% of the responses

involved cognition or usability (it is "necessary for focus," "I can write in it").
RESOURCE ISSUES

In their "like most"/"like least" responses, some students volunteered sentiments relating either to ecological resources (what they liked least about reading in hard copy was that it "kills trees") or to money (by reading on-screen, you "don't have to pay to print stuf out"). However, in their comments at the end of the survey, several students acknowledged personal conlicts in choosing between reading platforms ("I prefer hard copies, but think they're bad for the environment," "I know it's a waste of paper, but I really prefer reading a physical book or article to reading it online").
PHYSICALITY OF THE BOOK

While many survey questions explored the physical venues in which respondents read on diferent platforms (standing at a bus stop, sitting in a cofee shop), I focus here on responses relating to cognition and to emotion, aesthetics, and physicality.
COGNITION

Subjects were asked which platform in the following pairs made it easier to concentrate on reading. he responses of the 203 students show clear trends, although only 26 students, or 13%, owned tablets, and 43 students, or 22%, owned e-readers: Hard copy Tablet computer Hard copy E-reader Tablet computer Desktop or laptop computer E-reader Desktop or laptop computer E-reader Tablet computer 90% 10% 67% 33% 68% 32% 78% 22% 64% 36%

Finally, 10% of the subjects indicated that what they liked most about reading in hard copy involved the physicality of books. Among their responses were "having a tangible copy of the text" and "tactile interaction with reading material." he desire for a tangible, tactile relationship with reading material is relected in the fact that many subjects printed out online materials, before or ater reading them. Study 2 The second study compared reading on a variety of digital devices, but it also asked about reading in hard copy by way of comparison. he study was intended to survey a broad spectrum of users (college age and up, from a variety of occupations), though most responses (203 of 296) were from eighteento-twenty-four-year-olds, 192 of whom were students. Ten other students were between twenty-five and thirty-five and 1 between thirty-six and fifty, making a total student population of 203. Using e-mail and Facebook, we recruited subjects to complete a SurveyMonkey questionnaire.2

The perceived advantage of hard copy (over tablet or e-reader) for concentration is not surprising, given results from the irst study indicating preference for reading in hard copy. he students' perceptions that they concentrate better when they read on a tablet than when they read on a desktop or laptop computer likely relect their risk of succumbing to easily accessible online temptations when they use traditional networked computers. (Two-thirds of the student tablet owners indicated they purchased the device primarily for reading.) E-readers, which at the time typically lacked general-purpose Internet connectivity, were seen as posing fewer challenges to concentration than traditional computers or tablets. Cognitive issues were also on the minds of subjects in the second study as they responded to the open-ended questions: what they liked

most (and least) about reading on mobile devices. Of the 231 subjects (from the larger pool of 296) who responded to the open- ended questions (most of whom were students), 10% indicated that what they liked least related to cognitive focus, critical thinking, or retention. For example, one woman wrote, "[It's] harder to focus on a computer screen"; another female explained, "With my iPad, I can get distracted very easily by my ability to switch back and forth between the internet and the reading." A man wrote that "it is hard to remember where u read things"; and another male maintained that when using an iPhone "I . . . am rushed and multitasking (reading, moving about, interpreting my surroundings), so I don't think I'm retaining content/narrative from my reading as well as when I'm better situated." With one exception, no one indicated a cognitive advantage to reading on-screen.
EMOTION, AESTHETICS, AND PHYSICALITY

tal platforms (particularly computers, iPod Touches, and mobile phones) but judged it easier to concentrate when reading on platforms that lacked Internet connectivity (hard copy, e-readers of the time the study was conducted). Like subjects in the irst group, many voiced preference for the physical aspects of books. his research captures only some of the issues afecting today's readers. However, by combining indings from the two studies with other discussions of reading, we can begin to identify factors that may be shaping a deinition of what it means to read in the digital age. Factors Contributing to Redefining Reading
COGNITIVE AND PEDAGOGICAL ISSUES DERIVING FROM READING ON-SCREEN

his is the domain in which we would anticipate inding digital technology afecting what we mean by reading. Issues include
· Loss of concentration due to distraction (especially by other functions available through digital devices). he exception here may be e-readers that do not have general Internet connection (Jacobs, Pleasures 81, 82). · Exchanging linear reading for searching or skimming. In the memorable words of Joe O'Shea, a newly selected Rhodes scholar, "I don't read books per se. I go to Google and I can absorb relevant information quickly. Some of this comes from books. But sitting down and going through a book from cover to cover doesn't make sense. It's not a good use of my time as I can get all the information I need faster through the web" (qtd. in Jacobs, Pleasures 72). he "Find" function in online reading has created a new culture of what elsewhere I have called "snippet literacy" (Always On 204­06). · Shrinking expectations about reasonable text length. he proliferation of short textual formats (instant messages, text messages, Twitter, mobile apps for news outlets, and even mobile-phone novels [Goodyear]) correlates with perceptions that we lack the leisure time for longer reading (Griswold,

Another 10% of the open-ended responses regarding what subjects liked least about reading on-screen related to emotional or aesthetic issues or to the physicality of books. One man wrote, "You feel disconnected from the work, and they do not smell of rich leather binding"; another cited "lack of tangibility"; and a female said, "I just like the feel of books." Similarly, the female respondent quoted in this essay's epigraph complained that a mobile reading device is "not a book" and that since it's plugged into the Internet, "you can't concentrate." The Future of Reading Our two studies of user perspectives regarding reading platforms present a nuanced portrait. he irst study revealed that while many students are not keeping their books (or doing much annotating), most nonetheless prefer reading in hard copy and perceive such reading to have cognitive advantages over reading on-screen. In the second study, students reported doing substantial reading on digi-

McDonnell, and Wright) and with university faculty members' growing tendency to assign short online readings (chapters, articles) in lieu of entire books. · Assumption that reading should include instant access to other resources. Platforms with Internet access enable users, in the act of reading, to draw relevant information from other sources. As a subject in the second study reported, what she liked most about reading on a mobile device was being able to "toggle between my book and my foreign language dictionaries easily."
LOSING THE PHYSICALITY OF THE BOOK

A second--and less anticipated--impact of digital technology on what it means to read involves the physicality of the printed book. Readers expressed a variety of concerns leading us to infer that physicality has been part of their notion of reading:
· Emotions and aesthetics. Subjects in the second study complained that with digital media "[y]ou lose the sense of being inside the book when you read anything but a hard copy." hey also spoke of the tactile and olfactory relationship they had with books ("I like turning pages. It's satisfying"; "he disadvantage [of a Kindle or iPhone] is that it doesn't have the feel and smell of a book"). · Navigation in a physical book. Several research participants noted enjoying the process of physically navigating in a book. In the second study, one commented that reading on a mobile device was "not as satisfying as getting a chunk of a book done," while another objected that with mobile readers it was not possible to see how far along in the book you were. A third subject mentioned the importance of seeing the book's cover: "[I] don't remember the book title/author as well [with a Kindle] because [I] don't see as oten . . . [the] cover of [the] book." And a fourth missed being able to easily lip back and forth in the text to ind a particular passage.

· Reading by eye and hand. Annotation of digital texts is still fairly cumbersome, though sure to improve over time. Many readers commented that (at least at the time of the studies) only physical books permitted convenient annotation. · he social function of physical books. Printed books (and what we write in them) can serve as the basis for social interaction. Undoubtedly, networked computing has enabled us to easily exchange newspaper articles, Web site URLs, and the like with one another. But, as one subject commented, you can't lend e-books. With digital materials, you also can't share in the reading experience of someone who annotated a text you come upon in a library or used bookstore or to whom you lent a book in which the borrower then wrote. (Samuel Coleridge was notorious--and oten appreciated--for annotating borrowed books.)3 · Physical jog to memory. Browsing the shelves of a physical library (personal or public) can prod one's memory--of books enjoyed in the past, of forgotten titles that now prove relevant. While one can scan titles in an electronic ile, this is a very diferent physical (and perhaps cognitive) experience.

Conclusions The meaning of reading has not remained static. Some changes have involved shits in individual or social practice, such as the transition from reading aloud to reading silently (Saenger, Space) or from reading to others to reading by oneself (Manguel). Other changes relect the emergence of navigational tools, including tables of contents and indexes. Printing encouraged standardization of abbreviations and replacement of hard-to-read cursive hand with more-legible print (both of which made for faster reading), along with the proliferation of page numbers, increasingly used for cross-referencing within a text (Saenger, "Impact"). Other changes in reading relected technological developments unrelated to print. In

the eighteenth century the increased afordability of windows in middle-class residences made reading physically easier (Watt). The growth of railroads in the nineteenth century resulted in long journeys on which reading was a good pastime (Altick). Literacy rates in the West soared in modern times. So, too, did the amount people read. he nineteenthcentury British triple-decker novel epitomized the "long read." However, a chorus of voices is now concluding that long-form reading, slow and careful reading, and even regular opportunities to read for enjoyment are not reasonable expectations for a wide swath of educated people (Griswold, McDonnell, and Wright; Jacobs, "We"; Steiner). Rather, it is more appropriate to think in terms of a "self-perpetuating minority that we shall call the reading class" (Griswold, McDonnell, and Wright 138). Mass education has led many people to read but not necessarily to the cognitively focused, physically grounded reading with which dedicated readers (including many subjects in the studies cited above) tend to identify. Perhaps, as Alan Jacobs argues, we should recognize that "the whole environment of school is simply alien to what longform reading has been for almost all of its history. . . . Education is and should be primarily about intellectual navigation, about . . . skimming well, and reading carefully for information in order to upload content. Slow and patient reading, by contrast, properly belongs to our leisure hours" ("We"). Given the paucity of leisure, we might anticipate that the number of people engaging in "[s]low and patient reading" will be small. In evaluating the impact of digital technologies on what it means to read, we need to be mindful that just as the notion of reading is complex, so are the ways in which we must think about reading platforms. First, we must not mistake nostalgia for substance. While a number of subjects in my studies saw the feel and smell of books as vital to the reading experience, people a century ago may have dis-

played parallel sentiments about their horses and travel. Moreover, some might argue that young adults are not suiciently "digitally native," given their extensive experience with print media, or that the studies did not use random sampling. Second, digital-reading technologies are still new. It took more than a decade for e-readers to penetrate the market, partly because earlier technologies were not user-friendly. Given the rapid appearance of new functionalities on mobile media, it is foolhardy to assume that future digital-reading platforms cannot overcome some of the shortcomings that current readers identiied. hird, each information and communication technology has its own afordances--that is, functions for which it is particularly well suited (Sellen and Harper). Besides praising mobile devices for being lightweight and able to contain dozens of books, our subjects commented on the ease with which they could access materials related to their reading (e.g., dictionaries or Web pages), as well as on the fact that nonnetworked devices such as e-readers of the time facilitated concentrating on just reading. These issues notwithstanding, the fact remains that digital-reading platforms support some functions of reading more than others. Such platforms are useful when one is reading for information and to ill in small gaps of free time. In an earlier cross-cultural study of mobile-phone use, I found university students oten used their phones to kill time ("Attitudes"). With the explosive development of apps on iPhones and iPads, killing time by reading snippets on mobile media has become yet more pervasive. It is less clear that reading on digital platforms is useful in reading for deeper understanding. he odds seem stacked against this function, given diiculties in annotation, a reader's tendency not to reread or remember digital text (compared with hard copy), and the overwhelming likelihood that people reading on digital devices will be multitasking, thereby dividing their attention.

Taken together, all the factors we have been talking about point to a notion of reading that structurally privileges locating information over deciphering and analyzing more- complex text. This structural bent becomes increasingly important in planning educational curricula as the number of online courses (along with online readings) skyrockets and as readers flock to e-books because they are nearly always less expensive than their print counterparts. We must not let pedagogical and economic pressures cause us to lose sight of the question of whether a new notion of reading is emerging, in which deep and sustained reading (for work or pleasure) runs second to information gathering and short-term distraction.
