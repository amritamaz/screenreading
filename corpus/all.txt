Redefining Reading: The Impact of Digital Communication Media
It's not a book. It doesn't have a smell, you don't touch it . . . , you're plugged into the internet, you can't concentrate, it hurts your eyes, and you lose the beauty of the words behind this screen. Life itself is in hard copy. . . . Not this treacherous digitalism which has permeated our lives and our reality. --Respondent to survey comparing on-screen with hard-copy reading

EACH NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY BE JANUS-FACED, POTENTIALLY IMPROVING AND DEGRADING THE HUMAN CONDITION. THE STEAM ENGINE made industrial products cheaper and more diverse but contributed to the exploitation of child labor and proliferation of squalid urban living conditions. he automobile makes transportation more convenient but pollutes and leads to countless highway deaths. Calculators let anyone perform feats of math but have weakened basic arithmetic skills. A related conundrum holds true for technologies of the written word. he printing press helped spread literacy but shook the foundations of the Catholic Church. Word processing enabled the Japanese to generate text without producing each kanji stroke by stroke, but now many Japanese ind themselves forgetting the stroke order. he spelling checkers in word-processing programs monitor typographical errors but dampen motivation to master spelling. Information and communication technologies have generated new platforms on which to read. he list includes desktop and laptop computers, e-readers (such as the Kindle and Nook), tablet computers (e.g., the iPad), and handheld devices (e.g., the iPod Touch, mobile phones). But does reading on these devices difer from reading in hard copy? If so, does our growing dependence on reading onscreen contribute to a redeinition of what it means to read? What Does It Mean to Read? Just as text can designate many things (Paradise Lost, a soup can label, a traic sign), so can reading. First, what kind of reading materials do we have in mind?

newspaper articles, novels, and religious works (rather than, e.g., news headlines or tweets). Next, how do we approach text? Do we read linearly (from start to inish), or do we seek out snippets (using a table of contents, an index, or the "Find" function for searching an online text)? Do we skim or engage in "deep" reading (Wolf and Barzillai)? Do we read quickly or slowly? Answers to these questions are oten shaped by the character of the text. Is the material familiar or new to the reader? How complex are the words, the syntax, and the concepts? Functionality is also a consideration in deining reading (reading for information, for conceptual understanding, for enjoyment, or to kill time), as is the physical medium (a scroll, a paperback, an iPhone). Reading is, of course, just half of literacy. he other half is writing. Historically, ability to read has not always implied ability to write--or vice versa (Baron, Alphabet 81­82). However, in modern times, when we speak of people being literate, we generally mean readers who possess at least some writing skills. hese skills may be used not only in producing original text but also in annotating what others have written or in copying out passages of existing texts. Writing has commonly accompanied the act of reading. Reader markings appear in all sorts of texts (Caxton Club; Jackson), from marginalia in the Gutenberg Bible to underlining in a literature professor's well-worn copy of a Jane Austen novel. Written accompaniment to this act of reading can ill various roles. he simplest is to make parts of a text prominent (by underlining, highlighting, or adding asterisks, lines, or squiggles). More-reflective responses are notes written in the margins or in an external location--a notebook or a computer file. For many contemporary readers, textual annotation remains integral to reading. User Perspectives on Reading A burgeoning literature is considering how using the Internet may be afecting cognitive

activity (e.g., Carr; Cull; Greenield; Small and Vorgan). he work draws evidence from a variety of sources, including neurological imaging and objective performance on cognitive tasks. Some studies directly address reading on-screen. Jakob Nielsen has reported that "people rarely read Web pages word by word." Investigators at University College London, examining how users interact with online research sites, concluded that "users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of `reading' are emerging as users `power browse' horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense" (Information Behaviour 10). While the graduate students studied by Ziming Liu turned irst to a library's onlineinformation resources or the Web for help in completing assignments, 80% of them "always" or "frequently" printed out electronic documents (586, 587). Professional writers such as Nicholson Baker, Alan Jacobs, and David Ulin have weighed in on how reading on digital media compares with reading in hard copy (the general consensus being that e-readers are somewhat clunky but may provide a platform for uninterrupted reading of longer texts). However, it is also important to hear the voices of ordinary readers, especially those of university students--the irst generation of "digital natives." herefore, in fall 2010 and fall 2011, I investigated users' perspectives on the difference between reading in hard copy and reading on digital platforms. Study 1 he initial study involved 82 undergraduates (aged eighteen to twenty-four) at a midsize private university in the United States. Using a questionnaire mounted on SurveyMonkey (a commercial online survey instrument), participants were asked such questions as

how oten ("most of the time," "sometimes," "occasionally," "never") they annotated their textbooks by highlighting or underlining words or making notes in the books. In addition, open- ended questions probed what students liked most (and least) about reading on-screen and in hard copy. Finally, subjects were invited to ofer further comments. We look here at the results most relevant to the present discussion.1
OWNERSHIP AND ANNOTATION OF TEXTBOOKS

then printed it out. When asked whether they were more likely to read an assigned article if it was available online or if they were handed a copy, 6% said "available online," while 56% chose "handed a copy." (The other 38% declared it made no diference.)
COGNITIVE AND USABILITY ISSUES

Several questions addressed students' relationships with their textbooks. We found that 61% of the students sold their textbooks at the end of the semester "most of the time," 51% were renting hard copies of some of their textbooks, and 48% indicated that they annotated their textbooks only "occasionally" or "never." Given that more than half the students were disposing of their books at the end of the semester, there is a certain logic to not annotating them.
PREFERRED MODE FOR READING

Another series of questions examined students' preferred platforms for reading diferent genres (such as serious noniction, light iction, newspapers), either for academic purposes or for pleasure. Except for academic journals and newspapers, students overwhelmingly preferred to read texts in hard copy rather than online. (Of relevance is that the university had recently moved its boundjournal collection of-site, necessitating reliance on electronic journals.)
DOING ASSIGNED READING

Two questions probed how students approached reading assignments. When asked which platform they preferred if academic reading materials were available online, 55% favored reading the assignment online. However, 39% indicated they usually printed out the material and then read it, while another 6% noted they read the material online and

he survey explored students' level of engagement with reading materials, along with cognitive outcomes. When asked whether they reread academic materials, 49% said "occasionally" and 10% said "never." These selfreports are consistent with the earlier inding that 48% only "occasionally" or "never" wrote in their textbooks, since annotations typically facilitate reviewing a text that has already been read. However, when asked if they were more likely to reread academic materials available in hard copy or on-screen, 66% selected hard copy, compared with only 24% who chose on-screen. (The other 10% indicated they didn't reread.) When students were asked how their memory of what they read on-screen compared with their memory of what they read in hard copy, 46% indicated the medium didn't matter, 51% reported they had better memory for material read in hard copy, and only 2% said they retained more of what they read on-screen. Even more telling were subjects' responses regarding multitasking: 90% replied they were likely to multitask when reading on-screen, compared with only 1% when reading in hard copy. (he other 9% said they were equally likely to multitask when reading in either mode.) Cognitive and pedagogical issues also surfaced in the open-ended questions about what subjects liked most (and least) about reading in each medium. When asked what they liked least about reading on-screen, 91% complained about something cognitive ("I get distracted," "I don't absorb as much"). Similarly, when asked what they liked most about reading in hard copy, 78% of the responses

196

PM L A

involved cognition or usability (it is "necessary for focus," "I can write in it").
RESOURCE ISSUES

In their "like most"/"like least" responses, some students volunteered sentiments relating either to ecological resources (what they liked least about reading in hard copy was that it "kills trees") or to money (by reading on-screen, you "don't have to pay to print stuf out"). However, in their comments at the end of the survey, several students acknowledged personal conlicts in choosing between reading platforms ("I prefer hard copies, but think they're bad for the environment," "I know it's a waste of paper, but I really prefer reading a physical book or article to reading it online").
PHYSICALITY OF THE BOOK

While many survey questions explored the physical venues in which respondents read on diferent platforms (standing at a bus stop, sitting in a cofee shop), I focus here on responses relating to cognition and to emotion, aesthetics, and physicality.
COGNITION

Subjects were asked which platform in the following pairs made it easier to concentrate on reading. he responses of the 203 students show clear trends, although only 26 students, or 13%, owned tablets, and 43 students, or 22%, owned e-readers: Hard copy Tablet computer Hard copy E-reader Tablet computer Desktop or laptop computer E-reader Desktop or laptop computer E-reader Tablet computer 90% 10% 67% 33% 68% 32% 78% 22% 64% 36%

Finally, 10% of the subjects indicated that what they liked most about reading in hard copy involved the physicality of books. Among their responses were "having a tangible copy of the text" and "tactile interaction with reading material." he desire for a tangible, tactile relationship with reading material is relected in the fact that many subjects printed out online materials, before or ater reading them. Study 2 The second study compared reading on a variety of digital devices, but it also asked about reading in hard copy by way of comparison. he study was intended to survey a broad spectrum of users (college age and up, from a variety of occupations), though most responses (203 of 296) were from eighteento-twenty-four-year-olds, 192 of whom were students. Ten other students were between twenty-five and thirty-five and 1 between thirty-six and fifty, making a total student population of 203. Using e-mail and Facebook, we recruited subjects to complete a SurveyMonkey questionnaire.2

The perceived advantage of hard copy (over tablet or e-reader) for concentration is not surprising, given results from the irst study indicating preference for reading in hard copy. he students' perceptions that they concentrate better when they read on a tablet than when they read on a desktop or laptop computer likely relect their risk of succumbing to easily accessible online temptations when they use traditional networked computers. (Two-thirds of the student tablet owners indicated they purchased the device primarily for reading.) E-readers, which at the time typically lacked general-purpose Internet connectivity, were seen as posing fewer challenges to concentration than traditional computers or tablets. Cognitive issues were also on the minds of subjects in the second study as they responded to the open-ended questions: what they liked

most (and least) about reading on mobile devices. Of the 231 subjects (from the larger pool of 296) who responded to the open- ended questions (most of whom were students), 10% indicated that what they liked least related to cognitive focus, critical thinking, or retention. For example, one woman wrote, "[It's] harder to focus on a computer screen"; another female explained, "With my iPad, I can get distracted very easily by my ability to switch back and forth between the internet and the reading." A man wrote that "it is hard to remember where u read things"; and another male maintained that when using an iPhone "I . . . am rushed and multitasking (reading, moving about, interpreting my surroundings), so I don't think I'm retaining content/narrative from my reading as well as when I'm better situated." With one exception, no one indicated a cognitive advantage to reading on-screen.
EMOTION, AESTHETICS, AND PHYSICALITY

tal platforms (particularly computers, iPod Touches, and mobile phones) but judged it easier to concentrate when reading on platforms that lacked Internet connectivity (hard copy, e-readers of the time the study was conducted). Like subjects in the irst group, many voiced preference for the physical aspects of books. his research captures only some of the issues afecting today's readers. However, by combining indings from the two studies with other discussions of reading, we can begin to identify factors that may be shaping a deinition of what it means to read in the digital age. Factors Contributing to Redefining Reading
COGNITIVE AND PEDAGOGICAL ISSUES DERIVING FROM READING ON-SCREEN

his is the domain in which we would anticipate inding digital technology afecting what we mean by reading. Issues include
· Loss of concentration due to distraction (especially by other functions available through digital devices). he exception here may be e-readers that do not have general Internet connection (Jacobs, Pleasures 81, 82). · Exchanging linear reading for searching or skimming. In the memorable words of Joe O'Shea, a newly selected Rhodes scholar, "I don't read books per se. I go to Google and I can absorb relevant information quickly. Some of this comes from books. But sitting down and going through a book from cover to cover doesn't make sense. It's not a good use of my time as I can get all the information I need faster through the web" (qtd. in Jacobs, Pleasures 72). he "Find" function in online reading has created a new culture of what elsewhere I have called "snippet literacy" (Always On 204­06). · Shrinking expectations about reasonable text length. he proliferation of short textual formats (instant messages, text messages, Twitter, mobile apps for news outlets, and even mobile-phone novels [Goodyear]) correlates with perceptions that we lack the leisure time for longer reading (Griswold,

Another 10% of the open-ended responses regarding what subjects liked least about reading on-screen related to emotional or aesthetic issues or to the physicality of books. One man wrote, "You feel disconnected from the work, and they do not smell of rich leather binding"; another cited "lack of tangibility"; and a female said, "I just like the feel of books." Similarly, the female respondent quoted in this essay's epigraph complained that a mobile reading device is "not a book" and that since it's plugged into the Internet, "you can't concentrate." The Future of Reading Our two studies of user perspectives regarding reading platforms present a nuanced portrait. he irst study revealed that while many students are not keeping their books (or doing much annotating), most nonetheless prefer reading in hard copy and perceive such reading to have cognitive advantages over reading on-screen. In the second study, students reported doing substantial reading on digi-

McDonnell, and Wright) and with university faculty members' growing tendency to assign short online readings (chapters, articles) in lieu of entire books. · Assumption that reading should include instant access to other resources. Platforms with Internet access enable users, in the act of reading, to draw relevant information from other sources. As a subject in the second study reported, what she liked most about reading on a mobile device was being able to "toggle between my book and my foreign language dictionaries easily."
LOSING THE PHYSICALITY OF THE BOOK

A second--and less anticipated--impact of digital technology on what it means to read involves the physicality of the printed book. Readers expressed a variety of concerns leading us to infer that physicality has been part of their notion of reading:
· Emotions and aesthetics. Subjects in the second study complained that with digital media "[y]ou lose the sense of being inside the book when you read anything but a hard copy." hey also spoke of the tactile and olfactory relationship they had with books ("I like turning pages. It's satisfying"; "he disadvantage [of a Kindle or iPhone] is that it doesn't have the feel and smell of a book"). · Navigation in a physical book. Several research participants noted enjoying the process of physically navigating in a book. In the second study, one commented that reading on a mobile device was "not as satisfying as getting a chunk of a book done," while another objected that with mobile readers it was not possible to see how far along in the book you were. A third subject mentioned the importance of seeing the book's cover: "[I] don't remember the book title/author as well [with a Kindle] because [I] don't see as oten . . . [the] cover of [the] book." And a fourth missed being able to easily lip back and forth in the text to ind a particular passage.

· Reading by eye and hand. Annotation of digital texts is still fairly cumbersome, though sure to improve over time. Many readers commented that (at least at the time of the studies) only physical books permitted convenient annotation. · he social function of physical books. Printed books (and what we write in them) can serve as the basis for social interaction. Undoubtedly, networked computing has enabled us to easily exchange newspaper articles, Web site URLs, and the like with one another. But, as one subject commented, you can't lend e-books. With digital materials, you also can't share in the reading experience of someone who annotated a text you come upon in a library or used bookstore or to whom you lent a book in which the borrower then wrote. (Samuel Coleridge was notorious--and oten appreciated--for annotating borrowed books.)3 · Physical jog to memory. Browsing the shelves of a physical library (personal or public) can prod one's memory--of books enjoyed in the past, of forgotten titles that now prove relevant. While one can scan titles in an electronic ile, this is a very diferent physical (and perhaps cognitive) experience.

Conclusions The meaning of reading has not remained static. Some changes have involved shits in individual or social practice, such as the transition from reading aloud to reading silently (Saenger, Space) or from reading to others to reading by oneself (Manguel). Other changes relect the emergence of navigational tools, including tables of contents and indexes. Printing encouraged standardization of abbreviations and replacement of hard-to-read cursive hand with more-legible print (both of which made for faster reading), along with the proliferation of page numbers, increasingly used for cross-referencing within a text (Saenger, "Impact"). Other changes in reading relected technological developments unrelated to print. In

the eighteenth century the increased afordability of windows in middle-class residences made reading physically easier (Watt). The growth of railroads in the nineteenth century resulted in long journeys on which reading was a good pastime (Altick). Literacy rates in the West soared in modern times. So, too, did the amount people read. he nineteenthcentury British triple-decker novel epitomized the "long read." However, a chorus of voices is now concluding that long-form reading, slow and careful reading, and even regular opportunities to read for enjoyment are not reasonable expectations for a wide swath of educated people (Griswold, McDonnell, and Wright; Jacobs, "We"; Steiner). Rather, it is more appropriate to think in terms of a "self-perpetuating minority that we shall call the reading class" (Griswold, McDonnell, and Wright 138). Mass education has led many people to read but not necessarily to the cognitively focused, physically grounded reading with which dedicated readers (including many subjects in the studies cited above) tend to identify. Perhaps, as Alan Jacobs argues, we should recognize that "the whole environment of school is simply alien to what longform reading has been for almost all of its history. . . . Education is and should be primarily about intellectual navigation, about . . . skimming well, and reading carefully for information in order to upload content. Slow and patient reading, by contrast, properly belongs to our leisure hours" ("We"). Given the paucity of leisure, we might anticipate that the number of people engaging in "[s]low and patient reading" will be small. In evaluating the impact of digital technologies on what it means to read, we need to be mindful that just as the notion of reading is complex, so are the ways in which we must think about reading platforms. First, we must not mistake nostalgia for substance. While a number of subjects in my studies saw the feel and smell of books as vital to the reading experience, people a century ago may have dis-

played parallel sentiments about their horses and travel. Moreover, some might argue that young adults are not suiciently "digitally native," given their extensive experience with print media, or that the studies did not use random sampling. Second, digital-reading technologies are still new. It took more than a decade for e-readers to penetrate the market, partly because earlier technologies were not user-friendly. Given the rapid appearance of new functionalities on mobile media, it is foolhardy to assume that future digital-reading platforms cannot overcome some of the shortcomings that current readers identiied. hird, each information and communication technology has its own afordances--that is, functions for which it is particularly well suited (Sellen and Harper). Besides praising mobile devices for being lightweight and able to contain dozens of books, our subjects commented on the ease with which they could access materials related to their reading (e.g., dictionaries or Web pages), as well as on the fact that nonnetworked devices such as e-readers of the time facilitated concentrating on just reading. These issues notwithstanding, the fact remains that digital-reading platforms support some functions of reading more than others. Such platforms are useful when one is reading for information and to ill in small gaps of free time. In an earlier cross-cultural study of mobile-phone use, I found university students oten used their phones to kill time ("Attitudes"). With the explosive development of apps on iPhones and iPads, killing time by reading snippets on mobile media has become yet more pervasive. It is less clear that reading on digital platforms is useful in reading for deeper understanding. he odds seem stacked against this function, given diiculties in annotation, a reader's tendency not to reread or remember digital text (compared with hard copy), and the overwhelming likelihood that people reading on digital devices will be multitasking, thereby dividing their attention.

Taken together, all the factors we have been talking about point to a notion of reading that structurally privileges locating information over deciphering and analyzing more- complex text. This structural bent becomes increasingly important in planning educational curricula as the number of online courses (along with online readings) skyrockets and as readers flock to e-books because they are nearly always less expensive than their print counterparts. We must not let pedagogical and economic pressures cause us to lose sight of the question of whether a new notion of reading is emerging, in which deep and sustained reading (for work or pleasure) runs second to information gathering and short-term distraction.

¤ Reading online is, we know, a keyword-driven process, and the reader (this reader) has to exert near-constant mental counter-pressure -- drive with his foot on the brakes, as it were -- if he is to read words on screen in the way that he once, when younger and more assiduous, read words in books. The editors of Bustillos' article clearly understood this, and so, instead of engineering anything that would work as a speed-bump, they laid the piece out for us fast-lane drivers, with short paragraphs and a way of linkhighlighting whatever sense-nuggets appeared, so that one could either click and delve, or hasten forward. For instance, a reference to the journal Naturedid not merely underline that one word, but also the phrase beside it -- Nature stood by its methods and results -- so that the eye almost irresistibly vaulted to the next nearby link, giving, at least in the opening pages, a choppy précis of what the writer was saying. Gist: Wikipedia is the one-stop reference du jour, an excellent tool, well-supervised, accountable, offering three main advantages over the print "ancestors," these being --

and on she went at bullet speed. After this, however, there comes an easing of the incessant hyperlinking and a sense that the main discussion is being engaged, which is good for Bustillos, as my lateral propulsion had me all but lifting off the page. The Wikipedia pitch was obvious enough, but now it appears that more than the efficacy of Wikipedia is at issue. With minimal transition, Bustillos introduces cyber-theorist Bob Stein, identified as the founder and codirector of the Institute for the Future of the Book (http://www.futureofthebook.org/), who then serves a kind of emcee function, invoking Marshall McLuhan as the thinker to reckon with on the question of digital collaboration. All sorts of potential links have been left unhighlighted, and I find myself decelerating, getting more engaged. Marshall McLuhan. Here is the old master, the original media pundit, whose name I can never encounter without flashing back fifty years to dinner parties my parents hosted. I would eavesdrop: all this talk about the "global village" and "the medium is the message." I remember the vibration in the air -- this was something new, this had people going. Now Bustillos has Stein recalling McLuhan, adapting him to his particular purpose -- or is it Bustillos adapting Stein? -- working the article to build toward his dramatic assertion, which I will get to, which I want to put across as the culmination it was, it being the sentence that lanced through my screen and got me so agitated. But there is something like a world-view that needs to be set out first. Once McLuhan has been introduced, Bustillos enlarges the field of action, quoting the man from his 1969 Playboy interview:

(/essay/the-death-ofthe-book) (/essay/lifein-storageofcapitalismand-aesstorage-wars)

The computer [thus] holds out the promise of a technologically engendered state of universal understanding and unity, a state of absorption in the Logos that could knit mankind into one family and create a perpetuity of harmony and peace.

I can't but feel some dissonance here. How not? I'm reading these words in May of 2011, when it takes the fingers of both hands to count up the world's conflicts and hot spots of dissent, sites where "understanding and unity" have completely collapsed. But this is not the real point. And because the topic is, nominally, Wikipedia, and because Bob Stein has been brought in to raise the stakes, and because there is a technological vision being put forward that can no longer be discounted, I read. I can ignore the harmony and peace part of the formulation, but the other, the idea that we are being almost irresistibly gathered into a "technologically engendered state,"that has a renewed heat. This "state," for me, is the issue, the situation, and the crisis, and something about this casually strung-together article -- its references, assumptions and attitudes -- incites me in ways that other, possibly more reasoned and articulate presentations have not done. Having claimed McLuhan for her side (the sides originally set up as Wikipedia versus Brittanica), Bustillos moves to take on the idea of the expert, and, implicitly, authority itself. She starts by referencing McLuhan's years at Cambridge, when he was studying to be a literary critic (!), how he fell under the influence of the New Critics. "Before these rationalists came on the scene," she writes, "literary criticism had a mystical character rooted in the Romantic ideas of guys like Walter Pater..." That "guys" says a great deal about the status of that cultural legacy for Bustillos (or else about me and my sensitivity to insult). But this is not her point. Her point is that McLuhan, through his exposure to the "English Department renegade" F. R. Leavis, "developed the beginnings of the life-long distaste for 'expertise' and 'authority' that would come to characterize his work." Keeping in mind that this is an article promoting Wikipedia not only as the new authority-less authoritative reference source, but as the paradigm of the rapidly changing way of things, the McLuhan invocation makes more

sense. After sketching in McLuhan's early development as a media theorist, his recognition about how technologies alter the structure of our thinking, and the powerful influence on his thought of Canadian thinker Harold Innis, who was known less for his reasoned argumentation than for offering his reader a kind of mosaic of facts, perspectives and surmises, Bustillos proposes that the various elements of McLuhan's approach,

the abandonment of "point of view," the willingness to consider the present with the same urgency as the past, the borrowing "of wit and wisdom from any man who is capable of lending us either," the desire to understand the mechanisms by which we are made to understand -- are also cornerstones of intellectual innovation in the Internet age.

She then asks and simultaneously asserts "How neatly does this dovetail into a subtle and surprising new appreciation of the communal knowledgemaking at Wikipedia?!" McLuhan, so long mothballed as a Founding Father, has been re-purposed as the patron saint of this anti-expert "communal knowledge-making."

¤ At this point Bustillos makes an abrupt shift of focus. She brings her lens to rest on a contemporary media thinker, Jaron Lanier, and his recent critique of what he calls "the hive mind," which is in essence the collective process she has been celebrating. Lanier, in his important 2006 article "Digital Maoism," and much more recently in his book-length manifestoYou Are Not a Gadget, has stood up for both individuality and authorship. I had not, until recently, been aware that these were demon-concepts. But in some quarters they clearly are. Of his position, Bustillos quips: "...reading his stuff is like watching a guy lose his shirt at the roulette wheel and still he keeps putting everything on the same number." Here I am far less interested in Bustillos' reasoning, which is mainly that of the leap-frogging enthusiast, than I am in the assumptive tone, the manner, the confidence. It is a tone we often hear in the voices of those who believe their historical moment has come. It dares a mocking intonation, a casual dismissiveness: Pater is a "guy" and Lanier, standing up for individuality and authorship, well, he too is a "guy." I would not fasten so readily on Bustillos' breezily casual mode if it did not seem to be, beyond a baiting tactic, a harbinger of new attitudes. How better to get after any stance or idea than by first de-dignifying its proponents? Tolstoy -- who cyber-agitator Clay Shirkey dismissed as unreadable two years ago -- becomes the guy who wrote all those long battle scenes, Michelangelo the guy who painted all those great abs on people... But here the man under attack is one who has ventured to question the ultimate value of Internet group-think, and who has the temerity to speak for the importance of the individual subject. Why does she choose Lanier? Because he has for years been a Silicon Valley insider, one of its central thinkers, and heretical assertions like his -- from within the fold -- cannot be countenanced. The speed with which various bedrock human assumptions -- the value of the individual self, e.g. -- are lapel-flicked away I find breathtaking. Bustillos finds it "difficult to see how Lanier ... will be able to keep this sort of thing up for much longer. Michael Agger took Lanier's book to ribbons in Slate: '[Lanier's] critique is ultimately just a particular brand of snobbery. [He] is a Romantic snob. He believes in individual genius and creativity...'" Again, we need to note which terms are being tagged derisively. Bustillos is not done. She now again quotes Bob Stein, this time his review of Lanier's "Digital Maoism" article:

At its core, Jaron's piece defends the traditional role of the individual author, particularly the hierarchy that renders readers as passive recipients of an author's wisdom. Jaron is fundamentally resistant to the new emerging sense of the author as moderator -- someone able to marshal "the wisdom of the network."

The author rushes in behind Stein: "Events have long ago overtaken the small matter of 'the independent author,'" she writes. "The question that counts now is: the line between author and reader is blurring, whether we like it or not." I can't quite parse out the question there, but I see that Bustillos believes that the traditional place of the author is being superseded. In the world according to 2.0, these are deemed to be some of the big changes of our moment. Expertise, authorship, individual creativity: out. Team collaborations, Wikipedia: in. Inevitably: "Knowledge is growing more broadly and immediately participatory and collaborative by the moment." And now I come to it, without as much of a drum roll as I'd hoped, the last word, the formulation that penetrated my stimulus screen. Bob Stein gets the last important words, but what an epigram they make. Simply: "The sadness of our age is characterized by the shackles of individualism." I leave a space here -- a moment in which to re-read and ponder those words.

¤ It may seem odd that I've spent so much time summarizing and quoting from a web-posted pro-Wikipedia polemic, but this piece struck me, got down under my skin more irritatingly than most, and I needed to understand why. I think I do now. Here, in one place, I find not only a number of the issues I have been worrying for some time, but also, as I've suggested, some of the attitudes and assumptions that inform the situation, compose the climate in which the transformations are taking place. This "climate" has been the hardest thing to isolate for reflection, for it is a totality, an environment, a cultural Zeitgeist. I have tagged it for myself with a re-phrasing of the outworn idiom. "What if the elephant in the room," I ask, "is the room itself?" Reading Bustillos' article was the closest I've come to identifying that vast intangible for myself. It was there, as much in her definitional jockeying, her style of differentiating between worldviews, as in the thematic implication of the ideas themselves. Reading it, I thought: here are the pieces I need. "Wikipedia and the Death of the Expert." The title is as good a place to begin as any other. I note the immediate polarization of concepts -- Wikipedia and expert -- and the arresting announcement of the death of the latter. And though Bustillos does not establish causality -- she has not called it "How Wikipedia killed the expert" -- some of that implication inevitably attaches. "The king died and then the queen died is a story," wrote E.M. Forster in his well-known distinction between a story and a plot. "The king died, and then the queen died of grief is a plot." What Bustillos' title offers as a story, is, for me, a plot. A causal narrative. Whatever term we decide on, it is a serious matter, one that fills me with some of the queen's grief. Let me address the main business straight on. Big as the Wikipedia question is -- the question of the collaborative production of information -- there are deeper issues still, issues for which Wikipedia versus Britannica, Bustillos's comparative point of departure, is only the outer sign. And indeed, Wikipedia versus Britannica is not really even a viable polarization. After all, both are, though in clearly differing ways, collectivized enterprises looking to deliver accessible expertise to users. Bustillos's real agenda, which she gets at by way of issues of said expertise and of collaboration, is to lay out two diametrically opposed conceptions of the human and then, in

effect, to cast her vote. Here we have the split, the road-fork issuing in two paths that would with every step take the pilgrim on one further from his counterpart on the other. There is no eventual convergence. The one is the path -- the ideal -- of the individualized self, the other is the path of the socially and neurally collectivized self, along which, at some undetermined point, the idea of "self" itself must blur away, become a term no longer applicable. There have been various iterations of this latter idea, starting perhaps with theologian Teilhard de Chardin's spiritualized imagining that there will one day exist what he called a noosphere, a kind of rapture belt of merged human identity girdling the planet. Then there was Forster's prescient depiction, in his story "The Machine Stops," of a world of beings living in isolated cells, interconnected by a communications network that is uncannily like the Internet. And, much more recently, we have media theorist Kevin Kelly's variously expressed ideas about the "hive," a world in which the electronic connections between people have fused to become a quasi-nervous system, bringing about a kind of cognitive collectivism. It was Kelly, too, who has been most vigorous in advancing the idea of the universalized book: all the world's texts and data scanned into one vast keyword-searchable database. Kelly was most certainly the thinker Lanier had in mind when he spoke out against the dangers of the hive mentality. As he put it in "Digital Maoism": "the hive mind is for the most part stupid and boring." And: "The beauty of the Internet is that it connects people. The value is in the other people. If we start to believe that the Internet is itself an entity that has something to say, we're devaluing those people and making ourselves into idiots." Kant this is not, granted, but Bustillos exhibits nothing but sneering contempt for the expression, responding: "I guess if we started to believe that the Internet itself were writing Wikipedia we would be in some trouble, or maybe we would be Rod Serling, I don't know."

¤ Electronic collectivism has very quickly gone from being a sci-fi imagining to being a plausible scenario that more and more people, at least those active in the computer-culture, would endorse for us all. It will be objected that the ambitions of the cyber-sector don't have that much to do with the life of the culture at large. But one could similarly say that the decisions made by a few thousand members of the investment banking community don't affect us either. In fact, there is a connection between the ideas held by that minority and the lives that the rest of us live. The connection is technology, and McLuhan framed it early on:

It is not only our material environment that is transformed by our machinery. We take our technology into the deepest recesses of our souls. Our view of reality, our structures of meaning, our sense of identity -- all are touched and transformed by the technologies which we have allowed to mediate between ourselves and the world. We create machines in our own image and they, in turn, recreate us in theirs.

The sage of Toronto, quoted by Bustillos, encapsulates a great deal here, and it is exactly to the point. The cyber-sector, numerically a minority, could be said in important ways to have a majority voting interest so far as the development, promotion and implementation of technology goes. These are the engineers and marketers behind the enormously influential Itechnologies, all of the daily-more-sophisticated screen devices that have come to seem indispensable to people the world over -- from cell phones to tablets to reading devices of all descriptions. Backed by huge corporate interests, marketed through the global media, these interactive devices (and their consumer images) exert massive collective -- and collectivizing -- effects, and for the very reasons McLuhan hypothesized. We use them in prescribed ways and they determine not just our obvious external reflexes,

our ways of doing business, but they also seep into our deeper selves, what McLuhan quite surprisingly calls our "souls." And in this way, without even officially signing on to hive-oriented behavior and thinking, we begin to manifest it. The point is that these technologies are not used in instrumentally isolated ways. Rather, they create a community of users and a complexly selfreinforcing culture of expectations. This culture, this environment -- how well we know it -- becomes ever more difficult to step away from; and it has various socially coercive implications. Consider the obvious case in point: the cell phone in its current incarnation. What was at point of origin a distinct-use, one-to-one voice-transmitting device has become a mindboggling locus of seemingly indispensable functions, allowing multiple lines of connection between users, giving access to the great data-stream of the Internet, and subtly and not-so-subtly creating new expectations, like that of reachability, of locatability. To own a cell phone is to register yourself in the family of all users; it is to take your place in a network of indeterminate complexity, announcing, in effect, that you are in technological "range" 24/7. Hardly 1984, I agree. But it's worth considering the ways in which we are conditioned by our systems interactions. The cell phone is only one such system, the Internet is another, and the economy, as we enter it through our credit-cards and ATM transactions, is a third. These are just salient instances. Each of these systems, though we rarely think of it this way, yields itself to us by way of numbers and codes; and each by way of other codes dictates the sequence of our actions, the levels of access we are allowed, and whether or not it will function for us, or not. Letters, numbers, codes -- the new coins of the realm. Of course there are effects and consequences. Engaging these systems, we learn right away that the codes and numbers -- our identity proxies -- facilitate our movement through the electronic slipstream. We don't really believe that we become some string of digits or password; we accept this as part of how the system works, just as we accepted long ago our personal all-purpose social security number. Possibly, though, we have noticed that the more we transact our activities via Internet circuits, the less we ever interact with a person, even electronically. Almost all "situations," be they purchases, reservations, account inquiries, trouble-shooting needs, or whatever, are dealt with by our filling in mandatory fields, delivering data and, again, codes. And, of course, every such delivery of data further adumbrates one's virtual profile -- describes more precisely one's preferences, habits, and ailments, so that, as users of the Internet (and this is old news) we are addressed ever more often, and with more honed-in specificity, by way of this pseudopersonhood. How many times daily am I now addressed as "Dear Sven" by software programs behind which, I am certain, no intending individual lurks? This is all such a familiar scenario, much of it long ago imagined for us -- and thereby, curiously, not intensified but defanged -- by various anxious dystopian intellects. So that instead of worrying, "Oh dear, we were warned of a Brave New World by Aldous Huxley," we will tune into more or less the same scenario served up as spoof on a cable channel, and say, "Well, if television thinks this is a laugh ..." Never mind that television thinks almost everything is a laugh and in the space of a 24-hour news cycle can turn most any crisis or catastrophe into skit material or, in the adjacent gaming world, into a first-person shooter program. How do we cope with this growing alienation, this intensifying dissociation from what was formerly the human sphere? Human nature, like Nature itself, abhors a vacuum -- so quite understandably we respond by reaching more avidly toward the people we know, or at least have some proxy contact with, and -- here's the rub -- we often do so by way of the screen. Thus we deepen and extend the circuits.

¤ Obviously I'm speaking in vastly generalized hypothetical terms, trying to get a bead on what I am calling "the room that is itself the elephant in the room." Maybe I should say a bit more about that little koan-like formulation. What I am getting at is my sense that the biggest

transformation that has befallen us -- that we have ourselves helped bring about -- is so total in its nature, and so driven by unseen elements (circuits and signals), that we have no point of purchase for talking about it, and therefore don't; or else, no less distressingly, we imagine that because we cannot see it, cannot put a finger directly on it, nothing much has changed, and that we are still moving about in the status quo ante. (Or status quo elephante.) An elephant should be identifiable, even if it is by way of its various isolated attributes, as happens in the famous cartoon with the group of blindfolded men. One of these is the change in the status of the "expert." Bustillos argues that knowledge, and the presentation of knowledge -- its argumentation -- is shifting away from the hierarchical and analytic mode, and becoming more and more an open field of discrete elements, which can be searched and assembled according to need and use. She harkens to the modernists, to McLuhan and his mentor Harold Innis, and ends up espousing the Wikipedia model, a group-generated assemblage that can be updated and modified at any time. From the vantage of the Wikipedia project, the idea of the lone individual -- thinker, scholar -- is quixotic at best, readily mocked as a hubristic hold-over from a bygone era, as "old school." There's no question that the world is much changed. If the exceptional scholar could once hold great quantities of the world's information comprehensively in mind, she does so with less and less ease and confidence today. The computer, meanwhile, has enabled new levels of interactive collaboration, and Wikipedia is one calling card. But to suggest from that instance that the era of individual initiative in all fields has passed, that the notion of expertise has become laughable -- well, this is another of those intellectual climate-transformations, those Zeitgeist effects, that I'm talking about here. Bustillos seems to be not so much advancing her own argument here as giving voice to assumptions now abroad in the land, at least certain zip code areas of it. Her assertion is tinted with, if not yet saturated by, the collectivist premise by which the private self is an outmoded concept, perhaps elitist, threateningly counter-collective. In this vision, to quote Bob Stein again, "the sadness of our age is characterized by the shackles of individualism." What has happened? Let's not forget that we were all very recently immersed in the opposite, in the culture of self-actualization. The period leading up to the millennium was, among other things, the Therapeutic Age, millions of us bent on finding and empowering the sovereign "I." It can't be that in a few short years we flipped from heads to tails. One could make the argument that even as actualization fever carried the day, the cyber-grid was being assembled, its new procedures gaining ground, and that the implications, though latent, were registered. One could even argue, granting that that latency was broadly intuited, that the great push toward "self' was to some degree exacerbated by the specter of mass existence, and represented a preemptive surge. Possibly it was not preemptive enough. About forces and effects so widespread and inchoate we can only speculate.

¤ Though there are any number of shifts and transformations to be reckoned, all having to do with why the room feels so very different, I will have to let the some stand for the many. But one more element, no less significant, needs to be discussed. It was not a part of Bustillos' broad strokes picture, but I will make it part of mine. I mean the arrival of the "cloud," that epic new development in computing. We hear about cloud computing everywhere these days. It represents the next great leap forward. Premised on a dispersed systems network, cloud computing liberates digital material from hard-drive transmission and creates a free-floating collectively-accessible data saturation. Among other things, this digital saturation hastens the across-the-board obsolescence of a whole class of physical item. We are all witnessing the sudden dematerialization of our arts and entertainment, their transfer from unique

artifact source to universally on-demand screen availability. Walk down Main Street. The video and DVD emporia are gone -- it happened in a year or two. The bookstores, if not yet folded, are quickly going the way of record stores. More and more people are persuaded to access their culture through screen portals, ordering up what they need for their Kindle, their iPod, their nightly watching pleasures. And the middle men, the algorithmically nimble purveyors of books and music and film, increasingly access them -- us -- identifying what they think we want and laying it on our electronic doorstep. Of course there are advantages to all this. Instant access and narrowcasting to gratify our preferences. But there are enormous losses, too. The main one, front and center, call it another pachyderm, is the public and private disappearance of the physical evidence of our tastes and desires. There will be no records or CDs on the shelves of the future, few if any books. Everything will live in bits, in files -- and how can this not modify the general atmosphere? We are removing the physical markers of culture from our collective midst. For a record store was not just a place to get records, as a bookstore was not only for finding the needed read. These were sites where the love of music and literature announced themselves across a spectrum of tastes. And though they were commercial entities, these emporia also symbolized the presence, the value, of their product to the community. What distresses me about the transfer from thing to cloud -- it was Karl Marx who lamented that "all that's solid melts into air" -- is not just the loss of the object, the fetish, the thing, but also the larger thematic implications. Of course we will never dispense with physicality altogether: even the characters in Forster's extreme parable had bodies that lived in cell-like structures. But the primal materiality that governed the terms of existence is being by degrees, quick degrees, put at a distance. In his book The End of Nature, Bill McKibben argued with some persuasiveness that we have tamed nature and domesticated the idea of it. Nature is now for vacations or high-priced adventurings; or else it is, for the fortunate majority of us, a catastrophe spectacle, something else for the AOL home page slide show: tsunami, tornado, calving iceberg. We might try on the big picture for a moment, imagining the terms of physical existence as they were a hundred years ago for the average person, and comparing these with the present. I won't itemize, though I could. The short version is that the world, its elements, its nouns, has receded, as has its intractability, the defining obstacles of time and space. It's almost as if world and screen were in inverse relation, the former fading as the latter keeps gaining in reach, in definition, in its power to compel our attention. Everything about the "room" has changed, and this fact is what makes it so hard to speak of the room. There is also the vital and vexing question: are collaborative, collectivized ways of living entirely at odds with subjectivized ones? Doesn't it make sense to imagine a world where we use systems and circuits to do what they do best and indulge our clamoring selfhood in our ever-more-abundant spare time? It sounds good: The Jetsons meets Abraham Maslow. But, alas, it also sounds like a version of the old "it's just a tool" argument. Maybe things could work that way if our electronic living were not the saturation that it is fast becoming. But if we grant McLuhan's point, that we "take our technology into the deepest recesses of our souls," and that our "view of reality, our structures of meaning, our sense of identity -- all are touched and transformed ..." then we cannot find easy comfort in the both/and perspective. We need to voice and then address the if. If it is so -- if via its almost irresistible systems and skillfully marketed product ideologies, combined with shrinking available venues for private initiative and a broad-based acceptance of the idea that there is nothing at all unnatural about human beings living in steady self-reinforcing electronic milieus -- if this is what we are steering toward, preening ourselves as we quash dissent with ridicule, taking lightly the human outcomes -- what then?

¤ This is obviously a fear phrasing itself as an unanswerable question. It marks the place I had thought to stop, except that I now feel a nagging sense of incompleteness -- structurally, if not metaphysically. I did, after all, introduce the image of the diverging paths, one of which I claimed was moving so ominously toward collectivized, dematerialized screen living. What about the other? It's somehow not enough just to say that the other is the abandoned way, some pre-digital place of living where we might have remained, but didn't. The deeper issue is more whether there is still a choice, and, if so, what that might be, and how would a person live it through? This, I would say, is the vexation of life these days, and has been for some years. How to make room for the private self, how to defend its admittedly intangible claims in the face of so much change? I have no one thought in response, but many. But I will stay with my most recent contemplation. This derives in part from Rainer Maria Rilke, from his Duino Elegies, which I picked up again the other day with the feeling that there was something there I wanted. And there was. I don't think I could deliver a summary explanation of the Elegies here. Packed with thought and spirit matter, Rilke's ten long poems take on the biggest human questions, often proceeding via what feel like obsessive digressions about love, death, self-making; if any writer has put the existential self at the core of his work, it is this poet. And if there is a 180degree reversal of the human picture Bustillos presents, Rilke is its herald. Rilke's watchword, the driving concept of the elegies, is transformation. He sees our tenancy on earth as fragile; he registers an anxiety which, though it predates the information age, is uncannily like the anxiety many of us live with every day. But where the impulse of our age is clearly toward instrumental mastery, toward what is, in effect, the invention of a parallel realm in which we all collaborate and, perhaps, move toward some kind of social merging, he offers up the difficult other course. Instead of turning from the demands imposed on individual being -- which is to say, at root, solitary being -- he urges fronting that world, taking it in, suffering it, and in the process, though with no guarantee of success, transforming it. This idea, akin to Keats' notion of "soul-making," is the gist of his great ninth Elegy. The language is at once mystical and intimate. Posing the question "why / have to be human, and, shunning Destiny, / long for Destiny?" he responds:

...because being here amounts to so much, because all this Here and Now, so fleeting, seems to require us and strangely concern us. Us the most fleeting of all. Just once, everything, only for once. Once and no more. And we, too, once. And never again. But this having been once, though only once, having been once on earth -- can it ever be cancelled?

The turn here, the vital moment, is in Rilke's saying that it is the world that needs us. What ever can he mean? It is almost as if existence were in some way a collusion between levels of animate being, our consciousness and the very different sentience of what he calls the creature world, of Nature -- as if our philosophical and psychological and spiritual purpose were to bringthat world into consciousness, raise it. But not collectively, into a noosphere, and not digitally, into a cloud of data, but subjectively, inwardly, into language. Some lines further, in one of the famous passages from this Elegy, he asks:

Are we, perhaps, here just for saying: House, Bridge, Fountain, Gate, Jug, Olive tree, Window, -- possibly: Pillar, Tower? ... but for saying, remember, oh, for such saying as never the things themselves hoped so intensely to be.

And:

Earth, isn't this what you want: an invisible re-arising in us? Is it not your dream to be one day invisible? Earth! Invisible!

We could not be further from Bustillos and her advocacy not just of Wikipedia, but what she sees as our newly ascendant mode of living -- and yet, yet, there is something both "visions" invoke, though in very different ways. This is the transformation of the old material given, the world, our natural origin. The digital path would move us away by building a new world, with new human rules, and placing it squarely atop the old. Rilke, speaking out of his age, drawing on his Nietzsche, Rodin, Cezanne, his genius influences, asks that we take the world in, swallow it in our living, and then labor to spin it into the stuff of a higher awareness. Both scenarios, I know this, sound bizarre, radically dissociated from the life of the moment any of us are likely to be in. Asked whether he believed that objects only existed when perceived, Samuel Johnson famously kicked a large stone and said: "I refute it thus." So we sit with our cup with its damp tea bag, our hatched-over day care schedule, wincing from the paper cut we just administered to ourselves, and we deem our living a clear refutation of both hive-life and transcendent subjectivity. But don't we also know other moods, other mind-states, occasions when it strikes us that the world is indeed changing, and changing in ways that escape our easy reckoning, but which sometimes waken in us, depending on the day, depending on our nature, either bursts of quiet exaltation, or else premonitions of some deeper dread?

"Inescapable digests" "A keyword-driven process"? Rubbish. I have no trouble escaping these digests, and I have no magic powers you don't have, just a better idea of what I would like to read and what I wouldn't. I don't jump from link to link either: I read what's there, and maybe click on a link if I think it might give interesting elaboration to what I've read, not really different from reading an endnote in a book (if anything, footnotes are more prominent than links, because there they are, right at the bottom of the page). In short, you sound like someone who's reading what he has no interest in because he thinks it would be good for him in some undefined way. That's just a silly thing to do. Give it up and go read quod condelectari  tibi, whether in a codex or on a screen. Or else go outside and attend to "tongues in trees, books in the running brooks / Sermons in stones, and good in everything", and then come back with new eyes.

Books  on  Paper  Fight  Analog Distractions
By  Alexis  C.  Madrigal We're  worried.  With  all  of  the  things  in  the  physical  world  --  parks  and  baseball,  cars  and  cats,  food and  drink,  duvet  covers  and  lamps  --  how  will  anyone  get  any  reading  done?

Can you concentrate on Flaubert when your cute cat is only a few feet away, or give your true devotion to Mr. Darcy when people are swimming in a pool nearby? People who read books on paper are realizing that while they really want to be reading Dostoyevsky, the real world around them is pretty distracting with all of its opportunities for interacting with people, buying things in stores, and drinking coffee. The telephone lurks tantalizingly in reach. Looking up a tricky word or unknown fact in the book is easily accomplished through yelling loudly across the room to someone who might know the answer. And some of the millions of people who have ever picked up a book only to put it back down again a few minutes have come away with the conclusion: It's hard to sit down and focus on reading. If these paragraphs strike you as silly, I agree with you. Yet, they are a nearly word for word substitution of the latest anti-e-book story in today's New York Times. "Can you concentrate on

Flaubert when Facebook is only a swipe away, or give your true devotion to Mr. Darcy while Twitter beckons?" goes the lede. This story, like many of its ilk, suffers from a baseline problem: how often were people getting distracted before and how do we know things are worse now? We notice when we are distracted by some newfangled app on a Kindle Fire. We do not notice when we are distracted by vacuuming the rug or going to watch television or daydreaming. Having read thousands of books in my day -- on paper -- I can assure you that the phenomenon of getting distracted while reading a book is not limited to e-books. So, then the question becomes: does the user interface of the book matter so much? That is to say, does the paper book provide such a different reading experience as to tilt people ineluctably towards distraction? First, the article provides no evidence aside from some people saying so: "It's like trying to cook when there are little children around," said David Myers, 53, a systems administrator in Atlanta, who got a Kindle Fire tablet in December. "A child might do something silly and you've got to stop cooking and fix the problem and then return to cooking." ... Or it's like trying to read when there are children around, regardless of format! Second, the Times does all of its analysis on what's happening in your hand, but reading is an embodied experience. We're *in the world* while we read, and there have always, always, always been distractions in physical space. If the e-reader engages you more with the thing in your hand, even though the gadget itself is more distracting, that could be a net distraction win. Third, let's assume the worst, that tablets are "temptresses" as one Times source puts it. OK. But don't we think that people will develop strategies to resist these temptations? What do we think going to the library when you need to study is? Humans respond to the novel technologies they encounter to reshape their experiences of them. If distraction is really bothering all these people, and they really want to read books, then they will find a way to do so.

Is  Google  Making  Us  Stupid?
W H AT T H E INT E R NE T IS DO ING T O O UR B R AINS

By  Nicholas  Carr Illustration by Guy Billout

"Dave, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Dave. Will you stop, Dave?" So the supercomputer HAL pleads with the implacable astronaut Dave Bowman in a famous and weirdly poignant scene toward the end of Stanley Kubrick's 2001:  A  Space  Odyssey. Bowman, having nearly been sent to a deep-space death by the malfunctioning machine, is calmly, coldly disconnecting the memory circuits that control its artificial " brain. "Dave, my mind is going," HAL says, forlornly. "I can feel it. I can feel it." I can feel it, too. Over the past few years I've had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory. My mind isn't going--so far as I can tell--but it's changing. I'm not thinking the way I used to think. I can feel it most strongly when I'm reading. Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy. My mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument, and I'd spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose. That's rarely the case anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else to do. I feel as if I'm always dragging my wayward brain back to the text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle. I think I know what's going on. For more than a decade now, I've been spending a lot of time online, searching and surfing and sometimes adding to the great databases of the Internet. The Web has been

a godsend to me as a writer. Research that once required days in the stacks or periodical rooms of libraries can now be done in minutes. A few Google searches, some quick clicks on hyperlinks, and I've got the telltale fact or pithy quote I was after. Even when I'm not working, I'm as likely as not to be foraging in the Web's info-thickets'reading and writing e-mails, scanning headlines and blog posts, watching videos and listening to podcasts, or just tripping from link to link to link. (Unlike footnotes, to which they're sometimes likened, hyperlinks don't merely point to related works; they propel you toward them.) For me, as for others, the Net is becoming a universal medium, the conduit for most of the information that flows through my eyes and ears and into my mind. The advantages of having immediate access to such an incredibly rich store of information are many, and they've been widely described and duly applauded. "The perfect recall of silicon memory," Wired's Clive Thompson has written, "can be an enormous boon to thinking." But that boon comes at a price. As the media theorist Marshall McLuhan pointed out in the 1960s, media are not just passive channels of information. They supply the stuff of thought, but they also shape the process of thought. And what the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to take in information the way the Net distributes it: in a swiftly moving stream of particles. Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski. I'm not the only one. When I mention my troubles with reading to friends and acquaintances--literary types, most of them--many say they're having similar experiences. The more they use the Web, the more they have to fight to stay focused on long pieces of writing. Some of the bloggers I follow have also begun mentioning the phenomenon. Scott Karp, who writes a blog about online media, recently confessed that he has stopped reading books altogether. "I was a lit major in college, and used to be [a] voracious book reader," he wrote. "What happened?" He speculates on the answer: "What if I do all my reading on the web not so much because the way I read has changed, i.e. I'm just seeking convenience, but because the way I THINK has changed?" Bruce Friedman, who blogs regularly about the use of computers in medicine, also has described how the Internet has altered his mental habits. "I now have almost totally lost the ability to read and absorb a longish article on the web or in print," he wrote earlier this year. A pathologist who has long been on the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, Friedman elaborated on his comment in a telephone conversation with me. His thinking, he said, has taken on a "staccato" quality, reflecting the way he quickly scans short passages of text from many sources online. "I can't read War  and  Peace   anymore," he admitted. "I've lost the ability to do that. Even a blog post of more than three or four paragraphs is too much to absorb. I skim it." Anecdotes alone don't prove much. And we still await the long-term neurological and psychological experiments that will provide a definitive picture of how Internet use affects cognition. But a recently published study of online research habits , conducted by scholars from University College London, suggests that we may well be in the midst of a sea change in the way we read and think. As part of the five-year research program, the scholars examined computer logs documenting the behavior of visitors to two popular research sites, one operated by the British Library and one by a U.K. educational consortium, that provide access to journal articles, e-books, and other sources of written information. They found that people using the sites exhibited "a form of skimming activity," hopping

from one source to another and rarely returning to any source they'd already visited. They typically read no more than one or two pages of an article or book before they would "bounce" out to another site. Sometimes they'd save a long article, but there's no evidence that they ever went back and actually read it. The authors of the study report: It is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of "reading" are emerging as users "power browse" horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense. Thanks to the ubiquity of text on the Internet, not to mention the popularity of text-messaging on cell phones, we may well be reading more today than we did in the 1970s or 1980s, when television was our medium of choice. But it's a different kind of reading, and behind it lies a different kind of thinking--perhaps even a new sense of the self. "We are not only what we read," says Maryanne Wolf, a developmental psychologist at Tufts University and the author of Proust  and  the  Squid:  The  Story and  Science  of  the  Reading  Brain. "We are how we read." Wolf worries that the style of reading promoted by the Net, a style that puts "efficiency" and "immediacy" above all else, may be weakening our capacity for the kind of deep reading that emerged when an earlier technology, the printing press, made long and complex works of prose commonplace. When we read online, she says, we tend to become "mere decoders of information." Our ability to interpret text, to make the rich mental connections that form when we read deeply and without distraction, remains largely disengaged. Reading, explains Wolf, is not an instinctive skill for human beings. It's not etched into our genes the way speech is. We have to teach our minds how to translate the symbolic characters we see into the language we understand. And the media or other technologies we use in learning and practicing the craft of reading play an important part in shaping the neural circuits inside our brains. Experiments demonstrate that readers of ideograms, such as the Chinese, develop a mental circuitry for reading that is very different from the circuitry found in those of us whose written language employs an alphabet. The variations extend across many regions of the brain, including those that govern such essential cognitive functions as memory and the interpretation of visual and auditory stimuli. We can expect as well that the circuits woven by our use of the Net will be different from those woven by our reading of books and other printed works. Sometime in 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche bought a typewriter--a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball, to be precise. His vision was failing, and keeping his eyes focused on a page had become exhausting and painful, often bringing on crushing headaches. He had been forced to curtail his writing, and he feared that he would soon have to give it up. The typewriter rescued him, at least for a time. Once he had mastered touch-typing, he was able to write with his eyes closed, using only the tips of his fingers. Words could once again flow from his mind to the page. But the machine had a subtler effect on his work. One of Nietzsche's friends, a composer, noticed a change in the style of his writing. His already terse prose had become even tighter, more telegraphic. "Perhaps you will through this instrument even take to a new idiom," the friend wrote in a letter, noting that, in his own work, his "`thoughts' in music and language often depend on the quality of pen and paper."

Also  see: Living With a Computer (July 1982) "The process works this way. When I sit down to write a letter or start the first draft of an article, I simply type on the keyboard and the words appear on the screen..." By James Fallows "You are right," Nietzsche replied, "our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts." Under the sway of the machine, writes the German media scholar Friedrich A. Kittler , Nietzsche's prose "changed from arguments to aphorisms, from thoughts to puns, from rhetoric to telegram style." The human brain is almost infinitely malleable. People used to think that our mental meshwork, the dense connections formed among the 100 billion or so neurons inside our skulls, was largely fixed by the time we reached adulthood. But brain researchers have discovered that that's not the case. James Olds, a professor of neuroscience who directs the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study at George Mason University, says that even the adult mind "is very plastic." Nerve cells routinely break old connections and form new ones. "The brain," according to Olds, "has the ability to reprogram itself on the fly, altering the way it functions." As we use what the sociologist Daniel Bell has called our "intellectual technologies"--the tools that extend our mental rather than our physical capacities--we inevitably begin to take on the qualities of those technologies. The mechanical clock, which came into common use in the 14th century, provides a compelling example. In Technics  and  Civilization, the historian and cultural critic Lewis Mumford described how the clock "disassociated time from human events and helped create the belief in an independent world of mathematically measurable sequences." The "abstract framework of divided time" became "the point of reference for both action and thought." The clock's methodical ticking helped bring into being the scientific mind and the scientific man. But it also took something away. As the late MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum observed in his 1976 book, Computer  Power  and  Human  Reason:  From  Judgment  to  Calculation, the conception of the world that emerged from the widespread use of timekeeping instruments "remains an impoverished version of the older one, for it rests on a rejection of those direct experiences that formed the basis for, and indeed constituted, the old reality." In deciding when to eat, to work, to sleep, to rise, we stopped listening to our senses and started obeying the clock. The process of adapting to new intellectual technologies is reflected in the changing metaphors we use to explain ourselves to ourselves. When the mechanical clock arrived, people began thinking of their brains as operating "like clockwork." Today, in the age of software, we have come to think of them as operating "like computers." But the changes, neuroscience tells us, go much deeper than metaphor. Thanks to our brain's plasticity, the adaptation occurs also at a biological level. The Internet promises to have particularly far-reaching effects on cognition. In a paper published in 1936, the British mathematician Alan Turing proved that a digital computer, which at the time existed only as a theoretical machine, could be programmed to perform the function of any other information-processing device. And that's what we're seeing today. The Internet, an immeasurably powerful computing system, is subsuming most of our other intellectual technologies. It's becoming our map and our clock, our printing press and our typewriter, our calculator and our telephone, and

our radio and TV. When the Net absorbs a medium, that medium is re-created in the Net's image. It injects the medium's content with hyperlinks, blinking ads, and other digital gewgaws, and it surrounds the content with the content of all the other media it has absorbed. A new e-mail message, for instance, may announce its arrival as we're glancing over the latest headlines at a newspaper's site. The result is to scatter our attention and diffuse our concentration. The Net's influence doesn't end at the edges of a computer screen, either. As people's minds become attuned to the crazy quilt of Internet media, traditional media have to adapt to the audience's new expectations. Television programs add text crawls and pop-up ads, and magazines and newspapers shorten their articles, introduce capsule summaries, and crowd their pages with easy-to-browse infosnippets. When, in March of this year, TheNew  York  Times decided to devote the second and third pages of every edition to article abstracts , its design director, Tom Bodkin, explained that the "shortcuts" would give harried readers a quick "taste" of the day's news, sparing them the "less efficient" method of actually turning the pages and reading the articles. Old media have little choice but to play by the new-media rules. Never has a communications system played so many roles in our lives--or exerted such broad influence over our thoughts--as the Internet does today. Yet, for all that's been written about the Net, there's been little consideration of how, exactly, it's reprogramming us. The Net's intellectual ethic remains obscure. About the same time that Nietzsche started using his typewriter, an earnest young man named Frederick Winslow Taylor carried a stopwatch into the Midvale Steel plant in Philadelphia and began a historic series of experiments aimed at improving the efficiency of the plant's machinists. With the approval of Midvale's owners, he recruited a group of factory hands, set them to work on various metalworking machines, and recorded and timed their every movement as well as the operations of the machines. By breaking down every job into a sequence of small, discrete steps and then testing different ways of performing each one, Taylor created a set of precise instructions--an "algorithm," we might say today--for how each worker should work. Midvale's employees grumbled about the strict new regime, claiming that it turned them into little more than automatons, but the factory's productivity soared. More than a hundred years after the invention of the steam engine, the Industrial Revolution had at last found its philosophy and its philosopher. Taylor's tight industrial choreography--his "system," as he liked to call it--was embraced by manufacturers throughout the country and, in time, around the world. Seeking maximum speed, maximum efficiency, and maximum output, factory owners used time-and-motion studies to organize their work and configure the jobs of their workers. The goal, as Taylor defined it in his celebrated 1911 treatise, The  Principles  of  Scientific  Management, was to identify and adopt, for every job, the "one best method" of work and thereby to effect "the gradual substitution of science for rule of thumb throughout the mechanic arts." Once his system was applied to all acts of manual labor, Taylor assured his followers, it would bring about a restructuring not only of industry but of society, creating a utopia of perfect efficiency. "In the past the man has been first," he declared; "in the future the system must be first."

Taylor's system is still very much with us; it remains the ethic of industrial manufacturing. And now, thanks to the growing power that computer engineers and software coders wield over our intellectual lives, Taylor's ethic is beginning to govern the realm of the mind as well. The Internet is a machine designed for the efficient and automated collection, transmission, and manipulation of information, and its legions of programmers are intent on finding the "one best method"--the perfect algorithm-- to carry out every mental movement of what we've come to describe as "knowledge work." Google's headquarters, in Mountain View, California--the Googleplex--is the Internet's high church, and the religion practiced inside its walls is Taylorism. Google, says its chief executive, Eric Schmidt, is "a company that's founded around the science of measurement," and it is striving to "systematize everything" it does. Drawing on the terabytes of behavioral data it collects through its search engine and other sites, it carries out thousands of experiments a day, according to the Harvard  Business Review, and it uses the results to refine the algorithms that increasingly control how people find information and extract meaning from it. What Taylor did for the work of the hand, Google is doing for the work of the mind. The company has declared that its mission is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." It seeks to develop "the perfect search engine," which it defines as something that "understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want." In Google's view, information is a kind of commodity, a utilitarian resource that can be mined and processed with industrial efficiency. The more pieces of information we can "access" and the faster we can extract their gist, the more productive we become as thinkers. Where does it end? Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the gifted young men who founded Google while pursuing doctoral degrees in computer science at Stanford, speak frequently of their desire to turn their search engine into an artificial intelligence, a HAL-like machine that might be connected directly to our brains. "The ultimate search engine is something as smart as people--or smarter," Page said in a speech a few years back. "For us, working on search is a way to work on artificial intelligence." In a 2004 interview with Newsweek, Brin said, "Certainly if you had all the world's information directly attached to your brain, or an artificial brain that was smarter than your brain, you'd be better off." Last year, Page told a convention of scientists that Google is "really trying to build artificial intelligence and to do it on a large scale." Such an ambition is a natural one, even an admirable one, for a pair of math whizzes with vast quantities of cash at their disposal and a small army of computer scientists in their employ. A fundamentally scientific enterprise, Google is motivated by a desire to use technology, in Eric Schmidt's words, "to solve problems that have never been solved before," and artificial intelligence is the hardest problem out there. Why wouldn't Brin and Page want to be the ones to crack it? Still, their easy assumption that we'd all "be better off" if our brains were supplemented, or even replaced, by an artificial intelligence is unsettling. It suggests a belief that intelligence is the output of a mechanical process, a series of discrete steps that can be isolated, measured, and optimized. In Google's world, the world we enter when we go online, there's little place for the fuzziness of contemplation. Ambiguity is not an opening for insight but a bug to be fixed. The human brain is just an outdated computer that needs a faster processor and a bigger hard drive.

The idea that our minds should operate as high-speed data-processing machines is not only built into the workings of the Internet, it is the network's reigning business model as well. The faster we surf across the Web--the more links we click and pages we view--the more opportunities Google and other companies gain to collect information about us and to feed us advertisements. Most of the proprietors of the commercial Internet have a financial stake in collecting the crumbs of data we leave behind as we flit from link to link--the more crumbs, the better. The last thing these companies want is to encourage leisurely reading or slow, concentrated thought. It's in their economic interest to drive us to distraction. Maybe I'm just a worrywart. Just as there's a tendency to glorify technological progress, there's a countertendency to expect the worst of every new tool or machine. In Plato's Phaedrus, Socrates bemoaned the development of writing. He feared that, as people came to rely on the written word as a substitute for the knowledge they used to carry inside their heads, they would, in the words of one of the dialogue's characters, "cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful." And because they would be able to "receive a quantity of information without proper instruction," they would "be thought very knowledgeable when they are for the most part quite ignorant." They would be "filled with the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom." Socrates wasn't wrong--the new technology did often have the effects he feared--but he was shortsighted. He couldn't foresee the many ways that writing and reading would serve to spread information, spur fresh ideas, and expand human knowledge (if not wisdom). The arrival of Gutenberg's printing press, in the 15th century, set off another round of teeth gnashing. The Italian humanist Hieronimo Squarciafico worried that the easy availability of books would lead to intellectual laziness, making men "less studious" and weakening their minds. Others argued that cheaply printed books and broadsheets would undermine religious authority, demean the work of scholars and scribes, and spread sedition and debauchery. As New York University professor Clay Shirky notes, "Most of the arguments made against the printing press were correct, even prescient." But, again, the doomsayers were unable to imagine the myriad blessings that the printed word would deliver. So, yes, you should be skeptical of my skepticism. Perhaps those who dismiss critics of the Internet as Luddites or nostalgists will be proved correct, and from our hyperactive, data-stoked minds will spring a golden age of intellectual discovery and universal wisdom. Then again, the Net isn't the alphabet, and although it may replace the printing press, it produces something altogether different. The kind of deep reading that a sequence of printed pages promotes is valuable not just for the knowledge we acquire from the author's words but for the intellectual vibrations those words set off within our own minds. In the quiet spaces opened up by the sustained, undistracted reading of a book, or by any other act of contemplation, for that matter, we make our own associations, draw our own inferences and analogies, foster our own ideas. Deep reading, as Maryanne Wolf argues, is indistinguishable from deep thinking. If we lose those quiet spaces, or fill them up with "content," we will sacrifice something important not only in our selves but in our culture. In a recent essay, the playwright Richard Foreman eloquently described what's at stake:

I come from a tradition of Western culture, in which the ideal (my ideal) was the complex, dense and "cathedral-like" structure of the highly educated and articulate personality--a man or woman who carried inside themselves a personally constructed and unique version of the entire heritage of the West. [But now] I see within us all (myself included) the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind of self--evolving under the pressure of information overload and the technology of the "instantly available." As we are drained of our "inner repertory of dense cultural inheritance," Foreman concluded, we risk turning into "`pancake people'--spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button." I'm haunted by that scene in 2001. What makes it so poignant, and so weird, is the computer's emotional response to the disassembly of its mind: its despair as one circuit after another goes dark, its childlike pleading with the astronaut--"I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm afraid"--and its final reversion to what can only be called a state of innocence. HAL's outpouring of feeling contrasts with the emotionlessness that characterizes the human figures in the film, who go about their business with an almost robotic efficiency. Their thoughts and actions feel scripted, as if they're following the steps of an algorithm. In the world of 2001, people have become so machinelike that the most human character turns out to be a machine. That's the essence of Kubrick's dark prophecy: as we come to rely on computers to mediate our understanding of the world, it is our own intelligence that flattens into artificial intelligence.

Abstract and Keywords
This chapter presents a good introduction to Roger Chartier's, The Cultural Uses of Print in Early Modern France. Fernando de Rojas' prologue clearly indicates the central tension of every history of reading--and this is why he is worthy of consideration. Reading is a creative practice, which invents singular meanings and significations that are not reducible to the intentions of authors of texts or producers of books. Rojas also implies that the history of genres, both textual and typographical, could provide the underpinnings for the history of discourse as formulated by Michel Foucault. Printing lowers the cost of the book's manufacture and shortens the time of production. Cultural history might find a new niche at the crossroads of textual criticism, the history of the book, and cultural sociology.
Keywords:   printing, reading, Fernando de Rojas, Michel Foucault, cultural history, textual criticism, book, cultural sociology

In the prologue to his Celestina, published in Saragossa in 1507, Fernando de Rojas asked himself why the work had been understood, appreciated, and used in so many different ways since its first appearance in 1499 at Burgos.1 The question is simple: how can a text that is the same for everyone who reads it become an "instrument of discord and battle between its readers, creating divergences between them, with each reader having an opinion depending on his own taste?" (instrumento de lid o contienda a sus lectores para ponerlos en diferencias, dando cada una sentencia sabre ella a sabor de su voluntad?) I will use this question, formulated by a classical author about an old text, as my point of departure in delineating basic hypotheses

for a history of practices of reading. These practices will be defined to include relationships to printed objects (which are by no means limited to books) and to the texts that readers thus encounter. For Rojas, the contrasting receptions of the text he presented to the public are due first to the readers themselves, whose (p.155) contradictory judgments can be traced not only to their diversity of characters and dispositions ("tantas y tan differentes condiciones") but also to their multiplicity of abilities and expectations. Abilities and expectations are differentiated according to age: niños, mozos, mancebos, viejos (little children, schoolboys, young fellows, old men) do not approach writing in the same way; some do not know how to read, while others have no desire to or no longer can. Abilities and expectations are also differentiated according to the highly distinct uses readers make of the same text. Rojas notes at least three readings of the tragicomedia. The first focuses not on the story as a whole but rather on certain detached episodes. It reduces the text to the status of a cuentode camino (travelers' tale), to a story told for passing time, much like the one that Sancho tells his master in part One, chapter 20, of Don Quixote. The second reading retains from the tragicomedy nothing more than easily memorized formulas, those donaires y refranes (pleasantries and proverbs) that provide cliches and ready-made expressions. These formulas are collected in the course of a reading that establishes absolutely no intimate relationship, no individual rapport, between the reader and what is read. To these practices, which mutilate the work and miss its true meaning, the author opposes the correct, profitable reading. This third reading is the one that grasps the text in its complex totality without reducing it to mere episodes of a plot or a collection of impersonal maxims. Those who read the comedia properly "will understand its essential matter and profit from it, they will be amused at its wit, and they will store away in their memories the maxims and sayings of the philosophers, in order, when the proper time comes, to use them to advantage" (coligen la surna para su provecho, ríen 10 donoso, las sentencias y diehos de filósofos guardan en su memoria para trasponer en lugares convenibles a sus aetasy propósitos). They thus put into operation a plural reading that distinguishes the comic from the serious, and that extracts the moral that best illuminates each person's life, whose "first person" is applicable to everyone. In its way, Rojas's prologue clearly indicates the central tension of every history of reading--and this is why he is worthy (p.156) of our consideration.

Should we place at the center of such a history the text given to be read or the reader who takes it up? The reader is, in effect, always thought by the author (or the commentator) to be necessarily subjugated to a single meaning, to a correct interpretation, to an authorized reading. To understand reading, in this view, would be above all to identify the discursive arrangements that constrain it and that impose on it a signification that is intrinsic and independent of any deciphering. But in thus postulating the absolute efficacy of the text tyrannically to dictate the meaning of the work to the reader, do we not in fact deny all autonomy in the act of reading? The latter is virtually absorbed and annihilated in both the explicit protocols and the implicit devices that are intended to regulate or control it. In this manner, reading is thought of as inscribed in the text, all effect automatically produced by the very strategy of writing peculiar to the work or its genre. Nevertheless, experience shows that reading is not simply submission to textual machinery. Whatever it may be, reading is a creative practice, which invents singular meanings and significations that are not reducible to the intentions of authors of texts or producers of books. Reading is a response, a labor, or, as Michel de Certeau puts it, an act of "poaching" (braconnage).2 But how do we make sense of this living, personal, striking experience? If each reading by each reader is actually a secret, singular creation, is it still possible to organize this indistinguishable plurality of individual acts according to shared regularities? Is it even possible to envision knowing anything certain about it? How can we consider at one and the same time the irreducible freedom of readers and the constraints meant to curb this freedom? This fundamental tension runs through literary criticism, which is torn between two fundamentally different approaches. On the one hand there are the approaches that deduce the reading or the reader from the text's own internal structures; on the other there are approaches--such as the phenomenology of the act of reading or "reception aesthetics"--that attempt to (p.157) locate individual or shared determinations which govern modes of interpretation from outside of the text.3 Tile tension is also central in philosophical endeavors that, like the work of Ricoeur, consider how the narrative configurations that form stories (of fiction or history) remodel the private consciousness and the temporal experience of subjects. In such a perspective, the act of reading is strategically situated at the point of "application" (Anwendurzg, in the hermeneutic lexicon) where the world of the text meets that of the reader, where the interpretation of the work ends in the interpretation of the self. Reading is to be understood as an

"appropriation" of the text, both because it actualizes the text's semantic potential and because it creates a mediation for knowledge of the self through comprehension of the text.4 In what way can a historical perspective help to resolve the contradictions in literary theory or the difficulties of phenomenological philosophy, which while defining reading as a concrete act does not consider pertinent the multiple variations that at different times and places organize its contrasting forms? History offers two approaches that are necessarily linked: reconstructing the diversity of older readings from their sparse and multiple traces, and recognizing the strategies by which authors and publishers tried to impose an orthodoxy or a prescribed reading on the text. Among these strategies, some are explicit and rely on discourse (ill prefaces, prologues, commentaries, notes), and others implicit, making of the text a machinery that by necessity must impose a comprehension held to be legitimate. Guided or trapped, the reader invariably finds himself inscribed in the text, but in turn the text is itself inscribed variously in its different readers. Thus it is necessary to bring together two perspectives that are often disjointed: on the one hand, the study of the way in which texts and the printed works that convey them organize the prescribed reading; (p.158) and on the other, the collection of actual readings tracked down in individual confessions or reconstructed on the level of communities of readers--those "interpretive communities" whose members share the same reading styles and the same strategies of interpretation.5 Let us return to our Spanish master. For. Rojas. the diverse opinions on the Celestina are to be linked first to the many differences in abilities, expectations, and predispositions of its readers. But the opinions also depend on how the readers "read" the text. It is clear that Rojas addresses a reader who reads the prologue to himself, in silence, in private. Yet not all readings of the tragicomedy are of this nature: "So then, when ten persons congregate to hear this play there will naturally be a variety of reactions among them. Who will deny that there will arise dissension about something which may be understood in so many different ways?" (Así que cuando diez personas se juntaren a oír esta comedia, en quien quepa esta diferencia de condiciones, come suele acaecer, ¿quién negará que haya contienda en cosa que de tantas maneras se entienda?). Ten listeners gathered around a text read out loud: here "reading" is actually listening to speech that is read. The practice was common, for in the edition of 1500 the "corrector de la irnpresian" tells how the text should be read aloud. One of the stanzas that he adds to the work is entitled "On the way to read this

tragicomedy" (Dice el modo que se ha de tener leyendo esta tragicomedia). The "lector" he envisions must know how to vary the tone, play the parts of all the characters, convey asides by speaking through his teeth--in short, mobilize "a thousand arts and methods" (mil artes y modos) of reading in order to capture the attention of "los oyentes," the listeners. Along with the Celestina, other texts such as pastorals or chivalric romances are the favored texts of these readings, where, for a few people, the spoken word offers a written text even to those who could read it themselves. Rojas's notation opens several paths of inquiry. The first concerns the sociability of reading, a fundamental counterpoint to the privatization of the act of reading, to its retreat into the intimacy (p.159) of solitude. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, reading out loud survived in the tavern and the coach, the salon and the café, in high society and in the household. This history remains to be written.6. A second path leads to the analysis of the relationship between textuality and orality. To be sure, between the culture of the tale and of storytelling on the one hand and that of writing on the other the differences are great, and aptly characterized by Cervantes in the passage from Don Quixote cited above.7 To pass the time while standing gllard one night, Sancho undertakes to tell stories to his master. But his method--interrupting the account with commentaries and digressions that result in repetition upon repetition and that project the narrator into the story and relate the story back to the present situationmakes his listener wildly impatient: "If thou tellest thy tale in this manner, cried Don Quixote, repeating every circumstance twice over, it will not be finished these two days; proceed therefore, connectedly, and rehearse it, like a man of understanding: otherwise, thou hadst better hold thy tongue" (Si desa manera cuentas tu cuento, Sancho--dijo don Quijote--, repitiendo dos veces lo que vas diciendo, no acabarás ell dos días; dilo seguidamente, y cuéntalo como hombre de entendimiento, y si no, no digas nada.) A man of books par excellence, even to crazy excess, Don Quixote becomes irritated by a story that lacks the form of those he ordinarily reads; Quixote really wants Sancho's recitation to conform to the rules of linear, objective, hierarchical writing. The distance between these expectations of a reader and the oral practice as Sancho learned it is insurmountable: "In my country, answered Sancho, all the old stories are told in this manner, neither can I tell it in any other; nor is it civil in your worship, to desire I should change the custom" (De la misma manera que yo lo cuento--respondi6 Sancho--se cuentan en mi tierra todas las consejas, (p.160) y yo no sé contarlo de otra, ni es bien que vuestra merced me pide que haga usos nuevos). Resigned, Don Quixote reluctantly agrees to listen to this text that is so different from

those contained in his precious books: "Take thy own way, said the Knight, and since it is the will of fate, that I should hear thee, pray go on" (Di como quisieres--respondió don Quijote--; que pues la suerte quiere que no pueda dejar de escucharte, prosigue). The discrepancy, then, between the spoken recitation and the printed script is great. We must bear in mind, however, that the links between the two are numerous. For one thing, formulas of oral culture are often inscribed in texts destined for a large public. Occasionnels (ephemera, yet having perhaps a longer life than the English term implies) that use in written form the storytellers' methods of recitation or the variations introduced in the popular editions. of fairy tales by borrowing from folkloric traditions are good examples of these joinings of the spoken with the printed word.8 Moreover, this continuing dependence assures the return of multiple texts into oral forms, where they are destined to be read aloud: for example, in monastic. exercises or preaching, in reading for pleasure or family teaching. But for Rojas there is another reason that could confound the understanding of the text he offered to his readers: the unfortunate intervention of the printers themselves. He in effect deplores the additions they felt they could make, against his will and against the recommendations of the ancients: "The very printers have wounded the text: they have put unnecessary headings and summaries at the beginning of the acts, which was a custom not followed by ancient authors" (Que aun los impresores han dado sus pinturas, poniendo rubricas a sumarios al principia de cada acto, narrando en breve lo que dentro contenia: una cosa bien escusada, segun lo que los antiguos escritores usaron). This observation can establish a fundamental distinction between the text and print, between the work of writing and that of making the book. As an American bibliographer justly observed, "Whatever they may do, authors do not write books. Books are not written at all. They are manufactured by scribes and other artisans, by mechanics and other engineers, and by printing presses and other machines."9 In contrast to the representation of the ideal, abstract text--which is stable because it is detached from all materiality, a representation elaborated by literature itself--it is essential to remember that no text exists outside of the support that enables it to be read; any comprehension of a writing, no matter what kind it is, depends on the forms in which it reaches its reader. Thus a sorting out of two types of apparatus becomes necessary, between those entailed by the putting into text, the strategies of writing, the intentions of the "author," and those

resulting from the manufacture of the book or publication, produced by editorial decision or through workshop procedures, which are aimed at readers or readings that may not be at all like those the author intended, This gap, which is the space in which meaning is constructed, has too often been overlooked, not only by the classical approaches, which consider the work itself as a pure text whose typographical forms do not matter, but also by reception theory (Rezeptionstheorie), which postulates a direct, immediate relationship between the "text" and the reader, between the "textual signals" used by the author and the "horizon of expectation" of those he addresses. Here, it seems to me, we find an illegitimate simplification of the process by which works take on meaning. Restoration of its true complexity requires consideration of the close-knit relationship among three poles: the text itself, the object that conveys the text, and the act that grasps it. Variations in this triangular relationship produce in effect changes in meaning, which can be organized in a few models. First, there is the case of a stable text presented for reading in printed forms that themselves change. In studying the variations in the printing of (p.162) William Congreve's plays in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, D. F. MacKenzie was able to show how apparently small and limited typographical transformations (the shift from a format of quarto to octavo, the use of an ornament to separate scenes, the numbering of episodes with roman numerals, the list of characters' names at the beginning of each scene, the mention of who enters and who exits, the indication of the speaker's name) had major effects on the status given to the work, on how it was read, even on the way the author himself considered it. A new readability was created by the format, which made the book easier to carry, and by the layout, which restored something of the dramatic sense of movement and of time in print. A new readability, but also a new horizon of reception, for the forms used in the 1710 octavo edition had seemingly "classicized" the text--which might be what led Congreve to purify the writing here and there, in order to make it conform to the text's new legitimacy.10 In the same way, it seems to me that the editorial history of Moliere's comedies has a significant impact on the reconstruction of contemporary understandings of them. With George Dundin, for example, four changes must be taken into account. First, there was a shift from separate editions of the play in the form of small books that were closely linked with performances, to its publication as part of edited series, individually or in continuous pagination, whereby the play was inscribed in a corpus and its

meaning contaminated by its proximity to other comedies. Second, as print became theatricalized, beginning with the 1682 edition the number of stage directions, particularly the cues, progressively multiplied, thus allowing Molière's sense of the scene to be preserved in readings detached from the immediacy of the performance. Third, the introduction of illustrations, also in 1682, required a series of choices to be made (which scene to illustrate, how to represent characters and interpret stage directions) and constituted a protocol of reading (p.163) for the text that it accompanied. And fourth, after 1734 a single edition appeared, containing the comedy itself, the text of the pastoral in which the comedy had been inserted, and the account of the 1668 festival at Versailles where both had been included during the first performance--as if at the beginning of tile eighteenth century the play, now situated at a historical distance, was supposed to be restored to the context of its creation. Thus tile text, unchanged since the first editions in 1669, now changes because the apparatus ill which it is to be read has changed.11 The second model concerns the way in which changes in the printed form of a text govern the transformations in its meaning. This is the case, for example, with the titles in tile corpus of French chapbooks (the "Bibliothèque bleue"), an editorial formula aimed at winning over the most numerous (and most popular) readership between 1700 and the mid 1800s. The common characteristics of these editions are above all material and commercial. The material side of publication involved paperbound books, covered generally with blue paper (but also red or marbled), printed with type that was old and mismatched, illustrated with second-hand woodcuts, and with a picture frequently taking the place of the publisher's insignia on the title page. Commercially, even if the length of the works varied, their prices always remained low, much lower than those books that were produced for a more refined and thus more expensive market. Thus, the Bibliothèque bleue required that costs be calculated quite precisely so that a book could be sold at the lowest possible price. The texts of the Bibliothèque bleue were not written for such editorial ends. The politics of the inventors of the formula (the printers of Troyes, later copied in Rouen, Caen. Limoges, and Avignon) consisted of picking out from a repertoire of already published texts those works that seemed to them to meet the expectations and abilities of the vast public they hoped to attract. From this formula, two essential corollaries followed: the texts published as chapbooks were not "popular" in and of (p.164) themselves but came from all genres, from all eras, and from all kinds of literature, and all had already enjoyed a relatively long editorial life in classic published

form before becoming a part of the Bibliothèque bleue. Thus devotional literature and religious exercises, fairy tales and novels, and handbooks all were included. Between publication of the original text and manufacture of the chapbook edition, the gap could be great and was always marked by a series of editions with nothing "popular" about them. The cultural specificity of the materials published in the Bibliothèque bleue, then, stemmed not from the erudite and diverse texts themselves but from editorial intervention intended to make them conform to the reading ability of the buyers whom the publishers wanted to attract. This work of adaptation modified the text as it was given in the previous edition, which in turn served as copy for the printers of "popular" books. The adaptation was informed by the image the printers had of the competence and cultural expectations of readers who were unfamiliar with books. The printers undertook three kinds of transformations of the text: they shortened the texts, removed chapters, episodes, or digressions deemed superfluous, and simplified the wording by stripping sentences of their relative and incidental clauses; they broke up the text by creating new chapters and adding paragraphs, titles, and summaries: and they censored allusions deemed to be blasphemous or sacrilegious, descriptions considered licentious, and scatological or indecent expressions. The logic behind this adaptive work was thus twofold: it aimed to control the texts by submitting them to the demands of Counter-Reform religion and morals, while at the same time intending to make them more accessible to inexperienced readers. The implicit reading that such a work sought to create can be characterized as a reading that required visible landmarks (hence anticipatory titles and summary recapitulations, or even woodcuts functioning as protocols of reading or mnemonic devices). This kind of reading was comfortable only with brief, self-contained, often disjointed sequences and apparently was satisfied with minimal global coherence. This manner of reading (p.165) was not at all that of the literate elites, who were familiar with books and adept at deciphering and mastering texts in their entirety. Unlike the scholar, the rudimentary reader could tolerate the dross left in the text by hasty and cheap manufacturing processes (for example, the countless misprints, cuts in the wrong places, confusions of names and words, multiple errors). Chapbook readers (or at least the majority of them, for notables too bought the books for pleasure, curiosity, or collecting) read in what seems to have been a discontinuous, fragmented way that accommodated gaps and incoherences.

The rudimentary reader was also comfortable with books that included texts he already knew, at least partially or approximately. Often read out loud-- but not only (or perhaps not at all) during those evenings devoted to public readings called veillées--the chapbooks could be memorized by listeners who, when actually faced with the books, recognized them more than they discovered them. And more generally, even outside of this direct listening, most people read books with a previously gained knowledge that was easily evoked in the act of reading. This knowledge was gained from the recurrence of coded forms, from the repetition of themes, and from the books' images (even if these originally had no relation to the text they illustrated). This "preknowledge," as it were, was mobilized to produce comprehension of what was read--a comprehension not necessarily in conformity with that desired by the producer of the text or the maker of the book, or with that which a sharp and well-informed reading could construct. "Popular" reading can thus be traced to these particularities, both formal and typographic (taking the latter in the largest sense of the term, as found, for example, in MacKenzie), of the publication of the chapbooks and to the modifications they imposed on the texts on which they were based. In this context, then, popular reading is understood as a relation to the text unlike that of literate culture. A third model of this relationship among text, book, and understanding appears when a text that is stable in content and fixed in form becomes the object of contrasting readings. "A book is changed by the fact that it does not change even when (p.166) the world changes," declared Pierre Bourdieu.12 To make the proposition compatible with the smaller scale of this essay, let us add: "even when its mode of reading changes." We need to develop indicators of the major divisions that can organize a history of reading practices (of the use of texts, even the uses of the same text)--for example between reading out loud, for oneself or for others, and reading in silence; between reading inwardly and privately and reading publicly; between religious reading and lay reading; and between "intensive" reading and "extensive" reading (to borrow the terminology of R. Engelsing).13 eyond these macroscopic cleavages, the historian must seek to determine the dominant paradigms of reading in a community of readers in a given time and place. These include, for example, the Puritan readings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries or the "Rousseauist" reading of the Enlightenment or, yet again, the "agical" reading of traditional peasant societies. Each of these "manners of reading" has its own specific gestures, its proper uses of the book, and its particular referential text (the Bible, the Nouvelle Héloise, the Grand and Petit Albert). The mode of reading, which is

dictated by the book itself or by its interpreters, provides the archetype of all reading, whatever kind it may be.14 Characterization of these modes of reading is therefore indispensable to any approach that aims to. reconstruct how texts could be apprehended, understood, and handled. The final remarks of Rojas in the prologue of the Celestina concern the very genre of the text: "Others have made quite a to-do about the name of the play, saying it was not a comedy (p.167) but a tragedy, since it ended so sadly. The first author wished to give it a description that would reflect what happens in the beginning, and so he called it a comedy. I have found myself in a dilemma, and I have cut the Gordian knot by calling the playa tragicomedy" (Otros han litigado sobre el nombre, diciendo que no se había de llamar comedia, pues acababa en tristeza, sino que se llamase tragedia. E1 primer auctor quiso dar denominación del principio, que fue placer, y llamóla comedia. Yo, viendo estas discordias, entre estos estremos partí agora por medio la porfía, y llarnéla tragicomedia). The notation leads to two series of reflections. First and foremost, it reminds us that the explicit indicators by which texts are designated and classified create expectations of the reading and anticipations of understanding. That is the case as well for the indication of the genre, which links the text to be read to other texts that have already been read and which signals to the reader the appropriate "preknowledge" in which to locate the text. A similar process takes place with purely formal or material indicators-- the format and the image, for example. From the folio to smaller formats, a hierarchy exists that links the format of the book, the genre of the text, and the moment and mode of reading. In the eighteenth century Lord Chesterfield bore witness to this fact: "Solid folios are the people of business with whom I converse in the morning. Quartos are the easier mixed company with whom I sit after dinner; and I pass my evenings ill the light, and often frivolous chitchat of small octavos and duodecimos."15 Such a hierarchy is, moreover, directly inherited from the days when books were copied by hand. This hierarchy distinguished the book that had to be laid flat in order to be read; the humanist book, which was more manageable in its medium format and suitable for both classic and newer texts; and the portable book, the libellus, a pocketbook and bedside book with multiple uses and more numerous readers.16 The image (p.168) on the frontispiece or title page, along the border of the text, or on the last page also classified the text and suggested a reading. It provided the protocol of the reading, the identifying index.

Rojas also leads us to think that the history of genres, both textual and, typographical, could provide the underpinnings for the history of discourse as formulated by Foucault.17 Understanding the series of discourses in their discontinuity, stripping principles of their regularity, and identifying their particular rationalities all presuppose, I believe, that the constraints and demands of the very forms in which they are to be read be taken into account. Hence we must pay attention to the laws of production and to the obligatory devices governing every class or series of texts that have become books--the lives of saints as well as the books of hours, the occasionnels and Bibliothèque bleue, the folhetos de cordel and chapbooks, the emblem books and programs of civic processions, and so on. Hence, moreover, we must trace the shifts from one genre to another, when a given form becomes invested with issues that are normally foreign to it or with themes that are generally expressed elsewhere and in other ways. In the seventeenth century, for example, at the time of the acute crisis known as the Fronde, the "general politicization of printing" placed all textual and typographic genres of large circulation and public reading (from the letter to the gazette, from the song to the narrative account) at the disposal of the conflicting parties.18 The critical and genealogical study of discourses in series can thus find support in a project that takes each text or collection of texts and considers the intersections between the history of the variations in their content and the history of the transformations they undergo when being put into print. These working hypotheses are backed by several critical reevaluations that call into question the certainties and habits of French cultural history. The first concerns the classic uses of the (p.169) notion of popular culture. This notion no longer appears to hold up against three fundamental doubts. First and foremost, it 110 longer seems tenable to try to establish strict correspondences between cultural cleavages and social hierarchies, creating simplistic relationships between particular cultural objects or forms and specific social groups. On the contrary, it is necessary to recognize the fluid circulation and shared practices that cross social boundaries. Numerous examples exist of the "popular" uses of objects, ideas, and codes that were not considered as such (think of the readings of Menocchio, the Friulian miller):19 conversely, the rejection by the dominant culture of forms rooted ill the common culture came late. Second, it does not seem possible to identify the absolute difference and the radical specificity of popular culture on the basis of its own texts, beliefs, or codes. The materials that convey the practices and thoughts of ordinary people are always mixed, blending forms and themes, invention and tradition, literate culture and folklore.

Finally, the macroscopic opposition between "popular" and "high" culture has lost its pertinence. An inventory of the multiple divisions that fragment the social body is preferable to this massive partition, which often defines the common people by default as the collection of those outside elite society. Their ordering follows several principles that make manifest the divergences or oppositions between men and women, townspeople and rural folk, Protestants and Catholics, but also between generations, occupations, and neighborhoods. For far too long, French sociocultural history has accepted a reductive definition of the social, identified only with the hierarchy of wealth and its conditions. This approach has lost sight of the fact that other differences, based on gender as well as on territorial or religious affiliations, were also clearly social. Such differences could make sense of the plurality of cultural practices, proving at least as and perhaps more effective than the opposition of dominant/dominated or the socioprofessional hierarchy. (p.170) Thus, because it ignores borrowings and exchanges, because it masks the multiplicity of differences, because it presupposes a priori the validity of a set of divisions that remains to be established, the concept of popular culture--which provided the foundation for the first pioneering studies about chapbooks--must now be called into question. We must likewise question the long-recognized contrast between the completely oral and gestural forms of so-called traditional cultures on the one hand and the circulation of writing, first in manuscript and then in printed form, on the other, a contrast that delimits a separate, minority culture. The division has encouraged the partitioning of the approaches to these two modes of cultural acquisition and transmission; it has rigidly separated historical anthropology (which, even if it works with texts, is attached to systems of gestures, to the use of words, and to ritual apparatuses) from a more classic cultural history dedicated to studying the production and circulation of writing. Thus formulated, the opposition of oral and written fails to account for the situation that existed from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century when media and multiple practices still overlapped. Some of these overlaps associate the spoken word and writing: either a spoken word fixes itself in writing or, conversely, a text returns in oral form through the mediation of reading out loud. Other overlaps connect writings and gestures. Numerous texts overtly aim to negate their own status as discourse in order to produce, at the practical level, behavior or practices held to be legitimate or useful. Manuals on how to prepare for death, books on religious exercises, guides to good manners, and handbooks

are among many examples of genres that attempt to internalize necessary or appropriate gestures. Furthermore, writing is installed at the very heart of the most central forms of traditional culture; festivals or entries, for instance, are surrounded by written notices of all kinds and commented on in programs that explain their meaning, and ecclesiastical rituals often require written objects to be placed at the center of the ceremony. The history of cultural practices must consider these interpenetrations and restore some of the complex trajectories that run from the spoken word to the written text, from (p.171) writing that is read to gestures that are performed, from the printed book to reading aloud. One concept seems useful here, that of appropriation: because, understood more sociologically than phenomenologically, the notion of appropriation makes it possible to appreciate the differences in cultural apportionment, in the creative invention that lies at the very heart of the reception process. A retrospective sociology that has long made the unequal distribution of objects the primary criterion of the cultural hierarchy must be replaced by a different approach that focuses attention on differentiated and contrasting uses of the same goods, the same texts, and the same ideas. Such a perspective does not preclude identifying differences (including socially rooted differences), but it displaces the very arena of their identification because it no longer involves social qualification of tile works as a whole (for example, designation of Bibliothèque bleue texts as "popular literature"). Instead, it characterizes the practices that differentially appropriate the materials circulating in a given society. The statistical approach that once seemed to dominate French cultural history and that sought to weigh the unequal social distribution of serializable objects, discourses, and acts therefore no longer suffices. By presuming overly simplistic correspondences between social levels and cultural boundaries and seizing upon the most repetitive and reductionist expressions of ideas and behaviors, such a course misses the essential, that is, the contrasting manner in which groups or individuals utilize shared themes or forms. Without abandoning the measures and the series, the history of texts and of books must be above all a reconstitution of variations in practices--in other words, a history of reading. Thought of in this way, the emphasis on cultural appropriations also enables us to see that texts or words intended to mold thoughts and actions are never wholly effective and radically acculturating. The practices of appropriation always create uses or representations that are hardly reducible

to the wills or intentions of those who produce discourse and norms. During the Catholic reform, for instance, the imposition of new devotions was accompanied by recastings and reinterpretations (p.172) that profoundly transformed them. The devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, which was central in post-Tridentine pastoral work and iconography, was strongly contaminated by the ancient cult of relics and subverted by a demand for exteriorization that insisted on public and spectacular practices (the exposition of the sacrament, the benediction, and the procession) no longer easily accepted by ecclesiastical authority. And the devotion to the Rosary often reasserted the gestures and meanings traditionally attached to the cult of the Virgin of Mercy.20 Between the institution and the community, between the normative model and the collective experience, the game was always two way. So-called popular religion was at once acculturated and acculturating: neither totally controlled nor absolutely free, it affirmed the specific modes of belief at the very core of the acceptance of new models of spirituality. By the same token, the act of reading cannot be effaced in the text itself, nor can significations be annihilated in imposed meanings. The acceptance of messages and models always operates through adjustments, arrangements, or resistances. That is the lesson of Richard Hoggart's book The Uses of Literacy.21 In 1950S England, the culture of the popular classes, far from being reduced to that embodied in the productions of mass culture, was characterized by a relationship of defiance and defensiveness vis-á-vis the messages it received and consumed. Large-circulation newspapers, tabloids, advertisements, horoscopes, and songs are always the object of an oblique or distracted attention that reads or understands them with pleasure and suspicion, at once fascinated and distanced. Belief and disbelief go together, and the acceptance of the truth in what one reads or hears does not diminish the fundamental doubts retained about this presumed authenticity. Does Haggart in fact provide a key for understanding the particularity of the relationship between the least literate public and the texts that aim to govern and distract them, from the Bibliothèque bleue to the (p.173) soap opera? Or is it better to place this characterization within the longue durée of differential modes of belief that can ascertain similar ambivalences at completely other social levels in other historical situations?22 At any rate, Hoggart's work reminds us of the reader's creative autonomy in the face of the machineries that try to control him. Here, the idea of appropriation is not taken in the sense defined by Foucauit in Discourse on Language. Foucault considered the "social appropriation

of discourses" as a procedure that controls them and an apparatus that limits their distribution--in other words, as one of the grand systems of the subjugation of discourse.23 My perspective is different without being contradictory, because it focuses attention not on exclusions by confiscation but on the differences within shared usage, such as those indicated by Pierre Bourdieu: "The taste, propensity and aptitude for appropriation (material and/or symbolic) of a specific class of objects or of classified or classifying practices, is the generating formula behind style of life. It is a unitary ensemble of distinctive preferences which express the same intention in the specific logic of each one of the symbolic subspaces."24 Which is to say that contrasting practices must be understood as competitions, that their differences are organized by strategies of distinction or imitation, and that the diverse uses of the same cultural goods are rooted in the stable predispositions proper to each group. Consequently, we have a choice between two models for making sense of texts, books, and their readers. The first contrasts discipline and invention, presenting these categories not as antagonistic but as an interrelated pair. Every textual or typographic arrangement that aims to create control and constraint always secretes tactics that tame or subvert it; conversely, there is no production or cultural practice that does not rely on materials imposed by tradition, authority, or the market and (p.174) that is not subjected to surveillance and censures from those who have power over words or gestures. Thus, a presumed "popular" spontaneity cannot be simply opposed to the coercions imposed by the authorities; what must be recognized is how liberties that are always restrained (by conventions, codes, constraints) and disciplines that are always upset articulate with each other. Discipline and invention must be considered, but so must distinction and divulgation. This second pair of interdependent ideas enables us to posit an understanding of the circulation of objects and cultural models that is not reductive to a simple process of diffusion, one generally thought to descend along the social ladder. The processes of imitation or vulgarization are more complex and more dynamic and must be considered, above all, as struggles of competition. In these struggles every divulgation, conceded or won, produces simultaneously the search for a new distinction. Thus, once the book became a more common object and less distinctive by its being merely possessed, the manners of reading took over the task of showing variations, of making manifest differences in the social hierarchy. Simplistic, rigid representations of social domination or cultural diffusion must thus be replaced. Following Elias and Bourdieu, we can develop a means of

understanding that recognizes the reproduction of distances at the very interior of the mechanisms of imitation, competition in the midst of sharing, and the constitution of new distinctions in the very processes of disclosure.25 These hypotheses and ideas enable us to attempt the study of print practices in former societies. These practices are a good entry point into European culture of the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries for two reasons. First, they fix or convey speech, which means that they cement sociabilities and prescribe behavior, cross into both private and public space, and give rise to belief, imagination, and action. They overturn the whole culture, coming to terms with traditional forms of communication (p.175) and establishing new distinctions. Second, they permit the circulation of writing on an unprecedented scale. Printing lowers the cost of the book's manufacture because the cost is distributed among all the copies of an edition rather than being supported by a single copy. In addition, printing shortens the time of production, which was very long for books in manuscript. After Gutenberg, the entire culture of the West could be considered a culture of print, because the products of presses and typographical composition, rather than being reserved for administrative and ecclesiastical uses as in China or Korea, themselves influenced all relations and practices. We are left with a twofold ambition and a twofold task. On a small scale, we must understand the multiple, differentiated, contradictory uses of print, because competing authorities had faith in its powers and readers handled it according to their abilities or their expectations.26 From a larger perspective, we must reinscribe the emergence of the printing press in the long-term history of the forms of the book or the supports of texts (from the volumen to the codex, from the book to the screen) and in the history of reading practices. Here, cultural history might find a new niche at the crossroads of textual criticism, the history of the book, and cultural sociology.

Preface

In bringing together under this title the three essays that make up this book I hope to highlight a question that runs all through it: how did people in Western Europe between the end of the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century attempt to master the enormously increased number of texts that first the manuscript book and then print put into circulation? Inventorying titles, categorizing works, and attributing texts were all operations that made it possible to set the world of the written word in order. Our own age is the direct heir of this immense effort motivated by anxiety. It was in those decisive centuries, when the hand-copied book was gradually replaced by works composed in movable type and printed on presses, that the acts and thoughts that are still our own were forged. The invention of the author as the fundamental principle for the designation of a text, the dream of a universal library, real or imaginary, containing all the works that have ever been wirtten, and the ernergence of a new definition of the book that made an indissoluble connection between an object, a text, and an author these are some of the innovations that transformed

Preface
people's relationship with texts, both before and after Gutenberg. That relationship typically contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, every reader has to deal with an entire set of constraints and obligations. The author, the bookseller-publisher, the commentator, and the censor all have an interest in keeping close control over the production of meaning and in making sure that the text that they have written, published, glossed, or authorized will be understood with no possible deviation from their prescriptive will. On the other hand, reading, by definition, is rebellious and vagabond. Readers use infinite numbers of subterfuges to procure prohibited books, to read between the lines, and to subvert the lessons imposed on them. The hook always aims at installing an order, whether it is the order in which it is deciphered, the order in which it is to be understood, or the order intended by the authority who commanded or permitted the work. This multifaceted order is not all-powerful, however, when it comes to annulling the reader's liberty. Even when it is hemmed in by differences in competence and by conventions, liberty knows how to distort and reformulate the significations that were supposed to defeat it. The dialectic between imposition and appropriation, between constraints transgressed and freedoms bridled, is not the same in all places or all times or for all people. Recognizing its diverse modalities and multiple variations is the first aim of a history of reading that strives to grasp - in all their differences communities of readers and their 'arts of reading'. The order of books has still another meaning. Whether they are in manuscript or in print, books are objects whose forms, if they cannot impose the sense of the texts that they bear, at least command the uses that can invest them

and the approprtattons to which they are susceptible. Works and discourses exist only when they become physical realities and are inscribed on the pages of a book, transmitted by a voice reading or narrating, or spoken on the stage of a theatre. Understanding the principles that govern the 'order of discourse' supposes that the principles underlying the processes of production, communication, and reception of books (and other objects that bear writing) will also be deciphered in a rigorous manner. More than even before, historians of literary works and historians of cultural practices have become aware of the effects of meaning that material forms produce. In the case of the book, those forms constitute a singular order totally distinct from other registers of transmission of the canonical works as ordinary texts. This means that, even though it is not emphasized in the present book, keen attention should be paid to the technical, visual, and physical devices that organize the reading of writing when writing becomes a book. This work has another aim in its three chapters: to initiate more general reflection on the reciprocal relations between the two meanings that we spontaneously give to the term 'culture'. The first designates the works and the acts that lend themselves to aesthetic or intellectual appreciation in any given society; the second aims at ordinary, banal practices that express the way in which a community - on any scale - experiences and conceives of its relationship with the world, with others, and with itself. Works - even the greatest works, especially the greatest works - have no stable, universal, fixed meaning. They are invested with plural and mobile significations that are constructed in the encounter between a proposal and a reception. The meanings attributed to their forms and

their themes depend upon the areas of competence or the expectations of the various publics that take hold of them. To be sure, the creators {or the 'powers' or the 'clerics') always aspire to pin down their meaning and proclaim the correct interpretation, the interpretation that ought to constrain reading (or viewing). But without fail reception invents, shifts about, distorts. Works are produced within a specific order that has its own rules, conventions, and hierarchies, but they escape all these and take on a certain density in their peregrinations - which can be in a very long time span - about the social world. Deciphered on the basis of mental and affective schemes that constitute the 'culture' {in the anthropological sense) of the communities that receive them, works turn the tables and become a precious resource for thinking about what is essential: the construction of social ties, individual subjectivity, and relationship with the sacred. Conversely, any work inscribes within its forms and its themes a relationship with the manner in which, in a given moment and place, modes of exercising power, social configurations, or the structure of personality are organized. Thought of (and thinking of himself or herself) as a demiurge, the writer none the less creates in a state of dependence. Dependence upon the rules (of patronage, subsidy, and the market) that define the writer's condition. Dependence (on an even deeper level) on the unconscious detern1inations that inhabit the work and that make it conceivable, communicable, and decipherable. To consider in this way that all works are anchored in the practices and the institutions of the social world is not to postulate any general equivalence among all the products of the mind. Some, better than others, never exhaust

their significative force. If we try to understan4 this by invoking the universality of beauty or the unity of human nature we will fall short of the truth. The essential gan1e is being played elsewhere, in the complex, subtle, shifting relationships established between the forms (symbolic or material) proper to works, which are unequally open to appropriation, and the habits or the concerns of the various publics for those works. What any cultural history must take into consideration today is the paradoxical articulation between a dljference the difference by means of which all societies, with varying modalities, have separated out from daily practice a particlar domain of huntan activity - and dependencies - the dependencies that take a variety of ways to inscribe aesthetic and intellectual invention within the conditions of possibility and intelligibility. This problematic connection is rooted in the very trajectory that gives works their most powerful meanings - meanings constructed on the aesthetic or reflective transfiguration of ordinary experiences, grasped on the basis of practices proper to those works' various publics. Reflection on how the figure of the author was constructed, on the rules for the formation of communities of readers, or on the significance invested in the building of libraries (with or without walls) may perhaps contribute to focusing a few of the questions that currently inhabit the disciplines of knowledge and public debate. By reintroducing variation and difference where the illusion of universality spontaneously springs up, such reflection may help us to get rid of some of our over-sure distinctions and some over-familiar truisms.

Far from being writers - founders of their own place, heirs of the peasants of earlier ages now working on the soil of language, diggers of wells and builders of houses readers are travellers; they move across lands belonging to someone else, like nomads poaching their way across fields they did not write, despoiling the wealth of Egypt to enjoy it themselves. Writing accumulates, stocks up, resists time by the establishment of a place and multiplies its production through the expansionism of reproduction. Reading takes no measures against the erosion of time (one forgets oneself and also forgets), it does not keep what it acquires, or it does so poorly, and each of the places through which it passes is a repetition of the lost paradise. 1 This magnificent passage from Michel de Certeau which contrasts writing - conservative, fixed, durable - and reading - always of the order of the ephemeral - constitutes both an obligatory base and a disquieting challenge for any history that hopes to inventory and make sense out of a practice (reading) that only rarely leaves traces, that is scattered in an infinity of singular acts, and that easily

Communities of Readers
shakes off all constraints. Such a proposal is based on a dual presupposition: that reading is not already inscribed in the text with no conceivable gap between the meaning assigned to it (by its author, by custom, by criticism, and so forth) and the interpretation that its readers might make of it; and, as a corollary, that a text exists only because there is a reader to give it meaning. To return to Michel de Certeau:
Whether it is a question of newspapers or Proust, the text has a meaning only through its readers; it changes along with them; it is ordered in accord with codes of perception that it does not control. It becomes a text only in its relation to the exteriority of the reader; by an interplay of implications and ruses between two sorts of 'expectation' in combination: the expectation that organizes a readable space (a literality), and one that organizes a procedure necessary for the actualization of the work (a reading). 2

The historian's task is thus to reconstruct the variations that differentiate the espaces lisibles - that is, the texts in their discursive and material forms - and those that ·govern the circumstances of their tffectuation - that is, the readings, understood as concrete practices and as procedures of interpretation. Michel de Certeau's suggestions provide a basis for suggesting some of what is at stake and the problems and conditions of possibility of this sort of history. Its space is usually defined by three poles that the academic tradition usually keeps separate: first, the analysis of texts, be they canonical or ordinary, to discern their structures, their themes, and their aims; second, the history of books and, beyond that, the history of all objects and all forms that bear texts; third, the study of practices that seize on

these objects and these forms in a variety of ways and produce differentiated uses and meanings. For me, a fundamental question underlies this approach that combines textual criticism, bibliography, and cultural history: in the societies of the ancien regime, how did increased circulation of printed matter transform forms of sociability, permit new modes of thought, and change people's relationship with power? Hence the need to stress the way in which the encounter between 'the world of the text' and 'the world of the reader' - to use Paul Ricoeur's terms - operates. 3 To reconstruct this process of the 'actualization' of texts in its historical dimensions first requires that we accept the notion that their meanings are dependent upon the forms through which they are received and appropriated by their readers (or hearers). Readers and hearers, in point of fact, are never confronted with abstract or ideal texts detached from all materiality; they manipulate or perceive objects and forms whose structures and modalities govern their reading (or their hearing), thus the possible comprehension of the text read (or heard). Against a purely semantic definition of the text (which inhabits not only structuralist criticism in all its variants but also the literary theories most attuned to a reconstruction of the reception of works), one must state that forms produce meaning and that a text, stable in its letter, is invested with a new meaning and status when the mechanistns that make it available to interpretation change. We must also keep in mind that reading is always a practice embodied in acts, spaces, and habits. Far from being a phenomenology that wipes out all concrete modalities of the act of reading and characterizes that act by its effects, which are postulated to be universal (as with the operation of response to the text that makes the subject
3

Communities of Readers
better understand himself or herself thanks to the mediation of interpretation), a history of reading must identify the specific mechanisms that distinguish the various com. munities of readers and traditions of reading. This move supposes the recognition of several sets of contrasts, the first of which is in the realm of reading ability. The essential but oversimplified separation of the literate from the illiterate does not exhaust the full range of differences in the reader's relation to writing. All who can read texts do not read them in the same fashion, and there is an enormous gap between the virtuosi among readers and the least skilled at reading, who have to oralize what they are reading in order to comprehend it and who are at ease only with a limited range of textual or typographical forms. There are equally great differences between the norms and conventions of reading that define, for each community of readers, legitimate uses of the book, ways to read, and the instruments and methods of interpretations. Finally, there are differences between the expectations and interests that various groups of readers invest in the practice of reading. Such expectations and interests, which govern practices, determine the way in which texts can be read and read differently by readers who do not have the same intellectual baggage or the same relationship with the written word. Michel de Certeau gives an illustration of this sort of approach when he discusses the characteristics of mystical reading: 'By "mystical readings" I mean the set of reading procedures advised or practiced in the field of experience of the solitaries or the collectives designated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as "illuminated," "mystic" or "spiritual".' 4 In this minor, marginal, and dispersed community that was the mystical milieu, reading was regulated by norms and habits that 4

Communities of Readers
invested the book with original functions: it replaced the institution of the church, held to be insufficient; it made discourse possible (the discourse of prayer, of communication with God, of the conversar); it indicated the practices by which spiritual experience could be constructed. The mystical relationship with the book can also be understood as a trajectory in which several 'moments' of reading succeed one another: the installation of an alterity that provides a basis for the subjective quest, the unfolding of a sense of joy, a physical reaction to the 'manducation' of the text that leaves its mark on the body, and, at the end of the process, cessation of reading, abandonment of the book, and absolute detachment. One of the first tasks of a history of reading that hopes to understand the varieties of the paradigmatic figure of the reader as poacher is thus to ascertain the networks of reading practices and the rules for reading proper to the various communities of readers - spiritual, intellectual, professional, and so forth. 5 But to read is always to read something. Naturally, if it is to exist the history of reading must be radically distinguished from a history of what is read: 'The reader emerges from the history of the book, in which he has long been merged, indistinct.... The reader was taken to be the effect of the book. Today he becomes detached fron1 those books whose mere shadow he was supposed to be. And now that shadow is unshackled, it takes on relief and acquires an independence.' 6 That founding independence is not an arbitrary liberty. It is limited by the codes and the conventions that regulate the practices of a membership community. It is .also limited by the discursive ·and material forms of the texts read. 'New readers make new texts and their new meanings are a function of their new forms.' 7 D. F. McKenzie 5

Communities

perspicaciously notes here the dual set of variations variations in the readers' resources and in textual and formal mechanisms - that any history that takes on the task of restoring the fluid and plural signification of texts must take into account. One can profit from McKenzie's dictum in several ways: by noting the major oppositions that distinguish the various modes of reading from one another; by specifying the practices most popular among readers; by focusing attention on the publishing formulas that offer old texts to new readers of a humbler sort and in greater number. This perspective reflects a dual dissatisfaction with the history of the book in France in the last twenty or thirty years, where the historians' chief concern has been to measure the unequal presence of the book in the various groups that made up the society of the ancien regime. This led to the construction (incidentally, quite necessarily so) of indicators to reveal cultural gaps at a given place and time: among such indicators are the percentage of probate inventories mentioning ownership of books, the classification of book collections according to the number of works they included, and thematic description of private libraries according to the place that the various bibliographical categories occupy in them. In this perspective, giving an account of the reading matter of the French between the sixteenth and the eighteenth century was above all a question of constructing data sets, establishing quantitative thresholds, and noting the cultural equivalents of social differences. These procedures were adopted collectively (by the author of the present work among others), and they permitted the accumulation of a body of knowledge without which further investigation would have been inconceivable. They raise problems, however. First, such procedures

6

G,ommunities of Readers
rest on a narrowly sociographic conception implicitly postulating that cultural cleavages are necessarily organized according to pre-existent social divisions. I think we need to reject this dependence that relates gaps in cultural practices to a priori social oppositions, whether on the n1acroscopic scale of contrasts between dominant and dominated or between the elites and the people or on the scale of smaller differentiations, as for exarnple among social groups in a hierarchy of conditions, professions, or levels of wealth. Cultural divisions are not obligatorily organized in accordance with the one grid of social divisions that supposedly commands the unequal presence of objects or differences in behaviour patterns. We must turn the perspective around and begin by designating the social areas in which each corpus of texts and each genre of printed matter circulates. Beginning with objects, in this fashion, rather than with classes or groups leads to considering that the French style of sociocultural history has too long continued to exist on the basis of a mutilated conception of the social. By privileging only socioprofessional classification it has forgotten that other ·and equally social principles of differentiation might explain cultural divisions even more pertinently. The same is true of genderbased and generationally based distinctions, of religious affiliations, of communitarian solidarities, of educative or corporative traditions, and more. Furthermore, the history of the book in its social and quantitative definition atten1pted to characterize cultural configurations on the basis of the categories of texts that were supposed to be specific to those configurations. This operation was doubly reductive. First, it equated the identification of differences with mere inequalities in distribution; second, it ignored the process by which a text takes on meaning for those who read it. Several shifts
7

Communities of Readers
of emphasis could be proposed to correct these postulates. The first situates the recognition of the differences most deeply rooted in society in differing uses of shared materials. In the societies of the ancien regime the same texts were appropriated by 'popular' readers and other readers more than has been thought. Either readers of more humble social condition were put in possession of books that were not specifically designed for them (as was the case of Menocchio, the Friuli miller, Jamerey Duval, the shepherd from Lorraine, or Menetra, the Paris glazier), 8 or else inventive and canny bookseller-printers made available to a very large clientele texts that formerly had circulated only in the narrow world of wealth and letters (which was the case with the pliegos sueltos of Castile and the Catalan plecs, English chapbooks or the publishing formula known in France under the generic title of the Bibliotheque bleue). What is essential is thus to understand how the same texts can be differently apprehended, manipulated, and comprehended. A second shift of emphasis reconstructs the networks of practices that organized historically and socially differentiated modes of access of texts. Reading is not uniquely an abstract operation of the intellect: it brings the body into play, it is inscribed in a space and a relationship with oneself or with others. This is why special attention should be paid to ways of reading that have disappeared in our contemporary world. One of these is reading aloud in its dual function of communicating the written word to those who are unable to decipher it themselves but also of cementing the interlocking forms of sociability that are emblematic of private life in the intimacy of the family circle, in worldly conviviality, and in literary circles and spheres of scholarly sociability. A history of reading must not limit itself to the genealogy of our own contemporary manner of reading, in silence and using only our eyes; it
8

Communities of Readers
must also (and perhaps above all) take on the task of retracing forgotten gestures and habits that have not existed for some time. The challenge matters because it reveals not only the distant foreignness of practices that were common long ago but also the specific structure of texts composed for uses that are not the uses of today's readers of those same texts. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the reading style implicit in a text, literary or not, was still often an oralization of the text, and the 'reader' was an implicit auditor of a read discourse. The work, which was addressed to the ear as much as to the eye, plays with forms and procedures that subject writing to demands more appropriate to oral 'performance'. Many examples of this sort of continuing link between the text and the human voice can be found, from the motifs in Don Quixote to the structure of texts adapted for the Bibliotheque bleue. 9 'Whatever they may do, authors do not write books. Books are not written at all. They are manufactured by scribes and other artisans, by mechanics and other engineers, and by printing presses and other machines.' 10 This remark can serve to introduce the third shift in emphasis that I would like to suggest. Contrary to representation elaborated by literature itself and taken up by the most quantitative form of history of the book, which state that the text exists in and of itself, separate from anything material, we need to remember that there is no text apart from the physical support that offers it for reading (or hearing), hence there is no comprehension of any written piece that does not at least in part depend upon the forms in which it reaches its reader. This means that we need to make a distinction between two sets of mechanisms, the ones that are part of the strategies of writing and the author's intentions, and the ones that result from publishing decisions or the constraints of the print shop. 9

True, authors do not write books: they write texts that become written objects, which may be hand-written, engraved, or printed (and, today, electronically reproduced and transmitted). The space between text and object, which is precisely the space in which meaning is constructed, has too often been forgotten, not only by the traditional sort of literary history that thinks of the work as an abstract text whose typographic forms are without importance, but also by the 'aesthetic of reception' that, in spite of its desire to historicize the readers' experience, postulates a pure and unmediated relationship between the 'signals' emitted by the text (which play with accepted literary conventions) and the 'horizon of expectation' of the public to which those signals are addressed. In this perspective the 'effect produced' in no way depends upon the material forms that operate as a vehicle for the text. 11 Still, those forms also fully contribute to fashioning the reader's expectations and to calling for a new public or novel uses. Thus we have been brought back to the triangle that was our point of departure, the relationship set up among the text, the book, and the reader. The variations in that relationship describe several simple figures for the connection between 'readable space' (espace lisible) and 'effectuation', to use Michel de Certeau's terms. The first variation considers a stable, literal text that is available for reading in printed forms that change. In his study of the innovations introduced into editions of William Congreve's plays at the beginning of the eighteenth century, D. F. McKenzie has shown how apparently insignificant formal changes (moving from a quarto to an octavo edition, numbering scenes, the presence or absence of a decorative element printed between one scene and the next, recalling the names of characters present at the 10

Communities

of Readers

beginning of each scene, marginal indications of the name of the character speaking, mention of exits and entrances} had an important effect on the status of the works. A new readability was created by a forn1at that was easier to manipulate and by a page layout that reproduced within the book something of the n1ovement of the staging, thus breaking with time-honoured conventions that required plays to be printed with no restitution of their theatrical character. This was thus a new manner of reading the same text, but it also provided a new horizon of reception because the mechanisms used in the octavo edition of 1710, borrowed from devices used for printed editions of French plays, gave a new legitimacy to Congreve's plays, henceforth 'classics' and part of the literary canon, and induced their author to make changes here and there to refine the style of his works and make thetn conform better to their new 'typographic' dignity. 12 Variations in the most purely formal aspects of a text's presentation can thus modify ·both its register of reference and its mode of interpretation. The same is true, on a greater scale, of the greatest change in the way texts were cast into print between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries, 'the definitive triumph of white over black' 13 - that is, the introduction of breathing space on to the page by the use of more paragraphs to break up an uninterrupted continuous text and by paragraph indentations that make the order of discourse immediately visib]e. The new publishers suggested a new reading of the same texts or the same genres, a reading that fragtnented the text into separate units and echoed the intellectual or discursive articulation of the argument in the visual articulation of the page. Chopping up the text in this manner could have farreaching implications where Scripture was concerned.
11

John Locke was troubled by the new custom of dividing the text of the Bible into chapter and verse. For him it risked obliterating the powerful coherence of the Word of God. Locke says, speaking of the Epistles of Paul, 'Not only the Common People take the Verses usually for distinct Aphorisms, but even Men of more advanc'd Knowledge in reading them, lose very much of the strength and force of the Coherence and the Light that depends on it.' The effects of breaking up Scripture in this manner were disastrous: it authorized every religious sect or party to found its legitimacy on the scriptural passages that seemed to support its views: If a Bible was printed as it should be, and as the several Parts of it were writ, in continued Discourses where the Argument is continued, I doubt not that the several Parties would complain of it, as an Innovation, and a dangerous Change in the publishing of those holy Books.... He [the member of a particular church) need but be furnished with Verses of Sacred Scriptures, containing Words and Expressions that are but flexible . . . and his System that has appropriated them to the Orthodoxie of his Church, makes them immediately strong and irrefragable Arguments for his Opinion. This is the Benefit of loose Sentences, and Scripture crumbled into Verses, which quickly tum into independent Aphorisms. 14 A second figure pertains when a text is transferred from one form of publishing to another, dictating both a transformation of the text and the constitution of a new public. This is quite obviously the case with the corpus of titles that made up the catalogue of the Bibliotheque bleue. If that series has long claimed the attention of French historians it is because it has seemed to furnish direct access to the 'popular culture' of the ancien regime,

12

Communities of Readers
which has been supposed to have been expressed and nourished by works such as these and distributed en masse among the humbler sort of readers. 15 This was not really the case, and for three main reasons. First, it is clear that the works that made up the French stock of the pedlar's book trade had never been written for that purpose. The Bibliotheque bleue was a publishing formula that dipped into the repertory of already published texts and picked out the ones that seemed most likely to meet the expectations of the broad public it sought to reach. Thus we need to take two precautions: not to take texts in the familiar blue format as 'popular' in and of themselves because they belonged to all the genres of learned literature; to keep in mind that such texts usually had an earlier publishing existence and often a long publishing history before they entered the repertory of books for a wide audience. A study of the works in the 'popular' catalogue has shown that techniques of the most formal and material kind can by themselves inscribe indications of cultural differentiation in published works. In fact, the basic specificity of the Bibliotheque bleue resided in editorial changes made in the texts in order to make them readable by the wide clientele that the publishers were aiming at. The vast labour of adaptation- shortening texts, simplifying them, cutting them up, providing illustrations- was commanded by how the bookseller-publishers who specialized in that market envisioned their customers' abilities and expectations. Thus the very structure of their books was governed by the way that book publishers thought that their target clientele read. That reading style was always thought to demand such visible signals as anticipatory headings, recapitulative summaries, or woodcuts that functioned as reading

13

Communities of Readers
protocols much like the mansions in the system of the arts of memory- a style of reading at ease only with brief and self-enclosed sequences set off from one another and readers content with a minimal level of coherence. It was certainly not the manner of reading typical of the lettered elites of the age, even if certain notables deigned to buy the blue-covered books. Works printed for a broad public counted on their readers' previous knowledge. By the recurrence of extremely coded forms, by the repetition of motifs that return from one work to another, and by reuse of the same illustrations, an acquaintance with texts that the reader had already encountered was mobilized into serving for the comprehension of unfamiliar reading matter. In this way the 'blue' catalogue organized a manner of reading that was more recognition than true discovery. It is thus specific formal aspects of the 'blue' editions and the modifications that they imposed on the works they made use of that reveal their 'popular' character. In proposing this re-evaluation of the Bibliotheque bleue my intention has not been uniquely to reach a better understanding of the most powerful of the instruments of acculturation to the written culture in ancien regime France. 16 It has also been to say that identification of sociocultural differentiations and a study of formal and material mechanisms, far from being mutually exclusive, are necessarily connected. This is so not only because forms are modelled on the expectations and abilities attributed to the public at which they are aimed, but above all because works and objects produce their social area of reception much more than they are produced by crystallized and previously existent divisions. Lawrence W. Levine has proposed a fine demonstration of this. 17 Analyzing the way in which Shakespeare's plays were 14

Communities of Readers
produced in America (mixed in with other genres such as melodran1a, farce, circus turns, dance, and so forth}, Levine shows how this type of representation created a numerous public that was 'popular' in that it was not limited to the lettered elite and that it participated actively in the performance by its emotions and reactions. In the late nineteenth century the strict division that was established among genres, styles, and places split up this 'general' public, reserving Shakespeare to the 'legitimate' theatre and a smaller audience and sending off the rest of the audience to more 'popular' entertainments. Changes in the actual form in which Shakespeare's plays were presented (but the same was true of symphonic music, the opera, and works of art} played a large part in the constitution of a 'cultural bifurcation', and a time of mixed and shared offerings was succeeded by a time in which a process of cultural distinction produced a social separation. The traditional mechanisms for representing the Shakespearian repertory in America were thus of the same order as the 'typographic' transformations that the publishers of the Bibliotheque bleue performed on the works they chose: in both cases, the intent was to inscribe the text into a cultural matrix that was not the one that its original creators had in mind, and by that means to permit 'readings', comprehensions, and uses that might have been disqualified by other intellectual habits. These two examples lead us to consider cultural gaps as the effect of dynamic processes rather than as an expression of static and fixed divisions. On the one hand, a transformation in the forms and the mechanisms through which a text is proposed authorized new appropriations, thus it created new publics and new uses. On the other hand, the fact that an entire society shared the same objects invited a search for new differences to mark
15

Communities

of Readers

distances that had been maintained. The trajectory of print works in ancien regime France stands as witness to this. It was as if the distinctions among ways to read were progressively reinforced as printed matter became less rare, less often confiscated, and a more ordinary commodity. Whereas the mere possession of a book had long signified cultural difference, with the conquests of printing, reading postures and typographical objects were gradually invested with that function. Henceforth readers of distinction and handsome books stood opposed to hastily printed works and their awkward decipherers. As we have seen, however, both groups often read the same texts, whose plural and contradictory significations were invented along with their varying uses. This means that the question becomes one of selection: why did certain texts lend themselves better than others to durable and multiple reuse? 18 Or at least why did book publishers consider them capable of reaching very different publics? The response lies in the subtle relationships that were set up between the structure of the works, which were not all open to reappropriation in the same degree, and the multiple determinations, both institutional and formal, that regulated their possible 'application' (in the hermeneutic sense of the term) to very different historical situations. There is a third figure of the relationship among text, .print, and reading when a text that is stable in its letter and fixed in its form is apprehended by new readers who read it in other ways than did previous readers. 'A book changes by the fact that it does not change when the world changes' 19 or, to change the statement to fit the scope of the present work, ' ... when its mode of reading changes'. This remark is enough to justify a projected history of reading practices that would seek to identify the 16

Communities

major oppositions that can give different meanings to a same text. It is perhaps time to question three of these fundamental cleavages, which are held to be certain. First, the opposition between a reading in which comprehension depends upon oralization, either out loud or mumbled, and another, possibly visual, reading. 20 Even though his chronology is open to question, let me recall Michel de Certeau's remark about the reader's freedom and silent reading: Reading has become, over the past three centuries, a visual poem. It is no longer accompanied, as it used to be, by the murmur of a vocal articulation or by the movement of a muscular manducation. To read without uttering the words aloud or at least mumbling them is a 'modem' experience, unknown for millennia. In earlier times, the reader interiorized the text; he made his voice the body of the other; he was its actor. Today, the text no longer imposes its own rhythm on the subject, it no longer manifests itself through the reader's voice. This withdrawal ofthe body, which is the condition of autonomy, is a distancing of the text. It is the reader's habeas corpus. 21 The second accepted cleavage falls between an 'intensive', reverential, and respectful reading of a small number of books that relies on hearing and memory and an 'extensive' reading that consumes many texts, passes nonchalantly from one text to the next, and holds less sacred what is read. 22 The third cleavage is between a private, cloistered, solitary reading, considered to be one of the essential elements for constituting a sphere of private life, and the collective reading - both disciplined and rebellious - of communitarian spaces. 23 These widely accepted oppositions suggest a chronology that sees as major mutations the gradual advances in
17

Communities

silent reading in the Middle Ages and the entry into the world of extensive reading in the late eighteenth century. They prompt several reflections, however: some of these would reduce the simplicity of the dichotomies present in these contrasts by shifting attention to gradations within each opposed entity, by introducing nuances into the criteria that too abruptly differentiate styles of reading, and by reversing the automatic association of the collective with the popular and the elite with the private. 24 Others suggest a connection atnong three sets of transformations whose effects have often been imperfectly untangled: 'revolutions' that have taken place in techniques for the reproduction of texts (first among them, a shift from 'scribal culture' to 'print culture'); changes in the very forms of the book (the change from the roll or volumen to the book in signatures or codex during the early centuries of the Christian era was the most fundamental of these but other and less sweeping changes modified the visual aspect of the printed page between the sixteenth and eighteenth century); 25 wide-scale change in reading skills and in modes of reading. These different evolutions did not develop at the same pace and were not punctuated by the same breaking-points. ~rhe most interesting question posed to and by the history of reading today is certainly that of the ways in which these three sets of mutations - technological, formal, and cultural - related to one another. The response to that question obviously depends upon a re-evaluation of the trajectories and divisions characteristic of the society of the ancien regime. More than is admitted, they were organized on the basis of the presence of written matter. That presence has long been gauged uniquely in one of two ways: either by signature counts aimed at establishing literacy rates, hence at evaluating

18

Communities of Readers
variations in the ability to read according to ages, sites, sexes, and conditions; or by scrutiny of library inventories drawn up by notaries or booksellers in an attempt to measure the circulation of books and reading traditions. In societies of the ancien regime as in our own, however, access to print cannot be reduced to book ownership alone: every book that is read is not necessarily a book that is personally owned, and all printed matter kept in the home is not obligatorily a book. Moreover, written materials lay at the very heart of the culture of the illiterate and were present in rituals, public spaces, and the work place. 26 Thanks to speech, which deciphered writing, and to the image, which mirrored it, written matter was made accessible even to those who were incapable of reading it or who, left to their own devices, would have had only a rudimentary comprehension of it. Literacy rates do not give an accurate measure of familiarity with the written word - all the more so since in older societies, where learning to read and learning to write were two separate and successive operations, there were many individuals (women in particular) who left school knowing how to read at least a little but not how to write. 27 Similarly, individual possession of a book is an inadequate indication of how often those who were too poor to have any sort of 'library' in their homes might have handled a printed text. Even if it is totally impossible to establish the number of readers who were not even able to sign their names or the number of readers who owned no books (or at least no books worthy of being appraised by the notary who drew up the inventory) but who could read signs and posters, news-sheets and chapbooks, we none the less have to postulate that they were many in order to comprehend the impact of printed written matter on the older forms of
19

a culture that was still largely oral, action-based, and iconographic. The two modes of expression and communication dovetailed in many ways. To take first the ways in which writing and gesture mixed: not only was the written word at the centre of urban festivities such as religious ceremonies, but a number of texts were intended to cancel themselves out as discourse and to produce practical results in behaviour recognized as being in conformity with social or religious norms. This was the case with the civility books, which aimed at teaching the rules of polite social intercourse or Christian propriety. 28 There was also a dovetailing of speech and writing, which operated in two ways: first, the texts destined by their author and (more often) by their publisher to the most popular public often contained formulas or themes that came directly from the culture of the tale and oral recitation. The writing style of certain occasionnels (newssheets) that imitate the speech patterns of tale-tellers and the variants introduced in the 'blue' editions of fairy tales (which all originally came from literary collections) are good examples of an orality coming to the surface in printed matter. 29 Second, as we have seen, a number of 'readers' apprehended texts only thanks to the mediation of a voice reading them. Comprehending the specificity of this relationship with the written word thus supposes that not all reading must necessarily be individual, solitary, and silent, but, quite to the contrary, that one must acknowledge the importance and the diversity of reading aloud, a practice that has largely been lost. This acknowledgement, which points to the strength of the penetration of print culture in ancien regime societies, leads to several others. First, it can account for the importance given to written matter and to the objects that bore writing by all the authorities who intended to

20

regulate behaviour and fashion minds. Hence the pedagogical, acculturating, and disciplining role attributed to the texts put into circulation for a wide readership; hence also the controls exercised over printed matter, which was subjected to censorship to eliminate anything that might threaten religious or moral order. Michel de Certeau invited us to recognize both the efficacy of these constraints, which were more and more binding as the individual was more strongly connected with the institution that decreed them ('The creativity of the reader grows as the institution that controlled it declines'), 30 and the various modalities for bridling the reader's interpretation, which ranged from exterior censorship - administrative, judiciary, inquisitorial, scholastic, and so forth- to constraining mechanisms within the book itself. Texts from bygone years construct representations of the possible uses of the written word and the various ways of handling printed matter in which we can recognize the cleavages that those who produced books held to be decisive. Such perceptions are essential to the extent that they underlie strategies for writing and for publishing that were governed by the supposed skills and expectations of the various target publics. Hence those perceptions acquire an efficacy traces of which can be found in explicit protocols for reading, in the forms given to typographical objects, or in the transformations that changed a text when it was given to new readers in a new publishing formula. It is thus on the basis of the various representations of reading and of the dichotomies constructed in the early modern age (between the reading of a text and the reading of an image; between literate reading and hesitant reading; between intimate reading and communitarian reading) that we must attempt to understand the uses of and adjustments made in these print pieces humbler

than the book but just as omnipresent and which ranged from images volantes (illustrated broadsheets) and placards (topical illustrations and commentary) to the occasionnels and the little blue books (which often had illustrations). Representations of older forms of reading and of the differences among them, as they are revealed on the practical level by the process of casting a text into printed form, or representations of their normative purposes in literary, pictorial, and autobiographical works constitute the basic data for an archaeology of reading practices. None the less, although they express the contrasts that were uppermost in the minds of their contemporaries, they mask other and less clearly perceived cleavages. For example, it is certain that many practices reversed the very terms of the opposition that has so often been depicted between solitary reading in the privacy of a bourgeois or aristocratic setting and reading in common among popular listeners. In reality, reading aloud while others listened long remained one of the practices that cemented elite sociability; conversely, printed matter penetrated to the very heart of the humble home, where it imbued modest objects that were by no means always books with traces of an important moment in private life, a memory of an emotion, or a sign of identity. Contrary to the classical image of 'the people', a product of the early modem age,, 'the people' is not always to be sought in the plural, but rather in the secret solitude of the humble practices of individuals who cut out the images of the occasion nels, who coloured printed engravings, and who read the chapbooks for simple enjoyment. The approach proposed in the present work (and put into effect in a few others) is tied to a particular terrain (France between the sixteenth and the eighteenth century) and to a specific problem (the effects of the penetration

of printed written matter on the culture of the greater number). It attempts to put into operation two propositions of Michel de Certeau. The first recalls, against all reductive attempts to deny the creative and inventive force of practice, that reading is never totally constraint and that it cannot be deduced from the texts it makes use of. The second stresses that readers' tactics, insinuated in the lieu propre (place of their own) produced by the strategies of writing, obey rules, follow logical systems, and imitate models. This reflects the paradox underlying any history of reading, which is that it must postulate the liberty of a practice that it can only grasp, tnassively, in its determinations. Constructing communities of readers as 'interpretive communities' (Stanley Fish's expression), discerning how material forms affect meaning, localizing social difference in practices more than in statistical distributions - these are the routes laid out for anyone who wishes to understand as a historian the 'silent production' that is 'the activity of reading'. 31

D. F. McKenzie has stressed the fundamental kinship between bibliography {in its classic definition of a study of the physical aspects of the book) and all forms of structuralist criticism, noting, 'The congruence of bibliography and criticism lay precisely in their shared view of the self-sufficient nature of the work of art or text.... In neither case were precedent or subsequent processes thought to be essential to critical or bibliographical practice. ' 1 For both the New Criticism and analytical bibliography, the production of meaning relied on the automatic and impersonal operation of a system of signs either the system instituting the language of the text or the one organizing the form of the printed object. Consequently, both approaches refused to consider that the manner in which a work is read, received, and interpreted has any importance for establishing its meaning, and both proclaimed 'the death of the author' (as Barthes titled his famous essay) and stripped authorial intention of any special pertinence. In this perspective, dominant in the English-speaking world (Great Britain, the United States, Australia, New Zealand), the history of the book

Figures of the Author
was thus a history with neither readers nor authors. What it saw as essential was the process of the fabrication of the book, a process apprehended from traces left in the object itself and explained by editorial decisions, printshop practices, and the customs of the print trade. Paradoxically (if one remembers that the first goal of a study of the material aspects of the book has traditionally been to establish and publish correct and authentic texts), 2 bibliographic tradition has contributed greatly to the effacement of the author that was characteristic of the hegemony of semiotics. In France, where the history of the book was more immediately cultural and social, the perspective could have been (perhaps should have been) different, but the historians' primary interests bore it elsewhere. 3 Scholars were more interested in ascertaining wealth, alliances, and hierarchies in the milieu of those who manufactured and sold books: merchant-booksellers, printers, compositors and pressmen, type founders, engravers, bookbinders, and others. Historians attempted to reconstruct the circulation of books, inequalities in book ownership among the various groups in society, and the impact of the book on mentalities. This approach privileged a quantitative treatment of massive data sets, relying on such materials as lists of books contained in probate inventories, catalogues printed for public auction sales of libraries, or, when historians had the good luck to come across them in the archives, booksellers' account books. It focused, if not on reading practices, at least on the sociology of readers. The author was forgotten in French history of the book as in the Anglo-Saxon bibliographic tradition - somewhat paradoxically when we recall Lucien Febvre's and Henri-Jean Martin's original programme 'to examine the influence and the practical significance of the printed book during the first 300 years of its existence'. 4 In the tradition of the social history 26

Figures of the Author
of print as it has developed in France, books have readers but they do not have authors- or, more precisely, authors do not enter into that history's domain of competence: they are wholly the province of literary history and its time-honoured genres- biography, the study of a school or a current, or the description of an intellectual milieu. Whether the history of the book neglects the author or leaves him or her to others, it has been practised as if its techniques and discoveries were irrelevant to the history of those who produced texts, or as if that history had no importance for the comprehension of works. In recent years, however, we have seen the return of the author. Literary criticism has distanced itself from points of view exclusively focused on the internal operation of the system of signs that constitutes a text, and it has attempted to set works back within their history. This move has taken various forms. The 'aesthetic of reception' aimed at describing the dialogue between an individual work and its readers' 'horizon of expectations', defined as the set of conventions and references shared by the work's public or publics. This approach, far from taking the meaning of the text as stable, univocal, and universal, thus comprehended it as historically constructed and as produced in the dialogue that exists between the propositions contained in the work (which are in part controlled by the author's intentions) and the readers' responses. 5 The New Historicism is more interested in situating the literary work in relation to 'ordinary' texts (of a practical, juridical, political, or religious nature) that constitute the raw materials on which writing operates and that make its intelligibility possible. 6 With the sociology of cultural production, based on concepts forged by Pierre Bourdieu, analysis shifts to the laws of operation and the hierarchies proper to a gtven field (literary, arttstlc,

27

Figures of the Author
academic, religious, political, and so forth), to the structural relationships situating the various positions defined within a field, to the individual or collective strategies that those positions command, and to the transfer into the works themselves (in terms of genre, form, theme, and style) of the social conditions of their production.7 Finally, the bibliography defined as a 'sociology of texts' proposed by D. F. McKenzie focuses on the way in which the physical forms through which texts are transmitted to their readers (or their auditors) affect the process of the construction of meaning. Understanding the reasons and the effects of such physical devices (for the printed book) as format, page layout, the way in which the text is broken up, the conventions governing its typographical presentation, and so forth, necessarily refers back to the control that the authors but sometimes the publishers exercised over the forms charged with expressing intention, orienting reception, and constraining interpretation. 8 In spite of striking differences, even divergences among them, a common characteristic of all these approaches is that they reconnect the text with its author; the work with the intentions or the positions of its producer. This is of course not a restoration of the superb and solitary romantic figure of the sovereign author whose primary or final intention contains the meaning of the work and whose biography commands its writing with transparent immediacy. As he returns in literary criticism or literary sociology the author is both dependent and constrained. He is dependent in that he is not the unique master of the meaning of his text, and his intentions, which provided the impulse to produce the text, are not necessarily imposed either on those who tum his text into a book (booksellerpublishers or print workers) or on those who appropriate it by reading it. He is constrained in that he undergoes the

28

Figures of the Author
multiple determinations that organize the social space of literary production and that, in a more general sense, determine the categories and the experiences that are the very matrices of writing. The multifaceted return of the author in critical problematics takes us back to the question that Michel Foucault posed in a famous essay that has become an obligatory reference: What is an author?9 In this essay Foucault distinguished between the 'sociohistorical analysis of the author's persona' and the more fundamental problem of the construction of an 'author-function' as a prime means of classifying discourses. Foucault states that, far from being universal or relevant to all texts in all ages, the attribution of a proper name to a work is a way of discriminating . between texts. It is valid only for certain classes of texts ('The author-function is characteristic of the mode of existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a society'); it supposes a state of law that recognizes the author's penal responsibility and the concept of literary property ('The author-function is linked to the juridical and institutional system that encompasses, determines, and articulates the universe of discourses'). The author-function stands at some distance from the empirical evidence according to which every text has a redactor; it is the result of 'specific and complex operations' that put the unity, the coherence, and the inscription into historical context of a work (or a set of works) into relation with the identity of a constructed subject. This operation relies on a dual process of selection. First, the texts assignable to the author-function must be separated from the many texts that an individual may produce ('How can one define a work amid the millions of traces left by someone after his death?'). Second, one must pick from among the innumerable events that constitute a biography

29

Figures

and must retain the facts pertinent to a definition of the author's position. Although it is not his prime objective, Foucault sketches a history of the emergence of (and variations on) the attribution of texts by identification with a proper name the name of the author - endowed with a quite specific function. In the original version of 'Qu'est-ce qu'un auteur?' Foucault outlined three chronological stages. The first, and the only one that commentators remark on with any frequency, is the time when 'a system of ownership for texts came into being ... strict rules concerning author's rights, author-publisher relations, rights of reproduction, and related matters were enacted - at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century'. This strong connection between the individuality of the author and the inscription of the activity of writing and publishing within the regime of private property is not, however, the founding principle of the author-function. The function is older and rooted in other determinations:
We should note that, historically, this type of ownership has always been subsequent to what one might call penal appropriation. Texts, books, and discourses really began to have authors (other than mythical, 'sacralized' and 'sacralizing' figures) to the extent that authors became subject to punishment, that is, to the extent that discourses could be transgressive.

Foucault proposes no date for that 'penal appropriation' linking the author-function to the exercise of power by an authority with the right to censor, judge, and punish rather than, as formerly, to the juridical conventions regulating relations between private individuals. A third
30

Figures of the Author
remark none the less hints that, thus defined, the authorfunction predates the modern world. To illustrate the point that 'the author-function does not affect all discourses in a universal and constant way', Foucault evokes the radical reversal that, according to him, 'occurred in the seventeenth century or eighteenth century', when rules for the attribution of texts belonging to 'scientific' and 'literary' discourse were exchanged. After that watershed moment, the authority of scientific statements was founded on 'their membership in a systematic ensemble' of pre-established truths rather than on reference to particular authors; 'literary discourse', on the other hand, 'came to be accepted only when endowed with the author-function'. Formerly the reverse had been true: There was a time when the texts that we today call 'literary' (narratives, stories, epics, tragedies, comedies) were accepted, put into circulation, and valorized without any question about the identity of their author; their anonymity caused no difficulties since their ancientness, whether real or imagined, was regarded as a sufficient guarantee of their status. On the other hand, those texts that we now would call scientific - those dealing with cosmology and the heavens, medicine and illnesses, natural sciences and geography - were accepted in the Middle Ages, and accepted as 'true,' only when marked with the name of their author. It is not my intention to debate the validity of the change that Foucault notes in this passage but rather to note that he recognizes that, for certain classes of texts, reference to the author was functional as early as the Middle Ages. A hasty reading must not lead us to reduce Foucault's thought to oversimplified formulas: in no way does he

31

Figures of the Author
postulate an exclusive and determinant connection between literary property and the author-function; between 'the system of property that characterizes our society' and a system for the attribution of texts founded on the category of the subject. By moving the figure of the author back in time and by articulating it with mechanisms for controlling the circulation of texts or for lending them authority, Foucault's essay invites us to a retrospective investigation that gives the history of the conditions of the production, dissemination, and appropriation of texts particular pertinence. Such a history would lead - and in fact has led in several recent studies - to a reconsideration of the context in which the concept of literary property first appeared. 10 The first major revision suggested that the affirmation of literary ownership, far from arising from a particular application of a modern individual property law, derived directly from the book trade's defence of permissions to print - authorizations that guaranteed exclusive rights to a work to the bookseller who had obtained title to it. In England and in France, it was really the monarchy's attempts to limit the privileges, which traditionally granted perpetual rights, that led the bookseller-publishers to link the irrevocability of their rights to recognition of the author's ownership of his or her work. The strategy of the London booksellers' opposition to the Statute of 1709, which set a fourteen-year limit on copyrights (prolonged for another fourteen years if the author was still alive), has points of similarity with Diderot's strategy in the 1760s when he defended Paris booksellers who were concerned that perpetual renewals of their privileges n1ight be done away with. The London booksellers attempted to safeguard the perpetuity of their copyrights by treating the property rights of the author who ceded a manuscript to
32

Figures of the Author
them as a common law right. Diderot attempted to profit from the opportunity offered him to demonstrate authors' full literary property by presenting the privilege as a perpetual right of ownership rather than as a favour accorded by the sovereign. Diderot states: 'I repeat: the author is master of his work or no one in society is master of his wealth. The bookseller possesses it as it was possessed by the author.' Thus for Diderot the writer's ownership founded the legitimacy of the privilege; conversely, it was the imprescriptibility of the privilege that manifested the author's rights. 11 Thus what Mark Rose has to say about England might well be applied to France: 'It might be said that the London booksellers invented the modem proprietary author, constructing him as a weapon in their struggle with the booksellers of the provinces' 12 - those same provincial booksellers whose activities depended almost entirely on reprints made possible by the suppression of perpetual permissions accorded to the powerful booksellers of the two capitals. When the governing powers recognized the authors' rights over their works, they did so in the ancient logic of the privilege. This was true in the case with the Statute of 1709, which attempted to break the monopoly of the London booksellers by giving authors the right to demand a copyright themselves. It was also the case in France with the decree of the king's council of 1777 that stated that the book trade privilege was a 'grace founded in justice' (not founded by 'a rightful proprietorship') and that the permiss'ions that the author had obtained in his own name were perpetual and patrimonial: 'He will enjoy his privilege, for himself and his heirs, in perpetuity.' In neither land did authors have an absolute right to their property - in England because of the limited duration of the copyright, even when granted to the author; in France

33

Figures of the Author
because if the author ceded a manuscript to a bookseller, the latter's privilege (the minimum duration of which was ten years) was valid only 'during the life of the authors, in the event that they survive the expiration of the privileges'. In neither system of law was literary ownership equated with the ownership of real property, which was inalienable and freely transmissible. Thus literary ownership had to be justified, whether it was considered absolute by booksellers who used the concept in defence of perpetual privileges and copyrights or whether it was considered limited by the state, which recognized it in order to allow the constitution of a public domain in printing. The 1777 law states, for example, that 'all booksellers and printers may obtain, after the expiration of the privilege for a work and the death of its author, a permission to print an edition without the granting of this permission to one or several persons preventing anyone else from obtaining a similar permission'. In the debates and lawsuits involving book trade permissions in England, France and Germany, two systems for legitimizing the author's rights were used, either simultaneously or concurrently. The first, explicitly or implicitly founded on a reference to the theory of natural law as formulated by Locke, considered the author's ownership to be the fruit of individual labour. This theme appeared in 1725 in a memoir that the booksellers' and printers' guild in Paris, eager to defend privileges even at that early date, commissioned from the jurist Louis d'Hericourt. The memoir states that the work produced by an author is 'the fruit of a labour that is personal to him, which he must have the liberty to dispose of at will'. 13 The same thought runs through the arguments of the London booksellers: 'Labour gives a man a natural right of property in that which he produces: literary
34

Figures of the Author
compositions are the effect of labour; authors. have therefore a natural right of property in their works. ' 14 In France, the decree of the king's council of August 1777 implicitly linked the perpetuity of the permissions accorded to authors and the specificity of their 'labour': His Majesty has recognized that the book trade privilege is a grace founded in justice that has as its object, if it is accorded to the author, to reward his labour; if it is obtained by a bookseller, to assure him the reimbursement of his advance payments and compensation for his expenses, so that this difference in the reasons determining a privilege will produce [a difference) in its duration. Hence the 'more extended grace' that was accorded to authors. Whether they were considered to reflect full proprietorship or compensation, the author's rights over his work found basic justification in the assimilation of writing to labour. The need for a second system of legititnation arose out of objections raised to the very notion of a private appropriation of ideas. In England the adversaries of perpetual copyright held that literary works should be treated in the same way as 'mechanical' inventions. Such critics argued that both were produced by assembling elements available to everyone and should therefore be subjected to similar legislation, hence copyrights should be limited to fourteen years just as patents for the exclusive exploitation of technological inventions were: 'A mechanic Invention, and a literary Composition, exactly agree in Point of Similarity; the one therefore is no more entitled to be the object of Common Law Property than the other.' 15 In France, as Carla Hesse has shown, men such as Condorcet or Sieyes held unlimited literary property to be unjust because ideas

35

Figures of the Author
belonged to everyone, and held it contrary to the progress of Enlightenment because it instituted one person's monopoly over a body of knowledge that should be for the common good. Thus, they argued, literary property should not be absolute but rather the public interest dictated that it should be severely limited. 16 To parry arguments of this sort the champions of authors' exclusive and perpetual rights shifted the basic criterion of those rights. They argued that although ideas could be held in common and shared widely, the same was not true of the form in which the irreducible singularity of style and sentiment was expressed. The legitimation of literary property was thus based on a new aesthetic perception designating the work as an original creation recognizable by the specificity of its expression. This concept combining a unique form, the author's genius, and the inalienability of the author's ownership was argued during the conflicts engendered in England by the Statute of 1709, in particular by William Blackstone in Tonson v. Collins in 1760. It found its most radical formulations in open polemics in Germany between 1773 and 1794 in which (as was also true in France and England) discussion of book trade privileges was linked to a debate about the very nature of literary creation. The controversy, to which such writers as Zacharias Becker, Kant, Fichte, and Herder contributed, resulted in a new definition of the work, now no longer characterized by the ideas that it embodied (since ideas cannot be the object of individual appropriation) but by its form - that is, by the particular way in which an author produces, assembles, expresses, and presents concepts. 17 The text, which results from an organic process comparable to Nature's creations and is invested with an aesthetic of originality, transcends the circumstantial materiality of the book - a transcendence
36

Figures of the Author
that distinguishes it from a technological invention 18 and it acquires an identity immediately referable to the subjectivity of its author rather than to divine presence, tradition, or genre. This theory of the work prefigures the main traits of the author-function as Foucault presents it, where the author is 'the principle of a certain unity of writing' different from all others and 'a particular source of expression' manifested in all the creations attributed to that author. Thus in the latter half of the eighteenth century a somewhat paradoxical connection was made between a desired professionalization of literary activity (which should provide remuneration in order for writers to live from their writings) and the authors' representation of themselves in an ideology of literature founded on the radical autonomy of the work of art and the disinterestedness of the creative act. 19 On the one hand, the poetic or philosophic work became a negotiable commodity endowed with a valeur commer,ante, as Diderot put it, hence could be the object of . a contract and evaluated in monetary terms. On the other hand, the work was held to result from a free and inspired activity motivated by its internal necessities alone. When authors shifted from the patronage system (where retribution for their writing usually preceded the act of writing in the form of a sinecure or followed it in the form of gratifications) to operate in the market, where immediate and monetary profit was expected from the sale of a tnanuscript to a bookseller (or, for a dramatist, from a percentage of the proceeds of performances of his plays), this shift was accompanied by an apparent! y contradictory change in the ideology of writing, henceforth defined by the urgency and absolute freedom of creative power. 20 The connection established between inspiration and merchandise doubly reversed the traditional view of
37

Figures

literary activity. The notion that 'Glory is the Reward of Science, and those who deserve it, scorn all meaner Views ' 21 prompted the objection that it was simple justice for the labour of writing to involve pecuniary profit. Formerly, dependency was the norm for authors with neither a public office nor independent means; now that dependency stood in stark contrast to the consubstantial independence of all creative invention. 22 A radical reversal different from the one discussed by Foucault thus seems to have occurred during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Before, the author's subjection to obligations created by client relations and patronage ties was accompanied by a radical incommensurability between literary works and economic transactions. After the mid-century the situation was reversed when a possible and necessary monetary appreciation of literary compositions, remunerated as labour and subject to the laws of the market, was founded on an ideology of creative and disinterested genius that guaranteed the originality of the work. It is tempting to draw a close connection between the modem definition of the author and the resources (or the demands} inherent in the publication of printed texts. In his study of Samuel Johnson, whose life Boswell's biography made 'the model of the poetic role in the age of print', Alvin Kernan stresses the relationship between the constitution of a market for works - a market that only printing could make possible - and the affirmation of the author. In the 'new print-based, author-centered literary system' in late eighteenth-century England the author - at least the successful author - could enjoy a financial independence that freed him from the obligations of patronage and enabled him to acknowledge his published works. This new model broke with the classic figure of the gentleman writer or the gentletnan amateur formerly

38

Figures of the Author
accepted even by writers who were by no means of aristocratic birth. In the traditional definition, the author lived not by the pen but from investments and landholdings or public office; he scorned print and expressed an aristocratic 'antipathy to a medium that perverted the primary courtly literary values of privacy and rarity'; he preferred the chosen public of his peers, manuscript circulation for his works, and concealment of his name in an anonymous work. When recourse to printing became unavoidable the effacement of the author that was typical of the 'courtly tradition of anonymity' took several forms. The author might choose to leave his name off the title page (as with Swift). He might use the fictional device of a manuscript found by chance: Thomas Gray wrote, speaking of his Elegy in a Country Churchyard, 'If [the printer] would add a Line or two to say it came into his Hands by Accident, I should like it better.' Or he might create an apocryphal author: Thomas Rowley, a monk from Bristol, was the declared author of poetns actually written by Thomas Chatterton, and James MacPherson invented a Celtic bard, Ossian, presenting himself as merely the translator of the works he had in fact written. These values and practices characteristic of the 'literary ancien regime' had been undermined, however, by 'a new world of letters based on the realities of print technology and its market economics'. The new economics of writing supposed the full visibility of the author, the original creator of a work from which he could legitimately expect to profit. 23 Definitions in French-language dictionaries of the latter seventeenth century seem to confirm the association between the author and print publication. In 1690 Furetiere's Dictionnaire universe! gave seven meanings for the word auteur, and the one concerning La litterature came
39

Figures of the Author
only in sixth place, after definitions in the realms of philosophy and religion ('one who has created or produced something. Said par excellence of the first Cause which is God'), technical ('said in particular of those who are the first Inventors of something'), practical ('said also of those who are the cause of something'), political ('said also of Leaders of a party, an opinion, a conspiracy, or a rumour going about'), and genealogical ('the author of the race of a house, of a family'). It precedes the juridical definition: 'In terms of the Palace [of Justice], one calls Authors Those who have acquired the right to possess some inheritance by sale, exchange, donation, or other contract.' The word is thus not immediately invested with a literary meaning, its first uses situating it in the register of natural creation, material invention, and a chain of connected actions. When it arrives at the literary meaning, the Dictionnaire universe/ specifies, 'Author, in literature, is said of all those who have brought some book into the light. Now one says it only of those who have had a book or books printed.' The dictionary adds as an example of the use of the term, 'That man finally has risen to be an Author, has been printed.' The term 'author' presupposed printed circulation of works and, in return, recourse to the press distinguished the 'author' from the 'writer', whom Furetiere defines without reference to printing: 'Escrivain, is said also of those who have composed Books, Works.' Ten years before Furetiere, the Dictionnaire Fran{ais of Richelet had already established a necessary connection between the author and printing in its second definition of the word (after the prime meaning of 'the first who has invented something, who has said something, who is cause of something that has been done'). The entry reads: 'He who has composed some printed book', and it is

40

Figures of the Author
followed by illustrative examples: 'Ablancour, Pascal, Voiture, and Vaugelas are excellent French Authors. Queen Marguerite, the daughter of Henry Ill, was an author. ' 24 In his series of examples Furetiere also takes care to mention the presence of women among authors: 'One says also of a woman that she has risen [s'est erigee] as an Author when she has made some book or theatrical work. ' 25 For these two dictionaries of the late seventeenth century, the term 'author' is not to be applied to anyone who writes a work; the term distinguishes among all 'writers' only those who have cared to have their compositions published. Writing was not enough if one wanted to s'eriger en auteur; one's work also had to circulate in public by means of print. We find this relationship expressed in the late seventeenth century, but was it even older? One answer to the question comes from the first two catalogues of Frenchlanguage authors published in France, the Premier Volume de Ia Bibliotheque du Sieur de La Croix du Maine (1584) and La Bibliotheque d'Antoine du Verdier, seigneur de Vauprivas (1585). 26 The long subtitle of the Bibliotheque of La Croix du Maine is clearly organized on the basis of the category of the author: 'Which is a general catalogue of all sorts of authors who have written in French for five hundred years and more until this day: with a Discourse on the lives of the most illustrious and renowned among the three thousand who are included in this work, together with a relation of their compositions both printed and other.' The author-function already has its basic characteristics here. For one thing, La Croix du Maine makes authorship the first criterion of classification of works that have no other distribution than names in alphabetical order - or rather, in the medieval manner, of their author's first names, since the Bibliotheque runs from 'Abel 41

Figures of the Author
Foulon' to 'Yves Le Fortier', with a table of contents to aid retrieval of the authors on the basis of their last names. Further, in proposing 'lives' of the authors (which, incidentally, do not figure in volume one of the Bibliotheque, the only volume to have been published), La Croix du Maine sets up the writer's biography as the fundamental reference for writing. This primacy given to the author, defined as a real individual whose life can be related, is confirmed by Antoine Du Verdier, whose Bibliotheque 'containing the catalogue of all those who have written or translated in French and other Dialects of this Realm' excludes fictive authors: 'I have not wanted to put in it the Almanacs of various sorts that have been made annually under supposed names. Given even that correctors in printing establishments made them, for the most part, in the name of persons who never were.' The two Bibliotheques of La Croix du Maine and Du Verdier attest that the deployment of the author-function was not necessarily connected either with print publication or with the independence of the writer. Both of them, unlike Richelet and Furetiere in their definitions of a century later, consider that the manuscript makes the author just as much as the printed book. In fact, the two compilations announce in their titles that they will mention, for all authors, 'their compositions both printed and other' (La Croix du Maine) or 'all of their works printed and not printed' (Du Verdier). La Croix du Maine, justifying the usefulness of his catalogue as a means for preventing usurpers from publishing under their own name works remaining in manuscript at their true author's death, specifies, 'inasmuch as I have spoken of both printed works and those that are not yet in the light [en lumiere]'. At the end of the sixteenth century in France, if the category of the author constituted the basic
42

Figures of the Author
principle for classifying discourse, it did not obligatorily presuppose their mise en lumiere, that is, their existence in print. The author-function had no trouble harmonizing with the dependency instituted by patronage. In a dedication addressed to the king, La Croix du Maine mentions his two reasons for publishing the Premier Volume of his Bibliotheque. The first was to show the superiority of the Kingdom of France with its three thousand authors who had written in the vernacular, whereas the authors who had written or translated into Italian nun1bered no more than three hundred. 27 The second was 'to have the friendship of so many learned men who are living today of whom the greater part are employed in the service of your Majesty' (emphasis mine). The detail attests that the construction of the author-function was quite conceivable within the modalities that characterized the 'literary ancien regime'. Far from being contradictory, the patronage connection and the affirmation of the author together define the regime of assignation of texts. La Croix du Maine clearly expressed this when in 1579 he wrote of his Grande Bibliotheque Fran{oise, volume five of which, published five years later, was a simple Epitome. La Grande Bibliotheque Fran,oise, which was never printed, was not only to contain 'the catalogue of the works or writings of every author' but also indicated for all works 'by whom they were printed, in what format or size, in what years, how many sheets they contain, and especially the names of the men or women to whom they were dedicated, without omitting all their entire qualities' (emphasis mine). As on a title page, every work was thus referred to the names of three persons, the author, the dedicatee, and the bookseller or printer-publisher, reinforced by his mark. 28
43

Figures of the Author
The title page of the editio princeps of Don Quixote in 1605 illustrates this well. 29 At the top is the title in capital letters: EL INGENIOSO / HIDALGO DON QUI/ XOTE DE LA MANCHA. Underneath this, in italics, comes the essential assignment of the text, 'Compuesto por Miguel de Cervantes / Saavedra'. (This information is repeated in the preliminary materials along with the tasa indicating the price at which the book can be sold 'doscientos y noventa maravedfs y medio' - and the licencia, which accords the author a printing privilege for ten years.) Under the author's name, in roman letters, is the mention of the dedicatee with his titles in full: 'DIRIGIDO AL DUQUE DE BEIAR, / Marques de Gibraleon, Conde de Benalca~ar, y Baiia-fres, Vizconde de Ia Puebla de Alcozer, Senor de I las villas de Capilla, Curiel, y / Burguillos.' The upper third of the title page is thus given over to the fundamental relationship that dominated literary activity until the mid eighteenth century: the connecting of an author (already constituted as such) to a protector from whom he expected support and gratifications. The printer's mark, framed by the two elements of the date, 'Ano' and '1605', occupies the greater part of the remaining space. At the bottom there are three lines of text: 'CON PRIVILEGIO, / EN MADRID, Por Juan de Ia Cuesta. I Vendese en casa de Francisco de Robles, librero del Rey nro senor.' These provide the proper indications to satisfy the requirements of the book trade: mention of the privilege, the mark of royal authority, the place of publication and the name of the printer and, at the very bottom under a solid horizontal line, the address at which an eventual buyer could buy the work. The very construction of the visual space of the title page expresses several things that are less, contradictory

44

Figures of the Author
and earlier in date than is sometimes thought. The first is an affirmation of the author's literary paternity, recognized by the king who accords Cervantes the licencia y facultad to print or have printed a work 'that cost him great labour and is most useful and profitable'. The same paternity is displayed with irony by Cervantes in his prologue: 'Pero yo, que, aunque parezco padre, soy padrastro de don Quijote, no quiero irme con Ia corriente de uso, ni suplicarte casi con las lagrimas en los ojos, como otros hacen, lector carfsimo, que perdones o disimules las faltas que en este mi hijo vieres' (But I, though in appearance Don Quixote's father, am really his stepfather, and so will not drift with the current of custom, nor implore you, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do, dearest reader, to ~ardon or ignore the faults you see in this child of mine). 0 The play on the words padre and padrastro is a way to prefigure the fiction introduced in chapter 9, the first chapter in the 'Segunda Parte' of the 1605 Quixote, in which the narrative offered the reader is in fact a translation into Castilian done 'en poco mas de mes y medio' {in little more than six weeks) by a Morisco from Toledo of a manuscript in Arabic, the Historia de don

Quijote de Ia Mancha, escrita por Cide Hamete Benengeli, historiador ardbigo. 31 Neither the theme of the text encountered by chance (in this case, found amid the 'cartapacios y papeles viejos' - 'parchments and old papers' -sold by a lad to a silk merchant) nor that of the pre-existent work of which the published book simply offers a copy or a translation is used here to disguise the real author. The 'authors' of the novel multiply: there is the 'I' of the prologue who announces that the work is his; then there is the author of the eight first chapters who upsets the '1-reader' inscribed in the text when he suddenly interrupts his narration ('This caused me great annoyance'); 45

Figures of the Author
there is also the author of the Arabic manuscript; finally, there is the Morisco author of the translation that is the text read by the '1-reader' and by the reader of the novel. What this break-up of the author does, however, is to manifest the figure of the author in its primordial function of guaranteeing the unity and the coherence of the discourse. The title page of Don Quixote is equally unambiguous in its presentations of patronage (with the dedication to the duke of Bejar) and the market (with the mention of the printer, Juan de Ia Cuesta, to whom Cervantes had ceded the licenda y facultad to print his book accorded to the author by a royal cedula dated 26 September 1604). The author's desire to participate in market logic and to have control over the sale of his works to a bookseller or a printer who will publish them is totally compatible with an acceptance of or a search for patronage. One example of this (among others) in Elizabethan England is the case of Ben ] onson. ] onson affirmed (and exercised) the author's right to sell his works directly to a publisher, contradicting a long-standing custom that granted theatrical companies an exclusive right to have copied or printed the manuscripts of the plays they put on. Thus he seized control of his own texts in view of publication (as for the edition of the Workes of Benjamin Jonson published by William Stansby in 1616). Ben ] onson also counts among the first English authors who dedicated their published plays to aristocratic patrons: The Masque of Queenes was dedicated to Prince Henry in 1609, Catiline to the Count of Pembroke in 1611, and The Alchemist to Mary Wroth in 1612. Patronage and the market were thus not mutually exclusive, and all authors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries faced the same need as Ben Jonson: to adapt 'the modern

46

Figures

technology of dissemination to an archaic patronage economy'. 32 Contracts between authors and booksellers confirm this dovetailing of the rules of commerce and the need for protection. In the thirty or so contracts that Annie Parent-Charron has found for Paris in the years 1535-60 the commonest case has the bookseller taking responsibility for all the printing costs and for obtaining the privilege and the author receiving as rentuneration free copies of the book ranging in number frotn twenty-five copies for the translation of Livy's Decades by Jean de Amelin published by Guillaume Cavellat (in a contract dated 6 August 1658) to one hundred copies for the Epithome de Ia vraye astrologie et de Ia reprovee of David Finarensis printed by Etienne Groulleau (contract dated 22 August 1547). A monetary remuneration added to the free copies from the bookseller appears only in two situations, when the author obtained the privilege and paid the chancery fees, and when the contract covers a translation, especially in the years 1550-60 for the Castilian chivalric romances that were all the rage. Even in that case, the consignment of copies that could be offered to the king or to grandees (actual or potential patrons) remained the most important element. Proof of this is a clause in the contract dated 19 November 1540 between Nicolas de Herberay and the Paris booksellers Jean Longis and Vicent Sertenas for Herberay's translation of the second, third, and fourth parts of Amadis de Gaule. For his labours and for the privilege that Herberay himself had obtained, he received not only 80 ecus d'or soleil and twelve copies of each book en blanc en volume de Jeuille (in unbound sheets) but also an exclusive right to distribute the book for a limited time: the contract states that booksellers 'can distribute or sell any of the

47

Figures of the Author
said three volumes only after they have first been presented by the said Herberay to the King our Lord, on pain of all expenses and damages and interests, which he promises to present six weeks after the said fourth volume will have been delivered to him printed in sheets as stated' - a delay that would give the author time to have the presentation copies properly bound. 33 The traditional system of patronage, far from being dismantled by the diffusion of the printed book, adapted to the new technique for the reproduction of texts and to the market logic that it set up. This is true for the Renaissance, and it was probably still partially true in the eighteenth century, at the time of the first 'professionalization' of authors who were eager and at times capable of living {not necessarily well) by their pens. As Robert Damton has shown in his analysis of the list of writers kept under surveillance by Inspector of Police d'Hemery between 1748 and 17 53 and the survey of gens de lettres published in La France litteraire in 1784, the two ancient models for the author's condition remained dominant: the writer either enjoyed an economic independence assured by birth or profession or lived on gratifications and sinecures procured from patronage. 34 The new phenomenon of a social status founded solely on the remuneration of writing emerged only with difficulty within the mental framework of the ancien regime, a situation expressed by Voltaire in his diatribes against 'the miserable species that writes for a living'. Freedom (of ideas or of commerce) seemed in no way contradictory to the protection of authority, beginning with the protection of the king, dispenser of positions and favours. Since the emergence of the author-function is less directly connected to the definition of the concept of literary property than might be thought, must it then be

48

Figures of the Author
attached to 'penal appropriation' of discourses? To the writer's judicial responsibility? Or, as Foucault writes, to 'the danger of writing' when writing had become subject to criminal prosecution?35 Answering this question and exploring the complex and multiple relations between state and church censorship and the construction of the figure of the author is far beyond the scope of the present study. Let me cite one example, though. In France after 1544 catalogues of the books that had been censored by the Faculty of Theology of Paris began to be published. In all editions of this catalogue {1544, 1545, 1547, 1551, 1556) titles are arranged in the same manner, 'secundum ordinem alphabeticum juxta authorurn cognomina'. The Sorbonne's Index used the category of the author as its fundamental principle for designating books in its lists of Latin works and French works. The 1544 catalogue begins with the rubrics 'Ex libris Andreae Althameri', 'Ex libris Martini Buceri', and so forth, maintaining its reference to the author even for anonymous books, which are enumerated under the titles 'Catalogus librorum quorum incerti sunt authores' {for Latin titles) and 'Catalogus librorum gallicorum ab incertis authoribus' (for French works). 36 In parallel fashion, the author's responsibility was introduced into royal legislation for controlling the printing, distribution, and sale of books. The edict of Chateaubriant of 27 June 1551, which marked the apogee of the collaboration between the king, the Parlement, and the Sorbonne regarding censorship, states in its article 8:
It is forbidden to all printers to perform the exercise and status of impression except in good cities and orderly establishments accustomed to do this, not in secret places. And it must be under a master printer whose name,

49

Figures

domicile, and mark are put in the books thus printed by them [with] the time of the said impression and the name of the author (emphasis mine]. The which master printer will answer to faults and errors that either by him or under his name and by his order will have been made and committed. The author-function was thus constituted as an essential weapon in the battle against the diffusion of texts suspected of heterodoxy. In the repression of suspect books, however, the responsibility of the author of a censured book does not seem to have been considered any greater than that of the printer who published it, the bookseller or the pedlar who sold it, or the reader who possessed it. All could be led to the stake if they were convicted of having proffered or diffused heretical opinions. What is more, the acts of conviction often mix accusations concerning the printing and ,sale of censured books and accusations concerning the opinions - published or unpublished- of the perpetrator. This is what happened to Antoine Augereau, a type engraver who had become a printer, who was strangled and his body burned in the Place Maubert on 24 December 1534. The details of his sentence are not known but the chroniclers of the time explain the event by insisting on two points. First, they stress Augereau's printing activities (he was supposedly sentenced for having been an 'ally of bill-posters [of placards against the mass posted up during the night of 17-18 October 1534] and for having printed false books' as well as for having 'printed and sold books of Luther's'). Second, they insist on his heterodox opinions. One chronicle brands Augereau as 'Lutheran', and the judgement of the Parlement refusing him the

50

Figures of the Author
privilege of being tried before an ecclesiastical court (he was a cleric) specifies that he was 'charged with having said and proffered several erroneous, blasphemous, and scandalous pro.Positions [the orig.inal. has grepositi~ns] against holy doctnne and the Catholic fatth'. 3 Thus tt was as an 'author' of heretical opinions as much as it was for his activities as a printer that Antoine Augereau was burned at the stake. Similarly, the accusations levelled against Etienne Dolet, a hutnanist who had become a printer, by the Sorbonne in 1543 mention not only the books that Dolet had printed or that merely were found in his house but also those that he had written or for which he had written a preface. 38 After the respite granted him by his abjuration on 13 November 1543, it was on the same charges {for having printed and sold prohibited books, having written unorthodox prefaces to several books) that Dolet was strangled and his body burned on 3 August on the Place Maubert, along with the censured books. 39 In its connection with church or state censorship as in its association with literary property, the author-function is fully inscribed within the culture of print. In both cases it appears to derive from fundamental transformations brought by printing: it was printing that extended, hence that made more dangerous, the circulation of texts that defied authority, and printing created a market that presupposed the establishment of rules and conventions among all who profited from it, economically or symbolically, the writer, the bookseller-publisher, and the printer. But was this really the case? Perhaps not, if we acknowledge that the essential traits in the book that manifest the assignation of the text to a particular individual designated as its author do not make their first appearance with printed works but were already typical of the manuscript book at the end of its unchallenged reign. 51

Figures of the Author
The most spectacular of those traits is the physical representation of the author in his book. The portrait of the author, which makes the assignation of the text to a single 'I' immediately visible, is frequent in printed books of the sixteenth century. 40 Whether or not the image endows the author (or the translator) with real or symbolic attributes of his (or her) art, whether presented in heroic classical style or 'from life', in natural appearance, the function of the author's portrait is to reinforce the notion that the writing is the expression of an individuality that gives authenticity to the work. However, representations of the author - and often of the author shown in the act of writing - appear in miniatures decorating manuscripts in the vernacular of the late fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries. This is true of works of Christine de Pisan, Jean Froissart, and Rene d'Anjou, and of Petrarch and Boccaccio. Portraits of the sort were novelties in two ways. First, at a time when the French words escrire and escripvain took on their modern meanings to indicate not only the copying but also the composition of texts, such portraits show an autograph writing that no longer presupposes dictation to a secretary. Second, they transfer to contemporary authors who wrote in the vulgar tongue the theme, frequent since the early fourteenth century in Latin texts, of writing as individual invention and original creation. The new image broke with time-honoured conventions in representations of the process of writing, both the convention that equated writing with listening to a dictated text and copying it (for example in the traditional iconography of the Evangelists and the Fathers of the church figured as scribes of the Divine Word) and the convention that thought of writing as a simple continuation of an existing work (as in the

case of the scholastic practice of the gloss and the commentary). 41 That first and manifest form of the presence of the author in the book was accompanied by another less visible to the reader, which is the control exercised by the writer over the form of publication of the text. The edition of Congreve's Works published by Jacob Tonson in London in 1710 is emblematic of the author's intervention in the process of publishing his works. As we have seen in chapter 1, on the occasion of this octavo edition of his plays, which until then had been printed separately in a quarto format, Congreve gave new form to his texts, dividing them into scenes where they had been lacking and providing more stage directions with his dialogue. These innovations were reflected in the way in which the plays were printed by means of numbers for scenes, print ornaments placed between one scene and the next, a mention of the characters present given at the beginning of each scene, indications in the margin of who was speaking, and the notation of exits and entrances. These formal mechanisms, which were borrowed from French published theatrical works, gave a new status to the works, and that fact in tum led Congreve to prune his text of a few details that he considered contrary to the dignity of this new presentation. 42 Contracts between printers and authors are another proof of the control that authors expected to exercise over the publication of their works. If sixteenth-century Paris can serve as an example, an author, as one might expect, had every reason to be demanding when he had a work printed and sold it himself, either directly or through a bookseller. Thus on 11 May 1559 Charles Perier, a merchant-bookseller and printer, promised a representative of the bishop of Laon, Jean Doc,

53

Figures

of the Author

to print and have printed, well and duly, as should be done, six volumes of the Homelies des dimanches et Jestes de /'annee in the same letters and similar characters that the said Perier used formerly for the said Reverend gentleman [an allusion to other books printed by Perier for Jean Doc], and to do so in quarto volumes, and to adjust the annotations in it as they will be delivered to him.

Concern for the form of the book can also be seen when an author gave over his manuscript to a bookseller in exchange for free copies of the work and, at times, monetary remuneration. On 22 August 1547, when he contracted to print the Epithome of David Finarensis, Etienne Groulleau declared that he would respect 'the state in which he [Finarensis] wishes it to be printed, in the French language and with the type used in a piece of printed paper that he left in the hands of the said Finarensis, signed by the subscribed notaries, ne varietur'; on 29 November .1556 Ambroise de La Porte promised to print 'well and duly' a work of Andre Thevet entitled Les singularitez de Ia France antarctique and to 'have engraved figures in such terms as shall be agreed to between the said Thevet, de La Porte, and master Bernard de Poiseulne (the engraver]'; finally, on 3 April 1559 Frederic Morel rece~ved several works composed or translated by Louis Le Roy, 'all to be printed correctly in handsome characters and [on] good paper, in large roman or italic letters'. 43 These agreements, which mention the typeface, the paper, the plates, and at times the format, attest clearly the authors' intention to establish their control over the way their texts were to circulate. This intention was not born with print. In order to prevent his works from being corrupted by a division of labour between author and copyist so strict that he 'would
54

Figures of the Author
no longer be able to recognize the texts he composed', Petrarch proposed another formula that would guarantee the author's domination of the production and transmission of the text. The 'author's book', produced from an autograph copy (not a scribe's copy), designed for limited circulation, and protected from the faulty copying of professional copyists, would manifest the author's intentions as the work had been composed with less risk of betraying those intentions or vitiating them. Controlled and stabilized in this manner, the text was to institute a direct and authentic relation between the author and the reader because, as Armando Petrucci tells us, 'perfect textuality, a direct emanation from the author validated by his autograph writing, was (and forever remained) a guarantee of absolute readability for the reader.' 44 Even though Petrarch's programme and his practice (he copied several of his own works in his own hand) remained out of the mainstream of the economy of production of the manuscript of his tirne, they none the less reflect an early emergence, in the fourteenth century, of one of the major expressions of the author-function, the possibility of deciphering in the forms of a book the intention that lay behind the creation of the text. The more immediate and more material manifestation of the assignation of discourses to an author lies in the unity between a work and an object, between a textual unit and a codicological unit. This was long not true of works in the vulgar tongue. The don1inant form of the manuscript book was, in fact, that of the notarial register or, in Italy, the libro-zibaldone. Such unadorned, small or medium-sized books, written in a cursive hand, were copied by their own readers, who put in them, in no apparent order, texts of quite different sorts in prose and in verse, devotional and technical, documentary and

55

Figures of the Author
poetic. These compilations, produced by lay people unfamiliar with the traditional institutions of manuscript production and for whom the act of copying was a necessary preliminary to reading, characteristically show no sign of the author-function. The unity of such a book comes from the fact that its producer is also its addressee. 45 Even beyond this new public made up by readers who are not professionals of written culture (officials, notaries, secretaries), the form of the compilation, which was shared by a number of genres (exempla, sententiae, proverbs, fables, tales, lyric poetry, and so forth) helped to minimize assigning works to an individual. Thus among the three types of collections of lyric poetry of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries discerned by Jacqueline Cerquiglini, only one (the one in which a poet gathers together his or her works) is fully qualifiable as displaying the author-function. The two other types (a collection of several poets' works in the form of an album and a collection in the form of an anthology) either present the texts anonymously or, when the authors' names are rubricated, construct the book's unity on the basis of the principle of a literary game played within a circle of friends or at a princely court that is a far cry from an individualized work. 46 None the less, even before the age of the printed book (which incidentally prolonged the tradition of composite collections in a number of genres}, the connection between a codicological unit and a textual unit ascribed to an author in his full singularity became true of certain works in the vulgar tongue. This was the case, for example, with Petrarch. A precise study shows how one of his major vernacular works, I trionfi, was transmitted in the manuscript tradition during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. 47 The first thing we note 56

Figures of the Author
is that the manuscripts containing only texts by Petrarch (either only I trionfi or I trionfi along with the Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta and/or other works) account for 62 per cent of the 424 manuscripts surveyed, whereas those in which Petrarch's text figures with the works of other authors represent 37 per cent of total books surveyed. Thus it is clear that during the last centuries . of the hand-copied book, although a strong relationship existed between the book as an object and the author as a guarantee of the book's coherence, there were still signs, even with an author such as Petrarch, of the practice of the collection of works of mixed authorship. The second thing to note is that the author's singularity won out over the singularity of the wo~k. In fact, the manuscripts that include only I trionfi represent 25 per cent of this total corpus, as against 37 per cent for those that combine two or several works by Petrarch (including his letters). The modern notion of 'book', which spontaneously associates an object and a work, although not unknown in the Middle Ages, separated off only slowly from the collection of several texts by a given author. A final remark: between the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries the author-function clearly progresses in the identity of the book. Whereas in the 79 manuscripts in this corpus that come from the first half of the fourteenth century there is a nearly even balance between manuscripts containing only works by Petrarch and others mixing Petrarch's works with those of other authors (53 per cent and 46 per cent), the gap increases later in favour of manuscripts by Petrarch alone (63 per cent against 37 per cent) in the 248 manuscripts of the latter half of the fourteenth century, and 7 4 per cent against 26 per cent in the 78 manuscripts dating from the fifteenth century.

Foucault was right to recognize a presence of the author in the Middle Ages, when texts circulated in manuscript, but his hypothesis that authorship as a function for the classification of discourses was attached to medieval 'scientific' texts while 'literary' works fell under the rule of anonymity seems somewhat more fragile. In reality, a basic distinction must be made between the ancient texts - whatever their genre - that founded their authority on the work's attribution to a name (not only Pliny or Hippocrates, whom Foucault mentions, but also Aristotle and Cicero, St Jerome and St Augustine, Albert the Great and Vincent of Beauvais) and works in the vulgar tongue for which the author-function was constituted around a few great 'literary' figures - in Italy, Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. In this sense, the trajectory of the author can be thought of as a gradual change in the way texts in the vernacular were regarded, attributing to them a principle of designation and election that had long been characteristic only of works that were referred to an ancient auctoritas and that had become part of a corpus of works continually cited and tirelessly commented upon. By the same token, the radical reversal in the seventeenth or eighteenth century between the abandonment of the author-function among scientific texts and the demand for an author-function in poetic and fictional texts becomes somewhat less clear. If by twisting the rule of individual attribution of literary works the various games played with the author's name (dissimulation, disguise, usurpation) in reality confirmed the rule of the individual attribution of literary works, 48 it is less certain that a rule of anonymity commanded the production of scientific statements. For a notable length of time the validation of an experience or the accreditation of a

58

Figures of the Author
proposition presupposed the guarantee provided by a proper name - the proper names of those who, by their position in society, had the power to proclaim the truth. 49 The fact that scholars and practitioners disappeared behind aristocratic authority in no way resulted in the anonymity of a discourse whose authenticity was not exclusively dependent on its compatibility with an already constituted body of knowledge. During the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries a number of scientific texts displayed a characteristic that Foucault (perhaps wrongly) reserved to medieval works alone: later scientific texts were also 'accepted ... and accepted as "true," only when marked with the name of their author' - an 'author', however, who was long understood as someone whose social position could lend 'authority' to intellectual discourse. 'What is an author?' The few reflections presented here are not intended as an answer to the question. All they hope to do is to stress that the history of the book, in all its various dimensions, can have some pertinence to the problem. It would be a mistake to reduce the construction of an author-function, understood as the major criterion for the attribution of texts, to oversimplified or toounivocal formulas. Nor can that construction be pinned down to one determining cause or a unique historical moment. The present text, which examines three sets of mechanisms - juridical, repressive, 50 and material fundamental for the invention of the 'author', simply aims at staking out an area for possible future study. The author-function, inscribed in the books themselves, ordering all attempts to establish textual classifications commanding the rules for the publication of texts, is henceforth at the centre of all questions linking the study of the production, forms, and readers of texts.

These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, although vast, is not infinite): in other words, all that it is given to express, in all languages. Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogue of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of all books in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books. When it was proclaimed that

Libraries without Walls
the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. 1

'When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness.' The dream of a library ( in a variety of configurations) that would bring together all accumulated knowledge and all the books ever written can be found throughout the history of Western civilization. It underlay the constitution of great princely, ecclesiastical, and private 'libraries'; it justified a tenacious search for rare books, lost editions, and texts that had disappeared; it commanded architectural projects to construct edifices · capable of welcoming the world's memory. In 1785 Etienne-Louis Boullee proposed a project for the reconstruction of the Bibliotheque du Roi. 2 The architect's guiding idea was to cover the long ( 100 x 30 metres) interior court between the existing buildings with a barrel vault, thus making a reading room that would be the largest in all Europe. Along the sides of this 'immense basilica' lighted by a skylight at the top of the vault there were to be four stepped tiers lined with bookshelves, the uppermost of which provided a base for a colonnade. The colonnade was to be continued at either end of the room to form something like a 'triumphal arch' with the curve of the vault 'under which two allegorical statues coJld be put'. The works shelved in this reading room were to be placed within easy reach for readers who strolled before them, or they could be obtained by means of a human chain of 'persons placed on various levels and distributed so as to pass the books from hand to hand'. In the perspective view that accompanied the Memoire describing the project and in Boullee's presentation model tiny figures of readers draped in Roman togas are visible

62

Libraries without Walls
(one can count forty-four of them). They are walking among the books accumulated there; they pause, standing, to read a book, or they group around the few tables placed in the hall. The message is clear: a space in the form of a basilica and devoted to reading recuperates a sacred character that ecclesiastical buildings had lost; study is like a voyage among books punctuated by advances and halts, by solitary reading, and by erudite conversation. The acknowledged model for Boullee's representation. of his reading room is Raphael's School of Athens, but there are important difference between the two depictions. In the fresco in the Stanza della Segnatura there are few books, and the few that are shown are in the hands of the person who composed or copied them; in Boullee's drawing the thousands of books of the Bibliotheque du Roi constitute a universal body of knowledge that has been conserved and reduced to a thesaurus. Similarly, in Boullee's vision, the perspective is no longer structured to present an open porch, a human presence, and the power of creative discourse (that of Plato and of Aristotle surrounded by their disciples); rather it converges towards a door that marks the threshold between the profane world of the ignorant and the world of learning's elect and towards an allegorical statue in the classical mode, a symbol of the heritage that must be brought together and mastered before new thoughts are conceivable. Bringing together the entire written patrimony of humanity in one place proves an impossible task, though. When print produced a proliferation of titles and editions, it ruined all hope for an exhaustive collection. Even for those who held that a library must be encyclopedic, selection was an absolute necessity. This was true for Gabriel Naude in his Advis pour dresser une Bibliotheque, written in 1627 and addressed to Henri de Mesmes,

63

Libraries without Walls president at the Parlement de Paris and a great book collector. 3 Against the model of the cabinet curieux or the cabinet choisi reserved to the delectation of their proprietor and gathering together a small number of books distinguished for their rarity or their luxury, N aude pleads for a well-furnished library: 'It is much more useful and necessary to have, for example, a great quantity of books well bound in the ordinary fashion than to fill only some small, pale, gilded, and decorous room or cabinet enriched with all manner of little oddities [mrgnardise], luxuries, and superfluities.' 4 A library is not built to satisfy egotistical enjoyments but because there is 'no more honest and assured means for acquiring a great renown among the peoples than to erect handsome and magnificent Libraries in order then to dedicate and consecrate them to the use of the public'. 5 This noble design had a corollary:
This is why I will always esteem that it is most appropriate to gather to that effect all sorts of Books (subject to the few precautions, however, that I shall state below), since a Library arranged for the use of the public must be universal, and it cannot be so if it does not contain all the principal Authors who have written on the great diversity of particular subjects. 6 Ideally made up of an 'infinity of good, singular, and remarkable' works, the library must none the less limit its ambitions and make choices: Still, in order not to leave this quantity infinite by not defining it, and also in order not to throw the curious out of all hope of being able to accomplish and come to the end of this handsome enterprise, it seems to me that it is appropriate to do as the Physicians do, who order the quantity of drugs according to their quality, and to say

64

Libraries without Walls
that one cannot lack gathering all those (books] that have the qualities and conditions required for being put in a Library. 7 Naude's Advis thus functons to guide the collector as he makes necessary selections and takes the appropriate 'precautions', since Naude indicates the authors and the works absolutely indispensable for his library. The division between the books that one absolutely must possess and those that might (or must) be left aside is only one of the ways to mitigate the problem of the impossibility of a universal library. There were other ways, which the language of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries indicated with the very term defining the place in which the books were kept: bibliotheque. In the entry for that word in Furetiere's Dictionnaire (1690) the first definition is the most traditional meaning: 'Bibliotheque: Apartment or place destined for putting books; gallery, building full of books. Also said in general of the books that are placed in this vessel.' Next comes a second meaning designating a book rather than a place: 'Bibliotheque is also a Collection, a Compilation of several works of the same nature or of Authors who have compiled all that can be [compiled] on the same subject.' In his Advis N aude praises the many merits of the collections that constitute as many 'libraries' in one work: In the first place, they save us the trouble of seeking out an infinite number of highly rare and curious books; secondly, because they leave space for many others and give relief to a Library; thirdly, because they condense for us in one volume and commodiously what we would have to seek with much trouble in several places; and finally,

65

Libraries without Walls
because they bring with them a great saving, being certain that it requires fewer testons [coins worth ten sous] to buy them than it would require ecus if one wanted to have separately all the [works] that they contain. 8 The Latin terms for a collection vary considerably in these titles: thesaurus, corpus, catalogus, Jlores, and so forth. In French the genre was usually qualified as a bibliotheque. Four years after the publication of Furetiere's Dictionnaire, the Dictionnaire of the Academie Fran~aise bore witness to this preference: 'One also calls Bibliotheques Collections and Compilations of works of like nature.' Three examples follow the definition: 'La Bibliotheque des Peres, La Nouvelle Bibliotheque des Peres, La Bibliotheque du Droit Fran,ois.' Eighteenth-century bookseller-publishers published great numbers of these multiple-volume collections gathering together published works in a given genre such as novels, tales, or travel accounts. Not all such collections bore the name bibliotheque. For example, there was the sixteen-volume Histoire generale des voyages of Abbe Prevost covering the years from 17 46 to 17 61, published first in quarto format and later, between 1746 and 1789, in eighty duodecimo volumes; there were two publications put out by Charles Gamier, the Cabinet des fees (1785-9), forty-one volumes in octavo format, and the Voyages imaginaires, songes, visions et romans cabalistiques (1787-9), in thirty-nine octavo sized volumes. Many collections, however, made use of both the formula and the term inaugurated by the Amsterdam periodicals of Jean Le Clerc, the Bibliotheque universelle et historique (1686-93), the Bibliotheque choisie (1703-13), and the Bibliotheque ancienne et moderne: Pour servir de suite aux Bibliotheques universelle et choisie (1714-27}. In all, there were thirty-one

66

Libraries without Walls
periodical publications in the French language, some of which lasted longer than others, that were offered under the title of bibliotheque between 1686 and 1789. 9 The term was used throughout the century, with seventeen titles published before 1750 and fourteen after. Several of these publications were not periodicals, properly speaking, but imposing collections of texts related by their genre or their targeted audience. One such was the Bibliotheque universelle des romans (Paris, 177 5-89, 224 volumes in duodecimo format), which was presented as a 'periodical work in which is given the reasoned analysis of Novels ancient and modern, French or translated into our language', which published extracts and summaries, historical and critical notes, unabridged texts of novels, and tales both ancient and original. 10 Another was the Bibliotheque universelle des dames (Paris, 1785-97, 156 octodecimosized volumes), which had encyclopedic atnbitions, given that it contained travel narratives, novels, and works of history, morality, n1athematics and astronomy, physics and natural history, and all the liberal arts. These imposing 'libraries', along with the encyclopedias and the dictionaries, constituted a major part of the great publishing ventures of the eighteenth century. As Louis-Sebastien Mercier noted, they guaranteed the diffusion of knowledge- or at least of literary pleasure- and they provided a living for a multitude of the people who were scornfully called demi-litterateurs or ecrivailleurs. As Mercier put it:
Panckoucke and Vincent commision [dictionaries] frotn any compiler armed with scribes; volumes are built by the alphabet just as an edifice is constructed in the space of so many months. The [success of the] work is sure thanks to maneuvers. Everything has been put in dictionaries. The

67

Libraries without Walls
scholars complain: they are wrong. Must not sctence descend to all conditions? 11

The 'libraries', which aimed at being exhaustive and universal in any given genre or domain, had a counterpoint in the eighteenth century in a vast number of equally popular small, concise, and easily handled volumes named extraits, esprits, abreges, analyses, and so forth. 12 The smaller, portable anthologies were another form of 'library' produced by the book trade. Even if both genres offered extracts, their intention was not the same. The smaller works aimed at eliminating, selecting, and reducing rather than accumulating a multitude of separate and dispersed works in one collection (periodical or not). If the way in which collections in the form of a bibliotheque were constructed aimed at accomplishing as best one could the impossible task of gathering together for every reader all the books concerning a particular sphere, an appeal to analysis and esprit implied that such a task was useless or harmful, and that the necessary knowledge, available in a small number of works, needed to be concentrated or distilled like a chemical substance. In that belief they agreed with the utopias of the century that rejected the encyclopedic libraries as over-encumbered and superfluous and permitted only a very few books in their ideal library. In his utopia {more accurately, his uchronia) of 1771, L'An 2440, Louis-Sebastien Mercier pays a visit to the library of the king and finds it to be son1ewhat singular: 'In place of those four galleries of immense length, which contained many thousands of volumes, I could find only one small cabinet, in which were several books that seemed to me far from voluminous.' Intrigued, Mercier asks the librarian what has happened, and the librarian
68

Libraries without Walls
answers that before burning all the books judged to be 'either frivolous or useless or dangerous', the enlightened men of the twenty-fifth century saved the essential, which took up little room:
As we are neither unjust nor like the Saracens, who heated their baths with masterworks, we made a choice: wise men extracted the .substance from a thousand in-folio volumes, all of which they transferred into a small duodecimo-sized volume, somewhat in the same way that the skilful chemists who extract the virtue from plants concentrate it in a flask and throw out the vulgar liquors. We have abridged what seemed of most importance; the best have been reprinted; and all the whole corrected according to the true principles of morality. Our compilers are estimable people and dear to the nation; they ·had taste, and as they were in a creative frame of mind, they were able to choose what was excellent and reject what was not. 13

The tension between comprehensiveness and essence thus ordered the complex and contradictory relations between the library in its usual spatial and architectural sense and print genres (only some of which were called bibliotheques) - relationships that assigned to the 'library' as a book, be it one volume or one of a series, the functions of accumulation or of selection attributed to the place. 14 But a library was not only a place or a collection. Furetiere's Dictionnaire proposes a third definition of the term (not found in the more concise entry of the Dictionnaire of the Academie): 'One also calls Bibliotheque the books that contain the Catalogues of the books in the Bibliotheques. Gesner, Possevin, Photius, have made Bibliotheques. . . . Father Labbe, a Jesuit, has made the Bibliotheque des Bibliotheques in an octavo-sized book that 69

Libraries without Walls
contains only the catalogue of the names of those who have written Bibliotheques. ' 15 For anyone who might wish to design an open and universal library, the possession of such catalogues was a necessity. The sum of their titles defined an ideal library freed from the constraints imposed by any one actual collection and overflowing the limits inherent in anthologies and compilations by the immaterial construction of a sort of library of all libraries in which nothing (or almost nothing) was lacking. N aude tells his interlocutor that the accumulation and copying of catalogues of libraries is obligatory: 'One must not omit nor neglect to have transcribed all the Catalogues, not only of the great and renowned Libraries, ancient or modem, public or private, in the possession of our compatriots or of foreigners, but also the Studies and Cabinets that for not being known or frequented remain buried in a perpetual silence.' Naude gives as one of his reasons for this requirement: 'It is to do pleasure and service to a friend, when one cannot furnish him with the book he lacks, to show and designate to him the place where he truly can find a copy of it, as one can easily do by means of these Catalogues.' 16 Thanks to the circulation of the catalogues, the closed world of individual libraries could be transformed into an infinite universe of books noted, reviewed, visited, consulted and, eventually, borrowed. Furetiere's definition slips from catalogues of particular holdings towards another sort of work. A 'library' is not only the inventory of the books assembled in a specific place; it can be an inventory of all the books ever written on a given subject or by all the authors of a given nation. Thus Furetiere notes: 'In France, there is not yet a general Bibliotheque of all the Authors. There are particular ones by the Sieur La Croix du Maine Manceau and Anthoine 70

Libraries without Walls
Du Verdier. Spain has one by Nicolas Anthonio. There is also a Bibliotheque d'Espagne of Peregrinus, and the Bibliotheque des Escrivains Espagnols by Andre Schot in 1608.' 17 Thus the genre that the Dictionnaire evokes and designates with the term bibliotheque is defined according to two criteria: it lists authors; it respects the national framework (France, Spain). At the end of the seventeenth century such 'libraries' already had a long history. 18 Three such works had appeared before 1550, the Cathalogus illustrium virorum Germaniae suis ingeniis et lucubrationibus omnifariam exornantium of Johann Tritheim (Mainz, 1495), the Bibliotheca Universalis, sive Catalogus omnium scriptorum locupletissimus, in tribus linguis, Latina, Graeca, et Hebraica of Conrad Gesner (Zurich, 1545), and the Illustrium Maioris Britanniae Scriptorum of John Bale (Ipswich, 1548). These three works have several traits in common: they are written in Latin, they list for the most part ancient authors, and they privilege works written in the classical languages. Beyond these similarities, their choices varied. First, as to the framework chosen: a national territory (Germania for Tritheim and Great Britain for Bale, who restricts the scope of his work in its full title: Illustrium Maioris Britanniae Scriptorum, Hoc Est Angliae, Cambriae, ac Scotiae Summarium); the whole of humanity for Gesner. Next, as to the name of the work: Tritheim and Bale (in a new edition of his work in 1557) use the tern1 catalogus, but Gesner innovates, launching a new usage of bibliotheca that detaches the word from its material definition and invests the library without walls proposed in his book with universality. Finally, the three works differ in their organization: Tritheim and Bale chose a chronological structure (the latter specifying in quasdam centurias divisum cum diversitate doctrinarum atque; annorum recta supputatione 71

Libraries without Walls per omnes aetates a Iapheto sanctissimi Noah filio, ad annum domini M.D. XLVIII), providing an alphabetical index to make the work easier to consult. Once again Gesner stands alone, opting for alphabetical order but in the medieval style (unlike Tritheim and Bale) and classifying his authors by their baptismal names - that is, their first names. The declared universality of his Bibliotheca presupposes an exhaustive survey that retains ancients and contemporaries, printed texts and manuscript texts, learned authors and less learned authors. The long title justifies the dual usefulness of the book - Opus novum, et non Bibliothecis tantum publicis privatisque instituendis necessarium, sed studiosis omnibus cuiuscunque artis aut scientiae ad studia me/ius formanda utilissimum - after having declared its content - Catalogus omnium scriptorum locupletissimus, in tribus Unguis, Latina, Graeca, et Hebraica: extantium et non extantium, veterum et recentiorum in hunc usque diem, doctorum et non doctorum, publicatorum et in Bibliothecis latentium. 19 When Anton Francesco Doni published his Libra ria ... Nella quale so no scritti tutti gl'Au tori vulgari con cento discorsi sopra quelli: Tutte le tradutioni Jatte dell'altre lingue, nella nostra e una tavola genera/mente come si costuma Jra Librari (Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, Venice, 1550), he inaugurated a new mode of presentation in this genre. 20 He innovated in three ways: first, in language, since the Libraria reviewed only authors or translators in the vernacular and is itself written in the vulgar tongue. Next, the intention of the book was new: it contains no inventory of all authors, no collection of judgements; rather, it is primarily designed to provide information on titles available in the vernacular: 'I have made this library only to give knowledge of all the books printed in the vulgar language so that people who like to read in our

72

Libraries without Walls
language may know how many works have been published and what [they are], not to judge which are good and which bad.' The third novelty lay in the work's format. Doni abandons large formats (the quarto of Tritheim and Bale, the in-folio of Gesner) to publish his Libraria in a more manageable duodecimo format that the reader who haunted the bookshops in search of the titles that this ideal library (again, without walls) might suggest could easily carry. The small volume of the Libraria published in 1550 had 144 pages, and it mentioned 159 authors, arranged in alphabetical order by their first names (from Acarisio da Cento to Vincenzo Rinchiera). Doni plays learned games with the fourteen letters of the alphabet around which his nomenclature is organized. The initial of the given name of the authors listed in a section was also the initial of the given name of the dedicatee mentioned in a preamble heading the section, as well as the initial of the first word in that brief text (for example, the 'A' section was headed, -'Abate Abati. Assai son 1'opere . . . '). After this list of all the authors who had published in the vulgar tongue, Doni provides three other lists: a typology of vernacular genres ('Humanita I Dialoghi I Comedie I Rime I Lettere I Romanzi I Storie'), an inventory of texts translated from Latin into Italian (arranged according to another system as 'Sacra Scrittura et Spirituali I Historie I Epistole tradotte I Comedie Tragedie I Medicina'), and a 'Tavola Generate di tutti libri volgari' in the form of a bookseller's catlogue but without bibliographic information on specific editions. A year after this first book Doni published La Seconda Libraria listing texts that had not yet been printed. The principle in this work was the same as in the first, with an alphabetical inventory from Acarisio da Cento to Zanobi
73

Libraries without Walls
Fiorentino and with a similar game of correspondences between the letter of the alphabet pertaining to each section and the initial letter of the first word of the brief tales or apologues that opened each section. As Amedeo Quondam has noted, the Libraria of manuscript works 'of Books that the Author has seen in manuscript and which are not yet printed' - is largely fictional, enumerating invented authors and imaginary titles. It provides something like a 'paradoxical and ironic double' to the Libraria that surveys published works. 21 In 1557 Doni joined together his two 'libraries' and published them in an octavo-sized volume printed in Venice by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari. He added to them a third treatise that amplified a text known as early as 1551 on 'the foundation of the Academies, together with their names, their mottoes, their emblems, and the works produced by all the Academicians'. Defined on the 1557 title page as a 'Book necessary and useful to all those who have a need to know the language and who wish to know how to write and to reason about all the authors, books, and works', Doni's two librarie form a complex book. Their bibliographic definition ('they were not only the first Italian national bibliographies; they were also the first bibliographies in a vulgar tongue') 22 fails to do justice to their multiple significance: they proclaim the excellence and the dignity conquered by the vulgar language; they constitute a repertory of contemporary authors; they dismantle, in a parodic key, the recipes for literary invention. Doni's work was known in France, where it gave direct inspiration to the two 'libraries' encountered in chapter 2, the one published in 1584 by Fran~ois de La Croix du Maine and the other published in 1585 by Antoine Du Verdier. 23 These two works share an interest in

74

Libraries without Walls
demonstrating the superiority of the French language over the Italian language by citing the number of authors who wrote in the vernacular, by the fact that French had been used as a literary language longer than Italian, and by the scope of the learning of French expression. This intention is explicit in the Premier volume de Ia Bibliotheque du Sieur de La Croix du Maine. Qui e.st un catalogue general de toutes sortes d' Autheurs, qui ont escrit en Franfois depuis cinq cents ans et plus, jusques a ce jourd'huy {Abel L' Angelier, Paris, 1584). Not only does La Croix du Maine insist in his title on the length of time during which the French language had been used ('for five hundred years and more'), he also com.pares, to the advantage of France, the 'three thousand authors' (in fact 2,031) inventoried in his 'catalogue' and the three hundred (in fact 159) who figured in Doni's Libraria, a fact to which, he adds, 'all can testify with me who have read the book of AntoineFran~ois Dony Florentine, who brought into the light a work of his that he called the Library - that is, the Catalogue of Italian books ancient and modern- that he had printed four years ago, to wit, in the year of salvation 1580' (La Croix du Maine here takes one of the later editions of Doni's work for its first edition, which was published some thirty years earlier). In La Bibliotheque d'Antoine Du Verdier, Seigneur de Vauprivas: Contenant le Catalogue de tous ceux qui ont escrit, ou traduict in Franfois, et autres Dialectes de ce Royaume (Lyons: Barthelemy Honorat, 1585) recognition of the superiority of France does not refer explicitly to Italy: 'In short, excellent Writers and truly good books have so multiplied that it seems now that we have no more need to borrow any knowledge from others, having all sciences among us, perhaps in better form, at least better to our taste and easier for us to learn.' The model from 75

Libraries without Walls
which Du Verdier took inspiration was not Doni but Gesner: 'In our times Conrad Gesner has gathered together all Authors whatsoever in three languages, Hebraic, Greek, and Latin, to his great honour and the common benefit.' It was in reference to that ancient knowledge and that great example ('I have given my book the title of Bibliotheque because Gesner thus entitled his own') that Du Verdier constructed the catalogue by which he intended to prove the excellence of the modems: 'I have worked to do the like for our French people who have written in our language in order to show the world to what extent our country is abundant in good minds.' Unlike La Croix du Maine, Du Verdier feels no need to call on the great antiquity of the use of the French language; he simply surveys modem authors 'from sixty or seventy years past', whom he finds sufficiently numerous and excellent to obviate any need to name older writers, since before that time 'our [authors] were somewhat heavy in their writings.' There are obvious similarities between Doni's Libraria and La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque: both inventory books (both printed and manuscript) written or translated into the vulgar tongue; both offer brief biographies of some of the authors whose works they list (La Croix du Maine says in his subtitle, 'with a Discourse on the lives of the most illustrious and renowned among the three thousand who are included in this work, together with a relation of their compositions both printed and other'); both classify authors in strict alphabetical order by author's given name (from Abel Foulon to Yves Le Fortier for La Croix du Maine). In dedicating his work to the king (Henri III), La Croix du Maine thought it necessary to justify this arrangement that overlooked differences in social condition: 76

Libraries without Walls
There remains one point to note to you, Lord of France, which is that you must not judge it ill if I have put the names of some poeple into an order about which (according to some hasty judgements) you might say that I had erred by doing so, and (that you will acknowledge) that I was not too wrong in this case. As, for example, if you see that I have spoken of the Kings of France, whether of Fran~ois I, Charles IX, or Henri III, would you say that I was mistaken when I happened to place them after their subjects, or else having spoken of the father or the mother when I have put the children first, or disciples before their masters? Certainly I have felt the impropriety of having thus observed an alphabetical or A, B, C order, but I have done so everywhere where it is called for, in order to avoid all calumny and to remain in amity with everyone.

There are none the less fundamental differences between the works of Doni and La Croix du Maine that come from their quite different manner of understanding the library without walls. First, there is a physical and formal difference between the two works: far from being a manageable small-format book in the manner of the Libraria, La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque was a majestic folio volume, a libro da banco, to use Armando Petrucci's terminology, not a libro da bisaccia (saddlebag book) or a libretto da mano (little handbook). 24 The world referred to in La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque is not the book trade and its commerce but the world of the cabinet (book room), of study, and of compilation. In a short piece entitled Desseins, ou Projects du Sieur de La Croix du Maine, presentez au Treschrestien Roy de France et de Pologne Henri III du nom, l'an 1583, au mois de May La Croix du Maine declared that he owns in his library 'eight hundred volumes of Memoirs and diverse Collections, written by my hand and otherwise, and all of my invention or sought
77

Libraries without Walls
by myself, and extracts from all the books that I have read until this day, of which the number is infinite, as can easily be seen by the twenty-five or thirty thousand notebooks and chapters on all sorts of subjects that can fall within man's ken'. Anton Francesco Doni's Libra ria was founded on the practice of literary novelties; La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque was based on the scholastic tradition of commonplace books. A literate man without originality, but not without prolixity since he claims to have composed several hundred works (which he enumerates in a Discours Ju Sieur de La Croix du Maine contenant

sommairement les Noms, Tiltres et Inscriptions de Ia plus grande partie de ses Oeuvres Latines et Fran{oises dated 1579), La
Croix du Maine scrupulously calculates his compilation activities. He states that he wrote three hours per day, and he· figures that if in one hour he filled one sheet of paper of over one hundred lines, his yearly production was some one thousand sheets. None of the works that he wrote in this manner was published (with the exception of the Premier Volume Je Ia Bibliotheque), which means that it is difficult to evaluate the results of his assiduous labours. It is certain, however, that his work was organized intellectually according to the principle of the notebook or the commonplace book and that it gathered under one heading extracts from various authors' works. Hence the central importance that La Croix du Maine gives to the instruments for putting order into this proliferating material, the 'three hundred tables of commonplaces that I have made to clarify my purpose . . . inasmuch as these tables serve as a key to explain what I have written in entire articles'. La Croix du Maine's work also differed from Doni's in that the Premier Volume of his Bibliotheque was 'dedicated and presented to the King', whose engraved portrait
78

Libraries without Walls
figured on the page facing the dedication addressed to him. In both the Desseins, ou Projects of 1583 and the Premier Volume de Ia Bibliotheque published the following year La Croix du Maine pursued the same aim of obtaining the sovereign's protection, which had a cash value in terms of gratifications and posts. The proposition that he submitted in 1583 fitted into this logic of monarchical patronage. It provides a plan to erect a Library, perfect and accomplished in all points, if it please his Majesty to accept it and to furnish the Books, Memoirs, or Collections to fill the one hundred Bookcases whose form or fashion is represented here: each of these containing one hundred volumes, which in all number ten thousand, divided into Books, Chapters, Notebooks, and commonplaces, and further reduced to order of A, B, C in order to locate them more easily. The originality of this 'notice to erect a library', which preceded Naude's project by a half century, lay in La Croix du Maine's desire to embody the immaterial and universal library of loci communes in a real library, one of whose bookcases (one of the cent Buffits) is figured on one page of the work. l-Ie was less interested in accumulating books than in gathering under the one hundred (actually 108) topics that corrresponded to as many buffets works in various forms (printed books but also memoirs and manuscript compilations): 'all that can be found in writing touching that chosen matter ... reduced to such a number and such an order that it will be quite difficult to find anything to change in it.' Secure in his experience and his manuscripts, La Croix du Maine claimed that he could bring together in eight or fifteen days the works needed to fill any one of the one hundred (or 108) buffits.
79

Libraries without Walls
Thus it was on the basis of the practice of the commonplace book that the totally original system of classification proposed by La Croix du Maine should be understood. 25 The work was divided into seven 'orders': 'sacred things', 'arts and sciences', 'description of the Universe both in general and in particular', 'the human race', 'famous men in War', 'the works of God', and 'miscellanies of various Memoirs', subdivided into a total of 108 'classes'. Unlike the twenty-one categories in Gesner's Pandectarum sive Partitiotlum, universalium ... libri XXI (Zurich, 1548), this organization was not intended to construct a tree of knowledge that proceeded by successive divisions. In Gesner's work, the artes et scientia that make up philosophia are divided into substantiales (subdivided into physica or naturali philosophia, metaphysica et theologia gentilium, ethica or morali philosophia, oeconomica, politica, jurisprudentia, medicina, theologia christiana) and praeparantes. The latter category is subdivided into ornantes (historia, geographia, divinatio et magia, and artes illiteratae et mechanicae) and necessariae. The latter are subdivided into mathematicae (arithmetica, geometria, musica, astronomia, and astrologia) and sermocinales, which were grammatica et philologia, dialectica, rhetorica, and poetica. A 'Tabula de singulis pandectarum libris' arranges the various bibliographical classes according to a systematic order, the order of the divisions of philosophia, understood as a trajectory of knowledge leading from the trivium and the quadrivium to Christian theology. There is none of this in the taxonomy proposed by La Croix du Maine, which has no overall governing system, but simply juxtaposes convenient headings in view of gathering together extracts and commonplaces. The fourth 'order', for example, includes the bookcases devoted to 'Man and what is dependent on him', 'Diseases 80

Libraries without Walls
of Men and their remedies', 'Illustrious and other Women', 'Worldly Wisdom, or Instruction for men', 'Divers exercises of Nobles and Gentlemen', 'Miscellaneous exercises fo~ the mind or the body', 'Divers traffics and commerce of men on sea and on land', 'Divers customs and fashions of living everywhere in the universe', 'Men of honest exercise', and 'Officers of long robe, or of the Judiciary'. Because it was to be an example worthy of being imitated, the 'perfect and accomplished' library set up by the king was to be 'the means for rendering the less learned or the totally ignorant well informed and knowledgeable, and also to make the vice-ridden exercise virtue if they conform to their Prince'. Similarly, only the approval of the king could give authority to the Premier Volume de Ia Bibliotheque published in 1584 and to all the other books that were supposed to follow it. At the end of his dedicatory epistle, signed 'FRAN~OIS DE LA CROIX DV MAINE, the anagram for which is RACE DV MANS, SI FIDEL' A soN Rov', La Croix du Maine suggests a more concrete version of the connection with the sovereign: 'If your Majesty should desire to know what are the other [volumes] that I have written and composed for the ornamentation and illustration of your so famous and flourishing Kingdom, I am ready to provide a reading (when it may please you to so command me) of the Discourse that I had printed five years ago touching the general catalogue of my works.' Doni's Libraria had multiple dedicatees (one for each letter of the alphabet) and was aimed at a broader audience. La Croix du Maine's Bibliotheque supposes an exclusive relationship, established in proximity by reading aloud, between an author in search of protection and the monarch whose patronage he seeks. 81

Libraries without Walls
A final difference between Doni's work and that of La Croix du Maine is that the Florentine's work was solidly connected with publishing activities; it was 'constructed in direct contact with (and probably backed by) two of the publishers of greatest cultural importance in the midsixteenth century', the Venetians Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, the publisher of the first edition and of the complete edition of the work, and Francesco Marcolini, the publisher of the Seconda Libraria. 26 La Croix du Maine's work originated in the construction of his private library, begun in his university years. That was the collection of printed books and manuscript memoirs that La Croix du Maine had transported to Paris in 1582:
I will say that after having been thirteen or fourteen years

writing, collecting, and seeking Memoirs everywhere, and finally seeing that I had a good many (to the number of seven or eight hundred volumes) I decided to make my home in Paris and, to that effect,· I had three wagons loaded with my volumes and Memoirs and with books, both written by hand and otherwise, taken there, and I arrived in Paris on the last day of May in the year 1582.

The library that La Croix du Maine gathered together and, in part, produced provided support for all his undertakings. For one thing, it was something like a prefiguration of the hundred-bookcase library that he proposed to the king (which was what led him to state that 'the most difficult part of the enterprise is done'). For another, his library formed the matrix of all the ideal libraries that he was to imagine. The library published in 1584 was in fact little more than an Epitome of a more ambitious undertaking, the projected Grande Bibliotheque Fran,oise (and its twin, a Bibliotheque Latine). In these two 82

Libraries without Walls
works (never published) the authors' nan1es were to be accompanied by information on editions, dedicatees, and the texts:
I was not content to have put in those Latin and French

Libraries the catalogue of the works or writings of each author, but beyond that I included by whom they were printed, in what size or format, in what year, how many pages they contained, and above all the name of those men or women to whom they were dedicated, without omitting their full and entire qualities. Aside from that, I put in the beginning or first line of their work and composition and in what age their authors lived.

Imitating Gesner, La Croix du Maine added to his Bibliotheques volumes of Pandectes Latines et Fran,oises ('to wit, a very ample Catalogue of all the Authors who have written in each art, science or profession of studies, which I have divided according to the seven arts that we call liberal') and several volumes of what he called a mentionnaire, 'which is like a book of commonplaces, or an Aggregation of authors who have made mention of particular things'. Claiming to have scrutinized the works of 'ten thousand authors', La Croix du Maine notes that in these mentionnaires (also unpublished) he 'quotes passages of the said authors further observing and noting in what book, what chapter or what article, on what leaf, even on what page or side can be found what I have read, and in what size is the book, and of what printing'. Three different principles of classification exist concurrently in La Croix du Maine's works. The first organizing criterion is the category of the author. The authorfunction, as Foucault defines it, is already sketched out here. 27 In the one published volume as in his Grande Bibliotheque, La Croix du Maine makes this the basic

83

Libraries without Walls
criterion for assigning discourses, which are organized alphabetically by their authors' given names. In announcing that he will provide authors' 'lives' (written, La Croix du Maine tells us, in imitation of Suetonius, Plutarch, and Paolo Giovio), he equates men of letters with military leaders, famous for their exploits, and with princes and grandees, masters of their deeds. None the less, this first scheme for assigning works did not neglect the power of patronage. La Croix du Maine demonstrates this when he promises to note, for all the works mentioned in his unpublished Grande Bibliotheque, 'above all [emphasis mine] the name of those men and women to whom they were dedicated, without omitting their full and entire qualities'. A work thus belongs as much to the person to whom it has been dedicated as it does to the person who has written it and, in the ideal library as on the title page, the two names of the author and the patron stood as proof of this. A third criterion for classifying works eliminates assignment to an individual in favour of placing each work within an order or class of knowledge. It is the tension between the name and the commonplace that underlies Gesner's dual enterprise, the Bibliotheca universalis of 1545 and the Pandectarum . . . libri XXI three years later - a work that was presented as 'Secondus hie Bibliothecae nostrae Tomus est, totius philosophiae et omnium bonarum artium atque studiorum Locos communes et Ordines universales simul et particulares complectens.' That same tension is reflected in La Croix du Maine's bibliographic zeal, even though his grandiose projects were never realized. The almost simultaneous publication of the two Bihliotheques (May 1584 for La Croix du Maine; 1585, with an end printing date of 15 December 1584 for Du Verdier) 84

Libraries without Walls
raises a problem. La Croix du Maine took the initiative and parried any possible accusation that he had plagiarized a work that had not yet been published but whose publication he knew was imminent, as proved .by the entry under 'Antoine du Verdier' in the Premier Volume Je Ia Bibliotheque: 'I have been assured that he is about to have printed a Bibliotheque Fran,oise of his own, of which I am not jealous.' Declaring furthermore that he never knew of the existence of Du Verdier's work, La Croix du Maine claims anteriority for his own venture, begun more than fifteen years before, and stresses the great distance ('more than a hundred leagues') that separated their places of residence, Paris and Lyons, where Du Verdier had settled in 1580. For good measure, La ·Croix du Maine states his scorn of plagiarism: 'I will confess to having undertaken to write a book against such kinds of people, usurpers taking credit for the work of others, which work I have entitled "The Rod, or the Scourge of Plagiarists", or of those who attribute to themselves and put under their own names works or compositions of which they are not the authors or inventors.' Furthermore, he founds the authority of his own book on the resources of his library and on his own knowledge: 'As for the authors I have mentioned in my work, I have seen or read them, and have them still before me for the most part without having borrowed them, for I will firmly say that I have never owed any Bookseller for books, and I have spent more than ten thousand livres in the fifteen or sixteen years since I began to love letters.' As in the travel narrations of the age, auto-psie - the action of seeing with one's own eyes ('I have seen them') - became the exclusive guarantee of truth. That certification of authenticity by direct experience is not without paradox in an author who compiles

85

Libraries without Walls
extracts and commonplaces in innumerable notebooks that he then presents as learning itself. Du Verdier (who was first a financial officer in the election of Forez, then controleur general des finances in Lyons), 28 weighed heavier in the social scales than La Croix du Maine, a simple provincial gentleman who had moved to Paris. Du Verdier's response was two-pronged: first, he mocked the erudite fanfaronades of his rival and expressed doubts about the existence of the many works La Croix du Maine promised: Someone (whose name I will not mention} who has sent me a great notebook and inventory of the books that he says he has composed before he was yet twenty years old [the catalogue of his works that La Croix du Maine had printed in 1579], which have surpassed five hundred volumes in number, decorated with the handsomest titles that one could imagine and which contain more than one hundred pages - a ridiculous and unbelievable, if not impossible, thing. Furthermore, after Du Verdier had a look at the work in question (which he lists as being printed in Paris in his entry 'Fran~ois de La Croix du Maine' in his own Bibliotheque), he questions the accuracy of the information given by La Croix du Maine because he surveys fictitious or unproductive authors and includes in his work 'several [authors] that never were in nature, or if they were, have written nothing, as he himself confesses'. In its format (a heavy folio volume) and in its form (organized alphabetically by name), Antoine Du Verdier's Bibliotheque was akin to La Croix du Maine's work, but it is constructed on a different principle. Du Verdier's

86

Libraries without Walls
imagined library is not directly dependent upon the · constitution of the author's own collection but is rather a conceptual entity detached from any particular material presence. Du Verdier's catalogue is indeed a 'library', but it is an all-inclusive library: 'As in the Library divers books are organized, where they are kept as if in their proper place, thus as many divers Authors and books are here put in such an order that at first sight one can locate them in their place and thus remen1ber them.' In this exhaustive inventory every reader must be able to find what he or she needed and use that information to construct a library made up of real books. It was in order to facilitate that task that Antoine Du Verdier gave the bibliographic information that was lacking in the Epitome published by La Croix du Maine. As the title states, the work promises 'the place, fortn, name, and date, where, how, and by whom [the works listed] were brought to light [that is, printed]'. There was thus no contradiction between the design of a 'universal library of French books', which necessarily had no physical reality, and the making of a bibliographic instrument useful to all those who might want to create a collection. In parallel fashion, the attempt to be complete that led l)u Verdier to mention Lutheran and Calvinist authors who wrote in French led to another aim: to make sure that 'Catholics are warned which books are reproved and censured so that they will flee then1'. Whatever Du Verdier's own religious sentiments may have been, his Bibliotheque is thus explicitly invested with the same function as the catalogues of censured books put out by the Faculty of Theology of Paris, whose Index was first published in 1544, also using authors' names listed in alphabetical order (of family nan1es, however) as the primary criterion for classifying titles. 29

87

Libraries without Walls
The various meanings given to the term for a library thus clearly show one of the major tensions that inhabited the literate of the early modern age and caused them anxiety. A universal library (or at least universal in one order of knowledge) could not be other than fictive, reduced to the dimensions of a catalogue, a nomenclature, or a survey. Conversely, any library that is actually installed in a specific place and that is made up of real works available for consultation and reading, no matter how rich it might be, gives only a truncated image of all accumulable knowledge. The irreducible gap between ideally exhaustive inventories and necessarily incomplete collections was experienced with intense frustration. It led to extravagant ventures assembling - in spirit, if not in reality - all possible books, all discoverable titles, all works ever written. 'When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all· books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness.'

88

Epilogue

As the twentieth century wanes, our dream is to be able to surmount the contradiction that long haunted Western Europeans' relationship with the book. The library of the future seems indeed to be in a sense a library without walls, as were the libraries that Gesner, Doni, and La Croix du Maine erected on paper. Unlike their catalogues, which furnished authors' names, the titles of works, and at times summaries of or extracts from the works, the library of the future is inscribed where all texts can be summoned, assembled, and read: on a screen. In the universe of remote communications made possible by computerized texts and electronic diffusion, texts are no longer prisoners of their original physical, material existence. Separated from the objects on which we are used to finding them, texts can be transmitted in a new form; there is no longer a necessary connection between where they are conserved and where they are read. The opposition long held to be insurmountable between the closed world of any finite collection, no matter what its size, and the infinite · universe of all texts ever written is thus theoretically annihilated: now the catalogue of all catalogues ideally

Epilogue
listing the totality of written production can be realized in a universal access to texts available for consultation at the reader's location. This projection towards the future, written here in the present tense, retains something of the basically contradictory utopias proposed by Louis-Sebastien Mercier and Etienne Boullee. Still, it is perhaps not too soon to reflect on the effects of the change that it thus promises and announces. If texts are emancipated from the form that has conveyed them since the first centuries of the Christian era - the codex, the book composed of quires from which all printed objects with which we are familiar derive - by the same token all intellectual technologies and all the operations at work in the production of meaning will be modified. 'Forms effect meanings', D. F. McKenzie reminds us/ and his lesson, which should be taken to heart, warns us to be on guard. against the illusion that wrongly reduces texts to their semantic content. When it passes from the codex to the monitor screen the 'same' text is no longer truly the same because the new formal devices that offer it to its reader modify the conditions of its reception and its comprehension. When the text is carried by a new technique and embodied in a new physical form, it can be offered to manipulation by a reader who is no longer limited, as with the printed book, to adding hand-written matter in the spaces left blank in typographic composition and in binding. 2 At the same time, the end of the codex will signify the loss of acts and representations indissolubly linked to the book as we now know it. In the form that it has acquired in Western Europe since the beginning of the Christian era, the book has been one of the most powerful metaphors used for conceiving of the cosmos,

90

Epilogue
nature, history, and the human body. 3 If the object that has furnished the matrix of this repertory of images (poetic, philosophical, scientific) should disappear, the references and the procedures that organize the 'readability' of the physical world, equated with a book in codex form, would be profoundly upset as well. Realizing the dream of the Renaissance bibliographers of making the particular place in which the reader finds himself or herself coincide perfectly with universal knowledge, thus putting that knowledge within grasp, inevitably presupposes a new definition of the concept of the text, wrenched away from its immediate association {so evident to us) with the specific fortn of the book- the codex - that some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago replaced another form, the volumen or roll. 4 The historian's musings proposed in the present work thus lead to a question essential in our own present time - not the overworked question of the supposed disappearance of writing, which is more resistant than has been thought, but the question of a possible revolution in the forms of its dissemination and appropriation.

16 See the analysis in Carla Hesse, 'Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship'. Hesse emphasizes the impact of Condorcet's and Sieyes's position on revolutionary legislation: 'The democratic bourgeois revolution did not mark a further step in the progressive consolidation of the notion of the author. Rather, the revolutionaries explicitly intended to dethrone the absolute author, a creature of privilege, and recast him, not as a private individual (the absolute bourgeois), but rather as a public servant, as the model citizen' (p. 130). 17 See Woodmansee, 'The Genius and the Copyright', esp. her analysis (pp. 444-6) of the distinction between form and content as proposed by Fichte in his essay, 'Beweis der Unrechtmassigkeit des Buchernachdrucks: Ein Rasonnement und eine Parabel' (1793). 18 Roland Mortier, L'originalite: Une nouvelle categorie esthetique au siecle des Lumieres (Droz, Geneva, 1982). 19 Martha Woodmansee, 'The Interests in Disinterestedness: Karl Philip Moritz and the Emergence of the Theory of Aesthetic Autonomy in Eighteenth-Century Germany', Modern Language Quarterly, 45 (1984), pp. 22-47. 20 On the evolution of this change, see Eric Walter, 'Les auteurs et le champ litteraire', in Histoire de /'edition Jran,aise, ed.

Nel terzo, si /egg(~ l'inventione dell'Academie, insieme cott i soprattomi, i motti, le imprese, et /'opere fatte da tutti gli Academici (Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, Venice, 1557). It is worth noting that unlike the Bibliotheques of La Croix du Maine and Du Verdier, which were published in monumental folio editions, the works of Anton Francesco Doni were easy to handle and to carry since they were printed in smaller formats, duodecimo for the 1550 edition and octavo in 1557.

Keith Michael Baker (Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1987), pp. 261-91. 35 Foucault's essay has been read in two ways. One way stresses the connection between the author-function and the philosophical and juridical definition of the individual and of private property (see Hesse, 'Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship', p. 109: 'The relation between the "author" and the "text,'' (Foucault) suggests, emerged historically as the cultural incarnation of a new axis in sociopolitical discourse: the inviolable relation between the rights-bearing individual and private property'). The other way emphasizes the dependence of the author-function on state and church censorship (as with Joseph Loewenstein, who recognizes, speaking of Foucault in 'The Script in the Marketplace', p. 111, 'His nearly exclusive concentration of the effect of the censoriousness of Church and State on the development of modem authorship has been salutary, though it slights the effect of the market in books on that development'). The first reading leads to emphasizing the eighteenth century; the second, the sixteenth century. 36 J. M. De Bujanda, Francis M. Higman, James K.

Reading Interface

INTERFACE, WE THINK, IS THE SCREEN, THE DISPLAY, THE PORTAL INTO THE ONLINE WORLD OR COMPUTER. THE GUI (GRAPHICAL USER INTERface), with its menu bars and navigational buttons, is so familiar that we tend to overlook the "gooeyness" of it--the mutable, mediating activity--and take interface for a thing, static, stable, and xed. Or we take it as a representation of computational processes, a convenient translation of what is "really going on" inside. Neither could be further from actuality. e GUI is a specialized subset of interface broadly considered. e mediating structures of interface signify by their graphical organization (they do not just display information "transferred" to us by reading). Our task is to understand how they organize our relation to complex systems (rather than how they represent them) and, maybe more important but less tangible, to understand how an interface works as a boundary space (though it masquerades as a rei ed image or menu of options). As the double entendre of my title suggests, we face the challenge of reading interface as an object and of understanding it as a space that constitutes reading as an activity. We can begin reading a GUI by paying attention to its perceptible features. We can look at the graphical, compositional, and navigational conventions and attempt to understand their rhetorical value. But we can also look at the historical developments of interface across the specialized fields of design, engineering, human-computer interaction, and cognitive studies to tease out the assumptions on which these developments were based. Broadly construed, interface is ubiquitous. e techno-human mediations of control panels, dashboards, toaster ovens, homeentertainment units, plumbing xtures, and card catalogs linked to shelving systems are all instances of interface. We rarely "read" these interfaces as "texts" outside cultural studies class exercises, though students in design environments are generally asked to create a working model for remediating common tasks as formal instructions coded into a plan of menus or buttons. e more tangible features

of an analog interface (o en the skin over an electronic operating system) remind us that the GUI's roots are physical, tactile, and haptic, providing a useful segue to the discussion of the history of approaches to its design. Punch cards were an interface based on the straightforward assumption that a mechanical device could perform methodical, formalized, step-by-step processes, thus enacting the instructions that constitute algorithms. Their long history dates back to eighteenth- century Jacquard looms and early calculating devices. But when brought into play for computational programming, they superseded an even more cumbersome interface: switches and circuits that "set" a program through tedious patterns of steps that translated binary instructions from a large panel of toggles into a language that the machine could read. In the late 1940s, the beginning of the era of stored programs and the transformative work of John von Neumann, switches were already seen as an advance over plugging and unplugging circuits. Mainframe iconography retains a Dr. Who appeal as a special effect for science fiction spoofs or retro set design, but the holy grail was a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) graphical interface. Flight simulators were the first prototypes for immersive interface design, created to enhance performance, lower risk, and optimize the deployment of personnel in missions, whether military or commercial. ese cockpit hybrids of the virtual and the physical created a spatial expression of the complex relation of probabilistic behavior to an environment of cues designed to engineer performance in a human being. Visual feedback, as well as physical sensation, was crucial. The symbolic model of a world structured around tasks is a perfect demonstration of the "interface theory of perception" developed later by the cognitive studies scholar Donald Ho man. Other scenes of origin include Douglas Engelbart's now clumsy-looking, handmade

wooden mouse and his insight that any digital information could be displayed on a screen (gleaned from his experience with radar), the head sets and gloves of the University of Washington Human Interface Technology Lab's virtual-reality experiments, and Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad and his crude 1970 head-mounted display. Two overlooked but useful detours, the Sensorama bicycle, designed by Morton Heilig in 1962 (Father), and the 1960s experiments of the light-and-media artist Myron Krueger ("Myron W. Krueger"), promoted the notion of the body as the ultimate user interface. These were explicitly embodied experiences, augmented later by Jaron Lanier and others who assumed that the entire sensorium had to be tricked into a "satis cing" illusion in the virtual space (Web Resources). But the force of the symbolic trumps this requirement. Our ability to identify with the screen space overwhelms any need to literalize analogies with "real" space. We speak of "going to" an online site as if it were a place rather than a refreshed screen in a browser on our desktop. The doomed interface Microso Bob, from 1995, with its kitschy replica of an o ce, was a quintessential demonstration of how literal representation is less e ective than abstraction. In t he 1960s a nd 1970s, on ly t he command-line interface was available. It had a steep learning curve and assumed specialized knowledge--the ability to grasp the complexities of an operating system and interact through instructions encoded in the lines of text on the screen ("Command-Line Interface"). is had limited market appeal, and in the 1970s researchers at Xerox PARC developed programming and interface prototypes now integrated into our daily screens (Hiltzik). Among them was Alan Kay, who drew on the cognitive theories of Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner to create a graphical language of icons and actions grounded in constructivist approaches to learning and narrative models of the world. Kay, the

programmer Dan Ingalls , and the graphic designer Norman Cox are responsible for developing the rst generation of the GUI as we know it through their early WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) model. At the end of that decade, Steve Jobs hired Kay to help design the Lisa and Macintosh computers for Apple, launched in 1983 and 1984 (Booth). us, by the mid-1980s the rst generation of mass-market devices with windows or desktop metaphors became available. Computer users divided into those who wanted to look through the display and those who wanted to look at it. e windows and desktop metaphors have equaled in suggestive potency the old poetic images of mirror and lamp, with their tropes of re ection and illumination (Abrams). But as graphical icons became linked to more sophisticated, objectoriented programming, they no longer just looked like objects; they could also mimic the behavior of the things they resembled. A le folder might not open on-screen the way it does in the hand, but an analogy supported the functional interaction. Expectations for user-friendly engagement escalated. Objectoriented programming gave screen icons the properties of the analog elements they seemed to represent. e intellectual, theoretical, and computational leaps involved are stunning. We now take them for granted, but in an abstracted world whose abstraction we no longer see. e assumption was correct: metaphors could enable behavior by analogy. In the 1990s Ben Shneiderman and his lab at the University of Maryland created guidelines for effective interface design. Building on the protocols of le transfer, Web addresses, and markup languages, Shneiderman's "Eight Golden Rules" took into account the kinds of metrics provided by psychology experiments--how many things one can keep in short-term memory, what cues carry over from one screen to the next, what levels of scale, search results, and detail are comprehensible. ey are commonsense guidelines,

forged from much hard work, such as "Permit easy reversal of actions" and "O er informative feedback" for every "operator action." Shneiderman's lab originated many features of interactive sites--like sliders, data-entry forms, and other e ective, consumer-oriented Web front-end display mechanisms that assumed users must be grati ed in their relation to the machine through clicks, sounds, and so on if they were going to want to search, shop, and gather information in an interface. "Task optimization" became the watchword among the interface community, in the 1990s particularly, as networked environments came online. In uenced by Jakob Nielson's work on Web usability, the task of interface design was conceived as mediating between a complex information structure (e.g., data, metadata, display protocols, processing and storage elements) and the user's behaviors and needs. A milestone published in 2000, Jesse James Garrett's much- cited graph exposed the tension between information organization and task support in the design of interface. What you see is never what is "going on" computationally, nor is it a view into the le structures. A popular example of current professional attitudes toward interface design, Steve Krug's witty but pointed Don't Make Me ink is the New Age equivalent of Beatrice Warde's embrace of the crystal goblet, the idea that the best typography is invisible. Krug assumes that a successful interface disappears, so easy to use it is transparent, naturalized, and perceived as simply "what is" on the screen. Part of his analysis uses evidence produced through eye-tracking experiments and other clinical trials to con rm what all users know--we read selectively, driven as often by whim and mood as by tasks and goals. Structuring an interface, like writing a book, only launches a probabilistic missive in the direction of a user or reader, whose interpretation produces a reading that is necessarily an act of "deformance."

Reading Interface

User-centered approaches, such as those embodied in Krug's whimsical handbook, are now standard. But guidelines for e ective engineering stand in the same relation to interface theory as the analysis of plumbing xtures does to the history of personal-hygiene training and its e ects on the development of the psyche. Our constitution as subjects is integral to use; we are in constant formation in relation to interface. With this history and its practical as well as theoretical considerations in view, we can think beyond representational models and their long-standing hold on the critical imagination. We have to understand interface as a constitutive boundary space, not just a place of mechanistic negotiation and exchange among elements. Interface is o en de ned as an encounter between systems. But that encounter need not be understood mechanistically. It could be understood ecologically, as a border zone between cultural systems, with all the complexity and emergent relations that suggests. This notion does not follow intuitively from reading graphical and formal structures. Sociologists, engineers, and cognitive scientists of many stripes use the term interface. ey describe it according to the tenets of their disciplines, but always in a relational paradigm. e way the relational activity is construed has implications for how interface is read, especially if we are to shed the notion of an interface as a thing. In a 2009 paper outlining his interface theory of perception, Hoffman argued that the schemes by which animal species organize their relations with the world have little or nothing to do with representing it in any "veridical" way and everything to do with making icon models. In other words, we adapt to the environment through an interface, an abstraction, a set of icons that do not represent what is real but support "su cing" behaviors. e mental models are made up of organizing elements that support the activities su cient for survival. We don't need a picture of

the world to get by, any more than we need to know the "real" processing activity in a computer to send an e-mail message. A vivid example of Hoffman's principles in interface design is "real time" refresh--a result of processing that is above the threshold of our cognitive perception of the machine. Nothing about it is real; the processing simply conforms to our perceptual model of real time as immediate--a kind of clock rate of our organism's capacities. Eyes, brains, capacities also mutate; we adapt, altered by interface. e GUI is a mediating scrim, a boundary space in which we interact with an abstraction of computation, not a window through which information passes like fast food at a drive-through. We manipulate hidden circuits, chips, and processors by using icons that serve as metaphors once removed, logical analogues to behaviors whose cues we can follow by inference. I know that if I see a le folder on-screen I can place something in it. That folder is a behavioral cue, not a representation either poetic or literal. Icons do not show the processes that make them functional. We don't see the computer, any more than we rely on a picture of the world. We work with abstractions built on top of the computer's capacities. e screen metaphors we have come to rely on have no analogy to the a ordances engineered into the operating system. And they bear only a faint relation to the objects in the physical world that they mimic. e le folders, pages, and documents that we access digitally allow what the renowned designer Donald Norman initially referred to in 1993 as "experiential or reactive cognition." We can work, follow cues, "react to a rich set of information" as presented by the screen environment (qtd. in Lynch). Our familiarity with the metaphors blinds us to their nonrepresentational status and to their primary function as cues for actions. Neither the file folders nor the other objects in the screen space are things; they are icons that represent behaviors and actions we

want to perform (or kinds of les we want to access), and they interpellate a user through disciplinary and scopic regimes. In the constitutive exchange, the e ect is not merely efcient tasking but also cognitive adaptation and change. Interface is a space of individual and collective subject formation. Our notions of privacy, property, identity, and even individual voice and self are modi ed constantly in the exchange, bound to the cognitive modeling of experience through experience. As a reading interface, the GUI is a microcosm of constitutive modeling. To return to the more apparently tractable part of our task, we can read the GUI by adopting many of the critical approaches we inherit from semiotics, gestalt psychology, critical cultural and visual studies, and bibliography, among other elds. In one wellwrought study, Mads Soegaard conducts a point- by-point analysis of the GUI using gestalt principles. Proximity relations, continuity, resemblance--all can be brought to bear on the rhetorical semantics of graphical organization, because they construct meaning rather than simply present it. Textual and literary readers are sometimes disinclined to consider the graphical dimensions of texts. But just as the language of a work constrains its semantic eld (however wild the interpretations provoked), so the graphical codes give initial rhetorical structure to the presentation of a work in any visually perceptible format. e features of the codex book came into being to enable various reading practices, as the medievalist Malcolm Parkes makes evident. In the same way, the structures of the standard interface have organized around other reading practices. Taking a lesson from bibliographic studies, we can read an interface as a paratextual apparatus. Like tables of contents, indexes, marginalia, and commentary, an interface performs rhetorically, presenting an argument as if it were a statement of fact, but engages us by presenting options. Go here, follow this, click, point, play, listen, search--

all commands that are motivated by behaviors constrained by features and structures. Describing structures of information, Geo rey Bowker and Susan Star took apart the ideological and political underpinnings of data sets and classi cation systems, subjecting the elements of interface to a Foucauldian critique. Power relations and disciplinary techniques order our relation to use, and we are never more clearly subjects of regimes of scopic control than in our interactions with what Simon Penny once termed the "interpassivity" of the screen environment, usually mischaracterized as interactive. The new-media critics Brenda Laurel (Computers and Art), Gretchen Bender and Timothy Druckrey, Margaret Morse, and Henry Jenkins and David orburn o ered useful conceptual frames for exposing the media-speci c theatricality and psychodramatic identi cation of viewers absorbed into the ow of online and other digital environments. Their work, complemented by that of the sociologists attentive to computermediated communication and comparative media studies (e.g., Thurlow, Lengel, and Tomic), has developed useful discussions of power, control, democracy, identity, and the transformation of nearly every aspect of contemporary life. In the design community, Aaron Marcus and a team working with Jakob Nielson produced a pioneering study of cultural mores, social codes, and information structures and provided early and still-valid principles for looking at the unexamined cultural assumptions built into interface design. e group assessed the context-dependent associations of fundamental graphical principles such as hierarchy, symmetry, and spatial organization (Ackerman). A more extensive curriculum for reading interface as the screen space involves forays into the history of graphic design (the rhetoric of style and composition), visual forms (iconography), visualization techniques

(remediation of digital files), information graphics (techniques of display production), multimedia editing (crosscutting, framing, sequencing, etc.), lm and other visual and audio technologies, and media theory. The cognitive load for processing media with multiple temporal modalities, distinct spatial coordinates and systems, or demands for embodied engagement goes beyond any explanation that can be provided by comparisons with lm or video. Interface is more complex in the challenges it presents to what can be referred to as "frame jumping"--shi ing cognitive reference frames--than lm ever was. e early days of describing the "language of new media" as if we were just in an advanced state of avant- garde film work set critical studies back, until the structural and cognitive di erences of new media were explored in more-extensive arguments. ese stressed that when we are engaged in the mental task of reading, viewing, hand-eye coordination, bodily discipline, and audio and video play in a structured (and thus semiotically encoded) environment, we are not watching something unfold. As we make a text, we are produced by it as its subject. is observation does not depend on digital technology. But the means of engagement do enact di erences of degree-- and perhaps of illusion and identi cation. The immersive experiences of virtual worlds and simulacral interface are less taxing than the screen space of, say, the New York Times online, because their apparent seamlessness organizes our experience around a navigational narrative that integrates us into it. In such an environment, actor-network theory breaks down, since it is premised on assumptions of discrete autonomy, distinctions of actor from network, that are at odds with the integrative codependencies of interface experience. e boundary is not between one thing and another; it is the space in which the experiential construction of an in-betweenness that is inclusive, both human and computational, comes into being.

Coming to the end of this overview of interface design as a subtext for reading, we might think about how digital humanities change the game. We can extract an argument from the organization and labeling of tabs, menus, and other navigational features. A new online archive of Vincent van Gogh's letters won kudos from a perceptive critic who argued that its interface was grounded in a bibliographic model (i.e., addressee, chronology, place of origin) distinct from the labeledbucket approach to which so many repositories default (maps, pictures, documents [Vincent van Gogh; Ciula]). The task of designing an interface is probably the best exercise in reading one can provide. Organize a music collection--by artist? by date? by performance? by title? by tasks of browsing, searching, playing? e multifaceted, polymorphous interface has yet to fully emerge, as does the formative environment for argument making as a way to express engagement with that boundary space. New, advanced research agendas driven by a desire to expose interpretation rather than display its results may separate the critical from the engineering practice of digital humanities by revealing interpretative practices instead of by producing representations. In addition to dissecting the reading of interface, we must create theoretical frameworks for discussing reading as interface. Creating such frameworks means returning to the notion of interface as a boundary space. As interface changes in the era of distributed and ubiquitous computing, the screen surface--that apparent image--may go away. e ambient triggers and smart environments offering commercial and cultural opportunities for the integration of stored and programmed information into daily life will increasingly make the world we navigate into an interface. e augmented-reality purveyors o er screen-enhanced viewing of the world around us, a kind of inversion of Plato's cave, in which a mediating scrim stands between us and everything we view in a panoptic projection.

More and more, this integration of cultural constructions into the built and experienced environment (as well as whatever we delimit as the natural one) will argue for the need to address the systems ecology of interface and our mutating adaptations. at the mediating sites, instruments, protocols, and devices are systemic and that the critical understanding of their operation requires recognition of their and our emergent codependence are the real lessons on which reading interface depends. Interface, increasingly, will be the experience of being in the world. Distinctions between rst- and second-order representations--those symbolic orders of language and image or their simulacral presence--will cease to matter when we realize that we live in a material and symbolic domain of actualized encounters, the boundary spaces of interface relations, through which we imagine our lives into being and give knowledge its forms of expression. At that point, interface will be construed not as representational but as performative and constitutive, and the need for ways of reading that constituting scrim and its naturalized models of what we take for the world will be ever more urgent.

NOTES
1. e term satis cing comes from Ho man. 2. e objects in object-oriented programming are data and their behaviors, not on-screen objects such as icons, but the principle that data are linked to behaviors, tasks, or functions in the programming environment underpins interface design. The change from list-based to objectoriented programs altered attitudes toward programming and, though developed before GUI interfaces, was central to their implementation ("Object-Oriented Programming"). Deformance is taken from McGann.

Lucien Febvre

About

the year 1450 some rather unusual 'manuscripts' made their appearance in the northern regions of Western Europe. Although not

very different in appearance from traditional manuscripts, they were 'impressed' on paper, sometimes on vellum, with the mechanical aid of

which used moveable type. The process was simple. But was the object of considerable curiosity and fascination. In fact, these new books were to cause profound changes not only in the habits of
a printing press in the

thought but also

working conditions of

secular and religious

The changes (we won't say revolution) soon broke the bounds of this original audience and made considerable impact on the world outside. The object of the present work is to study those changes, their causes and effects, and show just how the printed book became something the manuscript neither could nor did become, for reasons we will have to analyse in detail. If this book

in the Baltic led to the first of the

many

humiliations to

which this Earth of ours was to be subjected in the succeeding centuries. Thus the printed book played its part in a whole range of basic changes which were taking place at the time, though not all at once, nor in such a manner that their effects were cumulative from the very beginning. Yet how can we understand what all this meant to men of the late i jth and
early i6th centuries unless

grasp the great variety of innovations of

token, an incomparable power for both transformation and propagation. Fresh concepts crossed whole regions of the globe in the very shortest

As usual there is an important preliminary problem how to arrange the book and where to set limits to the subject. We will not use those quite puerile subdivisions based on the artificial distinctions of dates, the kind of thing that is fed to schoolchildren to keep them happy 'On what day, month, and year did the Middle Ages end?' (We would translate such a question thus 'What date, in the mind of its inventors, marked the birth and the death of that intellectual abstraction, with no claim to existence

other than pedagogic convenience?') We propose, without wasting any time on such controversies, to examine the influence and the practical
significance of the printed book during the first 300 years of its existence, from the mid-i5th century to the end of the i8th, that is, the period between two changes of climate. At the beginning stands an epoch of intellectual, social and economic upheaval which was to make a lasting mark on the minds, the attitudes, and the actions of Europeans, and which Michelet in a happy phrase called the Renaissance. Then, at the other end of the period, we deal with the second great epoch, another age of confusion, in which political revolution occurs amid a succession of radical economic and social changes leading in the cultural field to that literary and artistic revolution which, under the name of Romanticism, was to unleash further new ideas and feelings. And finally, despite those rechargings of sensibility which found expression through a

remarkable upsurge of Christianity and through a passionate search for emotional satisfaction linked to the promise of social reform, let us not
forget that
raries

modern industry produced, among those

whom contempo-

began to call the proletariat, a class consciousness oriented towards action and the fulfilment of its demands.

The end of one epoch is the beginning of another. An elite society gave way to a mass society. Printing found itself inevitably drawn to a further profound transformation. New needs and a new clientele. Therefore
mechanisation replaced the old hand press. Therefore, the antagonism developed between craftsman and mechanic, between old-style printing

shop and modern mass production. A series of new inventions quickly followed which did much to increase what we might call the virulence of the press. Slowly the machine found its way into what was soon to

12

become the book industry. The printing press sought out and found a form of motive power different from muscle-power. Between 1803 and
1814 Koenig built three types of machine which were the prototypes of modern printing plant: the power-driven platen press, the stop-cylinder press and the two-revolution press. As early as 1791 an Englishman, Nicholson, had worked out the principle of the cylinder steam press

with self-inking

rollers.

Inventions like these of course greatly acceler-

ated the output of books and prepared the ground for the newspaper, the most recent newcomer yet to the world of print. The newspaper! It
characterises the grip printing had 2oth centuries. All such inventions

on readers in the late i9th and early were the result of great social trans-

formations, but in turn gave further impetus to their development. The whole period is thus of about 400 years duration, from the

Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution.

At the beginning of a book dealing with the evolution of printing in the West, perhaps it is worth briefly recalling the historical role of the
manuscript, for so many centuries the sole written medium through which ideas found expression. It is not our intention to offer a history of the manuscript book, which would require a whole volume to itself, but rather to show how the production of manuscripts was organised from

about the middle of the i3th century to the late ijth in response to growing demand, and to point out what needs the manuscript tried to
fulfil

stage further.

Historians have long divided the evolution of the manuscript in western Europe into two main periods, the 'Monastic Age', and the 'Secular

Age'. These terms, long current in the field, and familiar to anyone who knows something of the subject, may be somewhat lacking in precision,

but nevertheless they do express an undoubted reality. In the 700 years between the Fall of Rome and the izth century, it was the monasteries

and other

ecclesiastical establishments associated

with them which

enjoyed an almost complete monopoly of book production and so of book culture. It is also true that from the end of the i2th century a profound transformation took place. The social and intellectual changes

which are particularly clearly reflected in the founding of the universities and the development of learning among the laity, and which occurred at the same time as the bourgeoisie emerges as a class, had profound
repercussions on the ways in which books came to be written, copied and distributed. In this short survey we will ignore the Monastic Age which has been

folded into booklets of six or eight leaves. When cahiers are mentioned in accounts we have no way of knowing their dimensions or even the

number of pages, and so we can draw no

firm conclusions about costs.

At the end of the i4th century the price of skins varied between 12 and 20 deniers in Paris. The average area of a skin being about Y2 a square metre, ten to twelve were needed to make a volume of 150 leaves measuring 24 cmx 16 cm, typical dimensions of a manuscript book in the i4th-i jth centuries. The raw material from which such a book was made could thus be worth anything from 10 to 20 sous in its crude state, and to this we would have to add 4 to 6 deniers for preparing it, i.e. clearing the surface of the remaining bristles and of other blemishes to

Countess of Clare in England in 1 3 24 for a copy of the 1/itae Pafrum, for which no fewer than 1,000 skins were allegedly required. At the current
price of 2 pennies per skin, the vellum alone would have cost the fabulous sum of 6. In fact an examination of the Vitae Patrum, whether in Latin

or in one of the contemporary French versions, quickly shows that when written in two columns the text generally fills about 150-160 leaves of

But was there an abundant supply of parchment? In France as in England its price remained reasonably stable from the second half of the
half of the ijth century, when book production was increasing rapidly, and this seems to prove that it was not such a rare commodity. It would be interesting to study the number of livestock,

mentary on well established authorities was all important in every field of learning. It was therefore indispensable for them to have these works
conveniently to hand, and the university would have to provide a library where they could consult them. But it was not always possible to secure texts already in existence, and so the need arose for the establishment of workshops where professional craftsmen, employed by the university, could copy essential texts expeditiously and cheaply. This did not exclude the use of libraries which existed outside the university, where many rare and useful works could often be found. The loan of books had long been an established practice in the Middle Ages, and various church foundations, such as monasteries and chapters,

loaned out works which they would not have agreed definitively to

To keep proper intellectual as well as economic control over the use of books, the authorities required all essential works to be scrupulously checked for textual correctness so that no errors might slip in, distorting

Anyone who has had to study the transmission of ancient texts understand what a good idea this was. The stationers, apart from multiplying copies themselves, loaned the

copy-text or exemplar to students who either wished to copy it or have it copied by the authorised copyists. It did not go out as one book, but

could be making copies from same manuscript simultaneously. The hiring charge for each quire was determined by the university, and stationers were forbidden to increase it. Moreover they had to loan them to anyone wanting to copy them. If an exemplar was known to be imperfect it was withdrawn from circulation. A number of exemplars have come down to us, often written in a large hand and very worn because of constant use. Since they were

In Paris, for example, it was within the framework of such an organisation that printing was introduced, under the auspices of the university. As far as the authorities were concerned, the printing press simply represented a handy means of multiplying indispensable texts even more rapidly and accurately than was possible

more copies will be requested from the author. He can then have made by a scribe from his own master copy and thus become his own publisher. Boccaccio, for example, 15 in a letter to his friend Maghinardo dei Cavalcanti, which accompanied his gift of a de

understood functions of the patron, because in the dedication of his De claris mulieribus (On Famous Women] to Andreina Acciajuoli, Boccaccio

publication was arranged through the copyists and booksellers. The author participated in the process at least in the early stages, though under conditions that are still rather obscure. He appears to have had

no greater financial interest in ensuring the speedy circulation of his work than the troubadours had in the previous century, because once it had left him it was out of his hands. Yet he had no desire to remain in total obscurity. He had to find a balance between these two opposing
interests.

frequently ordered de luxe editions from the artists domiciled with him and in his pay, also purchased equally fine copies of manuscripts from booksellers. We know for example that in 1403 he acquired a manuscript of the Arthurian tales in prose from a bookseller called Raoul du Montet. 21 The surviving records reveal that the book was bought from a bookseller and not executed by command proof that the clientele with a taste for de luxe editions was large enough for a stationer to order a manuscript to be prepared at considerable expense (it was sold for 300

production methods to improve productivity. Long before this, a degree of specialisation had developed in the monastic scriptoria. Some monks specialised in copying, others in
illumination, according to their talents. But scribe and illuminator still worked side by side in constant collaboration. In the secular age, how-

raw material on which everything else depended was workshops of the copyists. Treasury accounts show that the vellum, which was usually bought in the crude state (parchemin froutiri), passed through the hands of specialist craftsmen whose job was to thin it, shave it and bleach it. The payment of each is usually listed separately. When one artisan had written the text, another (the rubricator) added the initial letters or the chapter headings. A further specialist would do any fine capitals that might be required, whether they were coloured, illuminated or historiated. He would not even read the text, and so, in order to avoid any delay or doubt, the copyist would

this multiplicity and complexity of operations, it has frequently been emphasised that the production of a single book involved a colossal amount of work. Such a view is justified, but we must not generalise

to the Due de Berry, the greatest bibliophile of his day took months if not years of work and cost a fortune. But many other books were also being turned out (editions of the Book of Hours, for example, whose use spread everywhere in Europe in the i4th and 1 5th centuries) which were

So, from the mid- 1 3th century, copyists were forced to improve their methods to meet the growing demand, and this in turn led in some workshops to something very like standardised mass production. By

using theptcia system they succeeded in multiplying university textbooks while avoiding the dangers of reproducing copying mistakes in manuscript after manuscript.

Why did the first printed books appear when they did, about the middle of the jth century? Why was it that everywhere, from Avignon to

mechanical means? Were the reasons purely intellectual? Certainly the scholars of the day, those great readers we call humanists, were constantly

such a pressing motive no one might have begun searching for the solution that came with printing. Certainly, at the beginning of the
1 5th century, a period when so many changes were in gestation, men were forced more and more to think about improving the supply of manuscripts to meet the rising level of demand. From the time of the

were not yet available. Perhaps what was essentially lacking was the technique of making moveable tvpe. An individual letter (a 'sort') requires a metal punch which is used to strike a matrix with great
precision in a block of less hard metal. Individual letters are then cast from the matrices, and have to be made from the proper alloy - all of which indicates why the new art was developed by goldsmiths. But there

would have been impossible, namely paper. What use would it have been to be able to print with moveable type if the only medium was skin, which takes ink poorly, and when only the costliest skin, that of the calf, was flat and supple enough to be used under the press? It would have
been impossible to invent printing had it not been for the impetus given by paper, which had arrived in Europe from China via the Arabs two

which the Arabs used to pulverise rags and so to increase output, reduce costs, and produce paper of superior quality. 29 The second factor was the extended cultivation of flax and hemp at the close of the Middle Ages, and the substitution of linen for wool in the making of underwear. This made for a rag base in paper that was less costly and more plentiful just at the time when paper was coming into general use. With such factors in its favour, the Fabriano trade enjoyed increased prosperity and in 1354 Bartolus the jurist commented on 'the famous town' near Ancona where the best paper was made. The drive to improve quality and quantity made the manufacturers seek better methods, and not only were they the first to use mallets instead of the old grindstone,

They soon established two other major centres of production, in the region of Liguria around Genoa, and around Lake Garda, then part of the Venetian Republic. Italian merchants, and particularly the

Lombards, were the prime promoters of paper throughout Europe. Briquet in his masterly work Les Filigranes shows that the watermark of a winged eagle was common not only in Italy but also in Spain, Holland and Belgium between 1362 and I386, 31 and about 1365 the journal kept by Lodovico di Ambrogio, a papermaker of Fabriano, tells us that he was selling his product in Fano and Perugia. His travels took him by way
of a small port on the Tuscan coast called Talamona to Venice and, by way of Aigues-Mortes, to Montpellier. On the 23rd November, 1365,

against copying texts on paper in 1415 because it was less durable than vellum. 35 By that time, however, such advice was little more than an

expression of nostalgia, since paper had already won the day. One of the indispensable preconditions of the printed book had now been realise'd.

Preconditions of the Growth of Paper-Making Natural and Industrial

:

Before examining the characteristics of those areas which became centres for the manufacture of paper to supply the printing press, the influence

which the location of paper mills had on the location of printing shops and the impetus that the new invention of printing gave the paper trade, let us first determine what preconditions were necessary to the setting

up of a paper

mill.

Firstly, exactly is paper made? The process scarcely changed from the i4th to the i8th century - the replacement of the mallets by cylinders, which took place at the end of the iyth century, being the only 6 major development. 3 The raw material used, old rags, was obtained from specialised dealers, who collected it and brought it to the mill, where it was then sorted. For the best quality paper, printing paper

how

particularly, a flimsy white rag was essential and it had to be separated from the tougher fabrics. After the sorting came the steeping of the rags, which were chopped into small pieces and left in selected places, usually
cellars, to ferment. In this process the fatty substances were forced out and the cellulose gradually separated. The raw stuff" was then brought to the mill, usually a water mill which had been used to grind corn before

easy for the mills along their banks to make paper because their water often stained brown if it has a high iron content, is muddy, or is full

towns, to eliminate various kinds of detritus. For the same reason they were often situated on the higher reaches of the large rivers or on the middle reaches of their tributaries. Such sites could also be ideal sites

Still more important, and more of a worry to the first papermakers, was the supply of rags. To make a decent paper a great quantity of old rags or rope was needed. Hence the search for fabrics naturally led to mills

papermakers appealed to the State to grant them monopolies in rag collection. In 1 366 they obtained at Treviso a privilege of this type from the Venetian Senate, and in 1424 a manufacturer, originally from

of old rope. In the 1450*5, the papermakers of Genoa complained they were under the thumb of the rag merchants and sought to prosecute them. In Switzerland, where mills sprang up in the Basel region, similar

caused initially by a critical shortage of rags. In 1674 Colbert, although aware of the problem and concerned at the decline in the industry, could
find no solution beyond stipulating that papermakers must keep their vats filled with rags! In the i8th century, reading and writing increased sharply and so there was a new crisis of supply and demand. So great was

the dearth of materials in the Auvergne in 1732 and 1733 that the export of rags from that region was forbidden. Moreover, in 1754, the ban was reinforced by refusing to allow the establishment of collecting depots

Eventually it was clear that only new solutions would prevent chronic In 1719 Reaumur had suggested to the Academie des Sciences that

In 1786, Leorier Delisle of Langlee published the works of the Marquis de Villette on paper made from marsh weed, and in England between 1 80 1 and 1804 attempts were made to commercialise similar processes; but all these were pioneer efforts. During the French Revolution paper

was consumed on a vast scale (one of the reasons for the disappearance of so many early French archives). But it was only in 1844 that the idea of mixing wood pulp with rag pulp was conceived by the bookbinder,
Gottlieb Keller. In 1847 Woelter took out a patent for this process. And it was only towards 1860 that straw was definitively and universally
applied as a substitute for rags in the manufacture of newspaper. So as long as rag remained the essential raw material of papermaking -

from the i4th to the i9th centuries - the expansion of the papermaking industry appeared forever threatened by lack of raw materials. At Troyes and perhaps Venice in the i6th century, in the Auvergne and Angoumois in the i7th and :8th centuries, papermakers were forced to sacrifice quality to quantity in face of the increasing demand. They had to use poor quality rag and consequently produced worse paper; customers complained and went elsewhere. New mills began in places where they

Commercial Factors
From
the i4th to the xyth centuries, in response to a growing demand, while shortage of raw material cramped development of the large centres,

new establishments were repeatedly founded in regions which until then had had nothing to do with paper making. In order to enable production to flow more easily, new centres were almost always situated at the
cross-roads of commercial routes, and

consumption.

Here again at the beginning, the Italians, because of their resources of and technical expertise, played an important part. By the late 1 5th century Italian production was no longer enough for European needs, and transport added considerably to the cost of such heavy goods: before delivery to French or German customers paper had to pass through three or four hands. Moreover Lombard merchants abroad were willing to finance the conversion of corn mills to make paper near the profitable markets of France, Switzerland and Germany, and they encouraged skilled craftsmen to leave Italy to teach the new art. So we see a Florentine setting up a small mill at Carpentras (i 374) and we hear of Italian merchants persuading workmen from the Pignerol region to come and start mills around Avignon at the beginning of the i5th 45 Local merchants sometimes invited Italians to do the job.

The history of the paper mills supplying Paris is well known thanks to the works of Stein and Le Clert 47 which prove that the growth of a major industry was made possible by the proximity of an important centre of consumption, like Paris, to the cross-roads of a number of traderoutes, like Troyes. Let us take this as a typical example. The University
of Paris from the mid- 1 4th century wished to lay in stocks of paper
at

the best available rates and assigned the right to start factories at Essones and Troyes to Jean le Bon, their owners being exempted from taxes and
certain duties in their capacity as agents for the University. Nearer still to the capital, at St. Cloud, two citizens of Paris, papermakers, took the

bishop's mill on a long lease in 1376 to make at the said mill 'paper and other commodities such as may be profitable, except that they may not

papermakers set up in the Venice and Genoa districts. In the i6th and i yth centuries, the case of Angouleme is even more striking. During

the English occupation of France in the early i jth century Italian paper had been exported to England via Bordeaux. Then a local industry

developed whose products were exported by way of La Rochelle and Bordeaux. As a consequence, at the end of the iyth century, when

Angouleme paper was famous for its quality, Paris stationers complained that they were obliged to import it overland and so had to pay more for 49 it than their Dutch competitors who received it by sea.

estimate between 500 and 1,000 presses at work in France, so that paper mills had to supply anything from 1,500 to 3,000 reams a day to keep

them in production, which means 450,000 to 900,000 reams a year, if It is not surprising to find that one they were working at full capacity. of Gutenberg's associates owned a paper mill and that the richest men among the papermakers were those who supplied the booksellers, nor was it so surprising that their children were attracted to a career in books and took to printing. They reinvested in the printing of books the money they had made out of the production or sale of paper. Thus the development of papermaking centres favoured the development of printing centres.

In the Angouleme area, which was to be so important in the 1 7th century, there was also a rapid expansion. Proximity to Lyons with its innumerable printing shops and its fairs had encouraged the growth of paper mills in the Beaujolais and especially the Auvergne.

The Wood-Cut, Ancestor of the Book?
By the mid- 1 4th century paper was in use throughout Europe and before the end of that century had become a common commodity. This offered new possibilities, not because of its price, which in fact dropped only slowly, but because it was possible to manufacture large quantities of the new material possessing a perfectly plane surface; hence it was an
ideal

for mass production of pictures and texts.

was used to decorate bindings with designs impressed into leather by means of an engraved (intaglio] plate. In manuscripts the great ornamental capitals which rilled the space left by the copyist at the head of each chapter and paragraph were occasionally made with small embossed stamps made of wood or metal. The technique of block printing of patterns on cloth had come from the East and was used to impress designs on silk or linen fabrics and to produce simple devotional 61 pictures and religious scenes using coloured inks. Paper was well

template them at leisure they could see the miracles of Christ or scenes from the Passion, feel that Biblical characters came to life in their hands, be reminded of the ever-present fact of death or see the fight between

angels and demons for the soul of a dying man. It is not surprising that the need for this kind of simple visual resource was felt long before the

need for printed literary, theological and scientific texts, interest in which was restricted to a small group of clerics and scholars. Even if the

reproduction of such texts had been as easy as that of block prints and this was not the case it would still have been natural and logical for the

block print to precede the printed book. But in fact the technique of the wood-cut did not in any sense inspire printing, which was the result of
a quite different technique. 63

The Technical Problems and

their Solution

At the beginning of the ijth century popular religious iconography developed, and it seems probable that the first workshops producing cuts were in or near monasteries, and that the great monastic orders
64 helped to promote the widespread use of pictures.

a short legend was added, either in a streamer cut out for the purpose, or between the white spaces separating the figures. At first the legends were inscribed by hand, but later they were engraved in the wood with

and animals, or legendary histories such as that of the Nine Champions of Christendom. The most spectacular development was in the making of playing cards, which was soon to become a large and prosperous industry. The cards were printed from blocks and then coloured, no

We have no wish to revive old arguments about which country can rightly claim priority in this art, or the correct dating of this or that print, or the origins and types of occupation of the cutters.

This seductive theory was in vogue among historians of printing in the last century. But no simple version of this theory will stand up to close scrutiny. For one thing many of the cuts, particularly those with a

the wood engraver was quite ignorant of the techniques of casting and making fonts from type metal. Besides, the surviving documents prove clearly that the first printed books did not emerge from wood engravers'

workshops somehow re-adapted to a new process.

This is not to say that the printed book owed nothing to xylography.

The 'Discovery' of Printing
Just what problems faced the

men who were experimenting

in the first

half of the ijth century, trying to find a method for reproducing books by mechanical means? First we must recall some of the essential aspects

JO

of the printing process and then,

briefly, describe the details

of the tech-

nique eventually adopted, which was to remain the basis for printing right up to the Industrial Revolution in the i9th century. The technique of printing by hand can be reduced to three essentials, moveable type cast in metal; a fatty based ink; and the press. 67 The problems of producing an ink thicker than that in common use, and of devising a printing press which would do away with the rubbing technique of the wood engravers, were relatively easy to solve, and we shall not dwell orl them here. They were in any case secondary to the really essential problem on which the whole secret of the art of printing, at least as developed in the West, depends - namely the making up of a page of print from separate, moveable types.
:

what the process involves. For each letter or sign a punch at the end of which the letter is engraved in relief. The punch is used to strike a die in a softer metal which holds the intaglio (impression). Held in a mould, the die can then cast as many 'sorts' as desired, the letters being made from a metal which fuses at a low temperature, tin for instance or lead. The letters appear in relief as on the original punch. The pioneers benefited from the experience of goldsmiths and engravers of medallions as well as the moneyers, who were often, anyway, recruited from the ranks of the goldsmiths. They knew already how to make the blind stamps which were used to ornament the leather covers of books. From the 1 3th century metal founders had known how to employ punches engraved in relief to produce the clay moulds from whose hollow matrices they made the relief inscriptions on crests. Pewter makers were using brass die-stamps from the i4th century, and for a long time die-stamps had been used to strike coins, medals and seals. Although coins and medals were normally made by inserting a thin strip of metal between dies struck by a hammer, they also knew how to obtain this effect by casting metal in a mould, and this latter method, favoured in antiquity, came back into favour at the end of the i4th

from the beginning of the i5th century, the techniques of casting from moulds, whether metal, or a mixture of fine sand and clay, and that of die stamping were both known. It was also known how to combine the two techniques by first punching out a matrix and then casting metal

which they were beginning to work. Almost as sparse, more explicit, are the hints to be gleaned from contemporary chroniclers. As for the examination of the earliest printed books which have come down to us, although this may support some hypotheses, it can tell us nothing definite about production processes. Most such books, in any case, seem to have been printed when the invention had already been perfected, and was being applied on a commercial scale. Firstly the archives. Pride of place must go to a number of cryptic documents relating to the famous lawsuit which took place at Stras7 bourg in 1439.

J4 In the face of such vagueness and difficulties of interpretation we are reduced to what are sometimes very tenuous hypotheses about early

attempts at printing in Holland. We get no nearer to a solution by looking at the books since no evidence of actual techniques used can be found

by examining them. One fact, however, deserves to be noted: there exists a whole series of undated printed books, very probably of Dutch

printed at Mainz, but it is still possible that the method used derived from an earlier one than that employed at Mainz. 77

The crucial question relates to the actual making What kind of punches did they use in their first trials?

Were the matrices always of metal or did they use clay and fine sand to make their moulds at the beginning ? If so, did they use wooden punches ? Did they not make moulds of lead by melting lead around a metal or wooden punch, and would they not end up with letters of lead or some metal if the medium used was a lead mould? Did they turn out the
matrices and printing-blocks for whole pages at a time? One thing is sure about the early craftsmen that they were feeling their way forward
:

by slow degrees for a long time before they found the answer. And another fact seems certain that the men at work on this were numerous - Coster (if he did exist) in Holland, Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer in Mainz, Waldvogel at Avignon, all were trying to perfect the process, to reproduce texts by mechanical means.

Mainz was without any doubt the cradle of the first printing industry its evolution is linked with three names Gutenberg, the man named in the Strasbourg legal suit, Johann Fust, a rich citizen who was his financier, and Peter Schoeffer, a former student of the University of Paris who was probably a copyist and a calligrapher before turning

another agreement by which the expenses incurred in buying paper,

parchment and ink were guaranteed. All this suggests that Gutenberg was on the brink of success in his work, if he had not already succeeded. But in 145 5 there was a dramatic turn of events. Fust accused Gutenberg
of not keeping to his agreement, and took him to court, where he was ordered to pay the interest due and return the capital not yet spent. 78 Two
years later, on the i4th October 1457, the first work which can be dated came from the press, the Mainz Psalter, the work of Fust and his new

The only objection to this theory, which must at least modify it, is that the oldest types surviving, which were made in Lyons at the end of 1 5 th or early in the 1 6th century, and have been studied by M. Audin, prove under spectrographic analysis to contain tin, lead and antimony, with sometimes a speck of silver or iron. 8 * If an alloy of this sort wore more quickly

in the

with

printing. They travelled from workshop to workshop, hiring their services out to masters who wanted to top up their stocks of letters or to

refurbish them. But punches and matrices remained the property of each workshop and this explains the rich diversity of type founts found in incunabula. The designing and cutting of type took up a great deal of
time, so that printers would use the new letters as they were cast and mix them with older characters which were only gradually replaced. Further-

more the production of new type cost a lot of money and when the chance came printers would buy material which came on to the market after a death or a bankruptcy. This happened only rarely. But they could ask a richer fellow tradesman to sell them some founts, or better still to let them have matrices from which they could turn out their own type. From the last quarter of the i5th century printers seem to have been
ready to engage in this kind of deal, though at first perhaps only reluctantly, altering some of the capitals each time, which they had re-engraved so as to differentiate between the work of each establishment.

of trouble to the early printers. The 'height to paper' (i.e. the total height of each sort), which is today fixed by official regulations, was variable;

Composition and Impression

work of the punch cutter and of the type founder. His craft may be divided into two parts, composition and printing. Composition is the process by which type is assembled into pages and groups of pages in

'composed') the compositor places it in a 'galley', a small tray in which the lines of type are held, with a 'lead' between each line (the leads are
small lead pieces which do not register and which keep the lines apart). He then groups the lines into pages and assembles the pages in the forme

where they are secured with wooden wedges and firmly tied together. The compositor has to master a series of movements, carrying them out adroitly and with such speed and accuracy that each of his movements becomes automatic. This type of manual rhythm had not previously
been required in the manufacturing processes of the ijth century. It prompts the question, how far did the need to increase output impel printers between the i5th and i8th centuries to find methods which

would enable these operations to be carried out as efficiently as possible ? 89

Two observations should quickly be made. Firstly, the earliest compositheir modern counterparts. done today the compositor stands before a sloping case with his freedom to move unimpeded. In the i5th century (and even in the i6th) this was not so, as a picture in the Printers' Dance of Death (Matthew Husz, Lyons, 1499) shows: the compositor sits at a very low case, which is only slightly tilted and is mounted on a trestle.

used in different countries will vary according to the language of the
country, just as the letters on typewriters do. How were the sorts distributed ? Were the letters arranged in a different way in each country as happens today ? Or did Latin favour uniformity,

and, if so, when did the differentiation between the cases of different countries begin? Unfortunately such questions are almost impossible to answer, since no documents containing precise information on this

subject survive from before the end of the zyth century. If we recall that, owing to the habit of engraving letters ligatured together and founded in the same type, and owing to the many abbreviations used in the i jth

Hence principles which seem to us to be self-evident, letters, must sooner or later have been adopted. Yet no strict rules seem to have come into being for several centuries although such rules would have served to make the compositor's work easier and to help him acquire those automatic reflexes whose necessity we have stressed.

were displaced, and this seems to point to a very old tradition. In the bottom left hand side of the upper case and in the lower case, the lower case letters were stored, as they are today, in pigeon holes of varying size depending on how frequently the letters they contained were used. This layout, with a few notable exceptions, is like the one given in Momoro's Traite elementaire de I'imprimerie (1793) and in the Encyclopedia91 (where, however, the plan of a case and the elevated drawing which accompanies it do not agree in their representation of the lower case).

was important

that the paper

-

particularly the margins

- was not

splashed with ink at the moment of printing. There was a risk that the ink would spread beyond the inked areas on the forme. So a protecting sheet of paper or parchment was used which exposed only those parts

of the forme which held the type. Further, whatever the quality of the characters or the care spent on their precise justification (i.e. the alignment of each line of type) the letters would not all stand at exactly the

same height. If the sheet were placed directly in contact with the platen, letters which were slightly below the others would be badly printed, and others would leave either too much or too little impression on the paper. To overcome this and to introduce a bit of give into the surface of the platen, either a sheet of felt or several sheets of paper needed to be inserted between the sheet to be printed and the platen.
These different problems led the printers to use the system of the frisket and tympan. The 'tympan' is a double frame (large and small tympan) secured to the press by hinges. The bed and the forme are placed within

Whatever the truth, the first presses must have been primitive. The books were printed a page at a time, even in quarto, and the formes were always page size. 97 Despite all the care bestowed on them, the lines of print on the pages which were printed in succession on one side of the sheet could not be at exactly the same height from one page to another and the appearance of the books often suffers as a result. After 1470 this
inconvenience tends to disappear. It seems that the technique of the double pull on the press bar started at this time. The forme is from

same size as the sheet. But for this to be possible the forme, now mounted on a mobile carriage, had to be capable of rapid and precise movement. Very quickly, before the end of the 1 5th century, a system of cranks and
pullies

was used to bring about this horizontal movement. For a long time printers were content to slide the carriage over the level surface of a

These were not the only improvements made between the 1 5th and i8th centuries. 98 Printers did not seek to modify the basic principle of the press but simply improved on detail. In the i6th century they replaced
the

thread with a metal one and reinforced the parts

subjected to pressure in order to make the press sturdier. These improvements are visible in wood-cuts of the period and in printers' marks which

modifications to the press. To make it stronger he reinforced some its construction and put in a spring called the 'yoke' to make the platen give a more even impression. The 'Dutch' press gradually

Countries, which quickly earned a reputation for

high quality work, and then in England, but was never adopted in France, which continued to use the old classic Lyons press. Thus between the 1 6th and i8th centuries the traditional double action press was only

made by folding the sheets of paper once, and so four pages on each sheet, two on each side. In a quarto book the sheets are folded twice and consist of eight pages, four on each side in an octavo book the sheets are folded three times and contain 16 pages, eight on each side, and so on. When folded the sheets should comprise a quire which would be made up of four pages in a folio, eight in a quarto, sixteen in an octavo. But often the need to give greater strength to the quires (sections) of folios and quartos make it necessary to insert two sheets at once, so doubling the bulk (and at the same time the number of pages) of each quire. On the other hand in the smaller formats (i6mo, 24mo, 321110) quires made from a single sheet would be too thick and so printers make several quires from the pages printed on a single sheet: for i6mos they cut the sheet in two and make two quires of 8 leaves, that is 1 6 pages.

technique because of the custom of printing books page by page on a small forme (smaller than the sheet of paper) which at first encouraged

them to cut the sheet before printing, although this made the whole operation longer. Moreover paper varied, coming generally in two sizes regalis (about 70 cm x 50 cm) and median (about 50 cm x 30 cm) and
printers often used half sheets of regalis along with whole sheets of median so that in the same work some sheets would be printed as if for a folio volume, others as if for a quarto volume. Finally, the quires generally

The Chinese Precedent*

We know

that

by inventing paper the Chinese indirectly contributed to

the discovery of printing in Europe. 103 Nothing discovered so far suggests that we owe China any more than that, despite the fact that for

nearly five hundred years before Gutenberg the Chinese knew how to print with moveable characters. country in which scholars have had a uniquely influential role in

A

China more than anywhere else venerated learning as a welllife, and her vast literature has grown richer from age to age. The most ancient written records indicate that the book was in
spring of

existence as early as the Chang dynasty (1765-1 123 B.C.). On fragments of bone and on the scales of tortoise shells, which were split with redhot pokers for purposes of divination, nearly 2,500 different characters

have been made out, the ancestors of the 80,000 characters of today.

rod, which was decorated at either end, and the Chinese name for a book meant 'roll' (as did the Latin

The most

ancient paper that has survived also

comes from Central

Asia: seven letters written in Sogdian on sheets carefully folded and bearing the address to which they were to be sent. Sir Aurel Stein dis-

covered them in the ruins of a tower on the Great Wall abandoned by the
Chinese army in the mid-2nd century A.D. 106 Microscopic analysis by Professor J. von Wiesner has revealed that the paste was made solely

from cloth of hemp, bits of which are still intact. 107 We know for certain that the paper was made in China and, as it was used by foreigners far from the centres of production, this proves that the new discovery must have spread rapidly. Paper thus replaced silk, except for luxury manuscripts. Sheets of small size, about 25 cmX45 cm, were glued end to end to form long strips which could be rolled or unrolled and were attached
to a supporting rod.

was the source of nearly 1 5,000 manuscripts dating from the jth century to the end of the loth, now divided between the British Museum, the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Peking National Library. For the most part they are rolls of paper but there are also to be found among them the different forms of book which the invention of printing was destined
to modify.
It was probably the need to find a particular passage in a text straightaway, without having to unroll yards of paper, combined with a pious wish to emulate the sacred books of India which are written on long, narrow palm leaves bound together with fine twine, as well as the task of

which the pages could be turned backward or forward at will. So quickly was this type of book adopted into general use that the Arab writer Mohammed Ibn Ishaq remarked in 989: 'The Chinese write their religious books and their works of scholarship on sheets of paper which open like a fan'. This type of book, in form half Indian, half Chinese, has continued to be used for Buddhist and Taoist texts, for collections of prints, paintings, and examples of calligraphy. But, unsupported, the paper tore easily, and the next advance was to fold each sheet in half down the centre, the leaves
'whirling book' to describe the rapidity with

being bound together along the fold yet remaining free to flutter like wings, hence the name 'butterfly book'. This type of book, the equivalent of our own, was perfect for carrying a manuscript text, but it was only
possible to print a text, using the technique of rubbing the sheet

a

block which had been engraved in relief and inked, on one side of the leaf. So, to hide the blank verso they began to fold the leaves in two and

sew them together, not along the folds, but along the edges. The fine pliable paper used in China, Korea and Japan was well adapted to this method of binding which has hardly changed even today. A paper or silk cover protected each quire which often corresponded to a chapter. These were assembled six or eight at a time and secured between thin sheets of

By the beginning

of our era, seals engraved in relief were common, and the pious had them engraved with lengthy religious texts; soon such prayers were added to the large portraits of Buddha or the bodhisattvas which were

produced to adorn monks' cells or the rooms of pious laymen. The engravers' skill became greater and greater; moreover impressions of
high quality could be made on paper while this technique was of no use on silk. As in the West, so in China, once a suitable medium had been found experiments multiplied, and the engravers tried bolder enterprises. Tracts were soon being produced as well as prayers, and they were in turn followed by short devotional works and by popular texts calendars

was already well advanced. It required a century, at least, to overcome the opposition of the scholars who thought it sacrilegious to use such a process for printing classical texts and who seem to have feared that their
trade as copyists would be threatened. Originally a craft confined to the upper

and lower reaches of the Yellow River, block-printing was eventually adopted by the scholars to preserve and disseminate the canonical writings. As such it was

recommended officially by a government minister, Feng Tao, in a report to the Emperor. Like Tsai Lun's, this report has survived. These two men are still credited with the honour of inventions which they did no
more than bring
to the notice of the Court. Feng Tao proposed, in 932 A.D., to preserve the classical texts by block-printing as a last resort because the dynasty in power did not have the financial means to undertake the engraving of a series of 'Classics

been possible in more prosperous times. The success of this project, which took from 932 to 95 3, sanctified the new art, and little by little all the existing literature was put into print. Attempts were quickly made
to

improve on the newly adopted method, but copper engraving and experiments with moveable letters were not successful.

from being innovators, took extreme care to produce exact imitations. 110 The 42-line Bible for example was printed in a letter-type which faithfully reproduced the handwriting of the Rhenish missals.

Any such deceit would be easily spotted because a ijth-century would be more acute in detecting such things than our eyes and eye would have quickly distinguished a manuscript from a printed book despite all the resemblances. Besides, people soon came to prefer printed texts which were more readable and accurate than the older manuscripts. Resistance from copyists and stationers? Certainly. But we must not forget that most of them were subject to strict university control and were not strictly speaking members of an autonomous
corporate body. Consequently they were under university authority which was favourably disposed to printing in its early days, so that the

from the medieval texts which they derided as 'gothic' - the term also used contemptuously by Alberti to describe the ornamentation of traditional architecture.

Soon, roman spread through Italy as copyists used it in the scriptoria of Naples, Rome and, in particular, Florence. Collectors who included princes, bishops, abbots, cardinals, bankers and rich merchants bought

Wishing to reach the widest possible clientele printers naturally began by using traditional types. But already in Italy roman was in regular use and there were many book lovers who wanted to possess texts in the alphabet inspired by antiquity, which were still relatively rare in manuscripts.

Many

of these 'amateurs' financed or encouraged the establish-

ment of printing shops so that printing very quickly publicised the script which Petrarch and his like had made fashionable. Sweynheym and Pannartz, who worked at Subiaco and then in Rome and were the first printers to set up in Italy, began with a semi-roman letter and later a more characteristic roman (1465-1467). From around this time Adolf Rusch, a Strasbourg printer, also possessed a roman script which he had used for his edition of Rabanus Maurus's Encyclopaedia before 1467. In
1469 the German Johannes da Spira in Venice employed a similar script for an edition of Cicero's Epistolae adfamiliares, and, while Gering used a type like that of Sweynheym and Pannartz, Nicolas Jenson in Venice

Fleming Lambert Palmart began by printing the works of Fenollar in Valencia in roman script, but his example was scarcely followed. Most workshops equipped themselves with gothic the bastarda form was the favourite to print for example Villon's Grant Testament, the farce de Pathelin, romances of chivalry, chronicles and popular tales in French, Shepherds' Calendars, and the Ars Moriendi. The large form of gothic also came in, for the works of Ockham, Nicholas de Lyra and the many commentaries of Peter Lombard. Gradually, the fashion for humanist scripts, and the wide diffusion of Italian editions in which roman was used, made its victory inevitable, soon followed by that of its associated fount, italic. Venice played a big part in the eventual domination of roman and italic. There Aldus had his roman cut which exercised an enormous influence over 16th-century type

Following the Venetian example, Amerbach (who was trained in Venice) and, after him, Froben increasingly adopted roman and italic, spreading their use into Germany and encouraging it in France. In Lyons, the
Venetian type was quickly copied, and Balthasar de Gabiano and Barthelemy Trot made imitations of Aldine italic. In Paris, Joost Bade

and Henri Estienne spread the use of roman, and between 1530 and 1 540 a whole series of romans were used by Robert Estienne, Simon de

These scripts, more perfect than those which had inspired them, rapidly became standard throughout Europe.

name of the

author.

However, from the i5th century another element appeared, an identifying sign called the printer's mark made with a wood-cut and included with either incipit or colophon. At first it was often simply an outline of the mark printers placed on consignments of books they were

around 1530, the time of the triumph of humanism, more and more new books were to be found with short titles accompanied by only the name of the author and, at the bottom of the page, the publisher's address. Thus, at the same time as roman and italic script began to prevail, the

The replacement of the wood-cut by copper engraving brought new changes in the title page at the end of the i6th century. The title pages of most books looked the same, but it became noticeable, first of all in
the large and carefully prepared folio editions, and subsequently in volumes of all kinds, that the technique of the framed title page was
into favour. Originally the title was often placed in the centre of an engraved frame. But this method called for a delicate

happily with the elegant thin lines of the engraving. So a technique was soon devised whereby both title and decoration were engraved on the

The move towards a simpler, more uniform product was equally apparent
in the appearance of the text.

It was impossible to cite page referdo habitually nowadays, because the leaf signature or the on which the page passage was to be found would vary with each hence the manuscript chapter number or its heading had to be quoted and even the paragraph, and the text often had to be arranged by subparagraphs for ease of reference. Again, books were written in a crabbed hand, full of contractions because of the need to economise with expensive vellum, so that as much as possible was crammed on to a page, with no space between paragraphs or chapters, no headings or page layout. It is easy to see therefore why manuscripts were difficult both to decipher and to consult. The first printed books were, as we have seen, exactly like manuscripts, with the same general arrangement, the same abbreviations and the same crabbed writing. Gradually, the lines became more spacious, the script became bigger and the abbreviations less numerous. But the

more traditional readers drawn from the clergy, students and the upper classes, the bourgeoisie began to form their own libraries. Quarto and octavo books, though common enough in the 1 5th century, were only for short texts too slight to publish in folio. Books intended for the pulpit were of large format. In fact the main books which systematically used small formats in this period were devotional works, especially Books of Hours. For these books, which were in constant use and already intended for a large market, had to be easily transportable. Another literature produced in small format and intended for an even larger market, was that of popular tales, known from their shape as 'plaquettes gothiques'. But from the end of the ijth century, anxious to ease the reading of classical authors, the Aldi launched their famous 'portable' collection. Taken up by the small humanist readership, this format was adopted

If the old romances of chivalry to format, easy continued to appear in folio and quarto, the Latin poems of the humanists, the works of Marot, of Rabelais and of Marguerite of Navarre and the groups of poets known as the Pleiade all came out in small format. It was in this form that Erasmus' Adages spread through Europe, and this too was the form used for the innumerable pamphlets in which Luther and the reformers diffused their ideas. Books with illustrations were often like this as well. Holbein in 1 540 drew little vignettes for a 4 and 8vo edition of Images de la Bible and Simulacres de la Mart which had an enormous success. 129 De Tournes at Lyons and Denis Janot in Paris and printers elsewhere published editions of figures de la Bible and the Emblems of Alciat or Ovid's Metamorphoses. ^ For students and scholars however the folio was still preferred, since although it was more difficult to handle, it was more legible and it was an easier form in which

But the method was too costly and time-consuming, except perhaps for a few dedicatory copies printed on vellum for important people.

Mechanical reproduction of texts meant a corresponding method of reproducing pictures.

printers quickly began to illustrate popular books with wood-cuts and, once the technique was perfected, books of all kinds. Printers from the

Rhine Valley also took blocks with them when they left home to work elsewhere, or cut new blocks themselves for the books they printed.
Thus, the first illustrated books printed all over Europe had a clearly Germanic stamp. In 1467, for example, two years after the appearance of the first printed book in Italy, two German printers in Rome, Sweynheym and Pannartz, published an illustrated edition of Torquemada's

book from Naples, a Boccaccio (1478), was printed by a German called Riessinger with wood-cut illustrations that again appear to be by one of his compatriots. Germanic influence also made itself strongly felt at Venice where so many German printers were in business. The first illustrated book in France that we know of was the Mirouer de la Redemption de I'humain lignaige, printed in Lyons. It was the work of a German, one Matthew Husz, using cuts already used at Cologne in 1474 and at Basel in 1476. At Louvain, Brussels, Bruges, Gouda and Antwerp the style of illustration was again inspired by the Cologne school. Later on German influence is evident in the first illustrated English and Spanish
books.

Everywhere, then, at the beginning, the German influence was predominant, but soon local trends began to emerge and with them the first regional schools. In a few rare instances the cuts may have been made

by local artists, possibly playing-card makers not particularly influenced by German models. There is nothing specifically German about the pictures in the first book from Verona, the De re militari of Valturius

grow up, often influenced by local styles of painting and illumination, and by the monumental architecture under their eyes. Each regional
school acquired its own manner, its personal language, and began to specialise. In Florence, for example, printers above all illustrated popular

books designed for a local clientele. In the big commercial cities like Venice and Lyons on the other hand, printing was largely for export,
and printers concentrated on illustrated Bibles and Church books. Lyons also issued popular books and moral tracts, devotional works, and, for a smaller public, translations of the Latin authors best known
to the readers of the time, Terence and Ovid, with pictures of the characters. In Paris illustrated books to suit all tastes were published:

Books of Hours, devotional works, Villon's poetry, farces like those of Pathelin, Church books, histories and chivalric romances. At Gouda, Gerard de Leeu, the premier publisher of illustrated books in the Low Countries, also produced devotional works and romances for the rich merchants of that country. At Nuremberg, Anton Koberger, primarily
a publisher of learned works, produced outstanding illustrated books and employed Wolgemut, the wood engraver, to illustrate the Schat^ebehalter with 91 full-page pictures representing scenes from the Bible

Given these circumstances it is easily seen how complex the study of illustrations can be. Even though a minor art, book illustration must be seen as part of the great artistic, intellectual and social movements of its age. But that is not our object, for such a study would require a full volume on its own. One thing that is clear is the importance of illustrations, whether in xylographs or printed books, in the diffusion of iconographic themes. In this context, Emile Male has demonstrated the
influence of the Biblia pauperum and the Speculum humanae salvationis. Already the miniaturist who illuminated the Tres riches heures of the Due

de Berry used a manuscript of the Speculum humanae salvationis. Van Eyck and Van der Weyden in 1460 owned copies of this manuscript

Rheims were influenced by the same two works, as was a and another in Chalon-sur-Saone. The two great stained glass windows in the Sainte Chapelle of Vic-le-Comte are also copied from the Biblia pauperum and the Speculum. Likewise some sculptures in the main doorway in the church of St. Maurice at Vienne in Dauphine, and the great doorway of the cathedral of Troyes. The same influence can be detected in Limousin enamels and ivory coffers. Similar examples are by no means rare scenes from Books of Hours often influenced the makers of tapestry and glass. Shepherds' Calendars and the Dance of Death (Dame macabre) together with the Books of Hours were also models for mural painters; hence the murals at La FerteLoupiere and Meslay-le-Grenet, inspired by the Dance of Death printed by Guy Marchant and by Coustiau and Menard. On the other hand Marchant's Dance of Death was probably a copy of one in the Cimetiere

Venice.
In France, however, the plain decorative frames taken from Italian models by Geoffrey Tory enjoyed a great vogue and were imitated everywhere. Soon Kerver at Paris re-edited the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, illustrated

by plates inspired by Italian wood-cuts, and this work which had had only a limited success in Venice in 1500, caught on in Paris from 1 5 49. But it was the mathematician, Oronce Fine, whose work had led him to take an interest in book illustration, who established the

However, one whole section of the

groups who scarcely knew how to read, seem, for a long time afterwards, to have remained faithful to the old form of illustration. This public,

whose taste scarcely changed, was served by the poorer printers and the smaller publishers who for a long time stayed loyal to the old gothic types and, for an even longer time, to 1 5 th and early 1 6th-century
wood-cuts which they re-bought, used until they wore out and then had re-engraved without any modification. It was undoubtedly because of
the importance of this public that from around 1570 there was a noticeable renewal in the fashion for collections and series of popular

The work of the engravers seems careless and hurried, and they tend more and more just to turn out poor copies of earlier illustrations. Fewer pictures were published and when publishing revived at the end of the century wood is no longer the medium, but copper. This was a change in technique which represented a new intellectual climate and we must consider its implications. Copperplate engraving was already well known since the 1 5th century and had been perfected (like printing) by goldsmiths.

Soon, despite the technical difficulties, copper was increasingly used in book illustration. At first it was used only in exceptional cases to illustrate technical works or volumes studded with portraits, but gradually it extended to books of all kinds. 141 The decisive impetus came from Antwerp, a town with a great many painters, where Hieronymus Cock, a successful printseller, controlled a workshop in which the young Bruegel learnt the use of the burin. Plantin was in daily contact with Cock and his workers and began to have some of his books illustrated with copper plate engravings by the artists in

long reign of more than 200 years, and this was no merely technical change. The technique triumphed because of its powers of minutely accurate representation. As a means of communication conveying a

image and a permanent record it was unrivalled. The print became increasingly analogous in its diffusion of pictorial fact to the book in its diffusion of typographic fact. Thus the adoption of copper and the international trade in prints at the end of the i6th and beginning of the 1 7th centuries helped to widen men's horizons. We need only mention as an example the monumental collection of travels by Thomas de Bry in the early 1 7th century which imparted a sometimes erroneous but always precise idea of the world, from Lapland to Brazil, through

Bosse provided a precise portrayal of the life of the Parisian bourgeoisie, and Nanteuil and his competitors produced numerous portraits of
princes and of merchants in the second half of the iyth century. In the 1 8th century the engravers of the French school set out to portray manners and morals, illustrating the daily life of the aristocracy and the

bourgeoisie, and the street-life of Paris.

The print also played its critical part in the diffusion of works of art. From the iyth century, thanks to the engraving, most people were
acquainted with the masterpieces of art scattered throughout Europe. A host of engravers from every country devoted themselves to reproducing the paintings, monuments, and ruins of Italy. Engravers were
often also<:ommissioned to reproduce the paintings of the great masters of their native country in their own day. Nanteuil and Morin, for example, produced prints after the portraits of Philippe de Champaigne

when illustrated books had been destined for a vast public. The new 1 8th century demand was in the luxury market and came from the aristocracy
of wealth, bankers and financiers who, proud of their recently acquired fortunes, wished to start a library of their own. Having no inclination for
serious works which bored them, they turned bibliophiles with a taste for sumptuously decorated books. It was an age when rich tax farmers had magnificently illustrated editions made of the Fables and Contes of

To take an actual example - the books in the old Bibliotheque Royale, now the Bibliotheque Nationale, were bound in the iyth century with red morocco using gold tooling, and emblazoned with the royal arms. Today most books received by the Bibliotheque Nationale are only bound in cloth. There is no reason to be surprised by this care for solidity, and the quality of materials used in binding, which arouses admiration in the trade today. At that time a manuscript or its successor, a printed book, was so comparatively rare and costly an item of merchandise that it merited care in its preservation and adornment. From the invention of

printing right up to the 1 8th century, although the readership increased, the book was still the preserve of a small and favoured elite. In days when paper was made by hand and books printed on hand presses, the book

Confronted by the incessant increase of books, binders, always on the lookout for a more rapid method which would economise labour and
reduce the cost of their products, developed a different technique, that of the roulette. The roulette was a tiny metal wheel, on which was
a simple, repeatable motif. By this means it became possible to decorate bindings with a series of rapidly executed headbands. Sometimes the plate system and the roulette system were used simul-

the course of the i6th century book production increased, editions proliferated and the book reached a larger public, binders sought tech-

bindings. While the art of luxury binding enjoyed a boom in the middle of the i6th century and then again in the 1 8th century, the average book,

although durably bound, no longer had any cover decoration. Since

books were now stored upright and pushed up closely against one another to save space, only the spine which was to be seen on the shelves of libraries bore any tooling: usually some decorative motifs and a

The Immortal Witness

Be a scribe! Engrave this in your heart So that your name might live on like theirs! The scroll is better than the carved stone. A man has died: his corpse is dust, And his people have passed from the land. It is a book which makes him remembered In the mouth of the speaker who reads him.1

`In the mouth of the speaker who reads him', intoned the Egyptian scribe who, about 1300 BC, appreciated that `to read' meant `to recite'. For most of written history, reading was speaking. People had earlier realized that verbal instructions, agreements and tallies could easily be garbled, disputed or forgotten. A special witness had been needed, an `immortal witness', who could recall aloud amounts and commodities without error, who could be questioned at any time to confirm facts verbally and stop disputes. And so writing was born, at first blush the human voice turned to stone. When city-states expanded into kingdoms, demands on writing increased exponentially, necessitating ever more complex forms of written documentation ­ each time intended to be read aloud. Reading has always been different from writing. Writing prioritizes sound, as the spoken word must be transformed or deconstructed into representative sign(s). Reading, however, prioritizes meaning.2 The faculty of reading has, in fact, very little to do with the skill of writing. What is reading, then? The answer is not simple, as the act of reading is variable, not absolute. In its most general modern definition, reading is of course the ability to make sense of written or printed symbols. The reader `uses the symbols to guide the recovery of information from his or her memory and
11

subsequently uses this information to construct a plausible interpretation of the writer's message'.3 But reading has not always been this. Initially it was the simple faculty of extracting visual information from any encoded system and comprehending the respective meaning. Later it came to signify almost exclusively the comprehending of a continuous text of written signs on an inscribed surface. More recently it has included the extracting of encoded information from an electronic screen. And reading's definition will doubtless continue to expand in future for, as with any faculty, it is also a measure of humanity's own advancement. Just like our five senses, reading involves something wonderfully unique, as the following paradox will illustrate.4 Jones has taught himself to read Greek letters, but hasn't learnt Greek yet. Andropolis grew up speaking Greek, but has never learnt Greek letters. One day Andropolis gets a letter from Greece, and has Jones read it to him. Jones can voice the letters, but cannot understand; Andropolis can understand, but cannot voice the letters. Who, then, is actually reading? The answer: both together. Reading is not merely the attaching of sound to grapheme, which occurs only at an elementary level. Meaning is involved, and in a fundamental way. At a higher level of perception reading can even convey meaning alone, without any recourse to sound. Therein lies reading's sense-like magic. The multiple processes of reading, as the eminent British linguist Roy Harris has affirmed, `must inevitably be relative to particular cultural purposes, and depend on the contrasting modes of oral rendition which a particular culture may have institutionalized'.5 Hence, what we judge to be `reading' in the past is usually an arbitrary comparison based on what reading means to us today. Such a retrospective judgement is invalid, because throughout history reading has been many different things to many peoples. Its origins are ancient. Reading appears to be superficially and parasitically coupled to such primeval cognitive scanning processes as tracking, weaving, tool-making, berry gathering, face and gender recognition and many others, whereby a flood of visual data ­ shapes, units, patterns, orientation, sequencing ­ is assessed at a glance.
12 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Specialists in communications recognize five phases of information exchange: production, transmission, reception, storage and repetition. When writing is present in a society, these five occur either aurally (one is read to), as in spoken discourse, or visually, incorporating the sense of sight (or, with the blind, touch). Reading is frequently a synæsthetic process: that is, it often combines the two senses of hearing and sight. However, most significantly, hearing is habitually bypassed, leaving reading reliant only on sight (or touch). Consequently, two conflicting theories of reading obtain. The first, supported by those who believe reading to be an exclusively linguistic process, sees reading as a phonological (relating to the sound system of a language) linear process that occurs letter by letter, linking language's elements into ever larger comprehensible units, until first utterance and then understanding are achieved. The second theory, endorsed by those who hold reading to be a visual semantic process, maintains that the grapheme or graphic form ­ whether logogram (word sign), syllabogram (syllabic sign) or a combination of letters (signs in an alphabetic system) ­ yields meaning without necessary recourse to language. Whole words and phrases, even short sentences, can be read `at one go', the proponents of this theory maintain; one doesn't have to deconstruct them into individually sounded-out letters. Yet both theories are correct, in that each obtains at a different level of reading competence and/or activity. That is, elementary reading is indeed a phonological linear process, whereas fluent reading is a visual semantic process. Others have argued that early historical reading in particular was `a matter of hearing the cuneiform, that is, hallucinating the speech from looking at its picture-symbols, rather than visual reading of syllables in our sense.'6 This theory of `aural hallucinating', however, defies both laboratory evidence and the known history of writing: both `ear' and `eye' demand equal acknowledgement in any responsible theory of early reading. This is because the act is in reality a highly complex, multi-level, cerebral process requiring fundamentals and higher-order units simultaneously. Learning to read appears to be a separate activity from fluent reading, to be sure. But as fluent reading frequently
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 13

requires recourse to learning stratagems ­ when reading an unfamiliar or foreign word, or a different hand, type, script or even entire writing system ­ so, too, does learning to read require recourse to advanced visual stratagems in turn, in order to internalize patterns. In this way, two different types of reading have apparently always obtained: literal or mediate reading (learning), and visual or immediate reading (fluent). Everyone begins with mediate reading, putting sound to sign. Most learners then progress to immediate reading, putting sense to sign directly, then advance to larger sign groupings (phrases or even short sentences). After several exposures to a word or sign-combination, a reader comes to form a direct pathway between sign and sense, bypassing sound altogether. Only this explains most of what we find with fluent adult reading. Frequent readers always become fluent readers, who then minimize sound and maximize sense. For want of longer texts and a reading audience, reading as we know it today did not exist before classical antiquity. The earliest readers sighted the notched stick or the dictated tally, the oral made visible. Very few people had cause to learn to read: only those who wished to verify an account, check a label or identify an owner's mark. In time, scribe-reciters intoned dockets, letters, legal documents, pæans and dedications. Antiquity's great clay and papyrus archives eventually appeared, though first and foremost to oversee and authenticate accounts and contracts and to prompt the memory of those who recalled the greater oral story. During its first three millennia, the `immortal witness' was the spoken word incarnate.

the first readers
The further one looks back into the past, the more difficult reading becomes.7 Primitive recording systems comprised codes known only to a small group of practitioners. For the most part, ancient `literature' conveyed only what could be learnt by heart. Reading and writing did not exist as
14 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

autonomous domains of activity. They were minimal appendages to speech. Ambiguity abounded. Decoding of mnemonics (memory aids) and graphics (pictorial displays) can also be regarded as `reading', albeit in a primitive sense.8 Both Neandertals and early Homo sapiens sapiens read notches on bones signalling something that was meaningful to them ­ perhaps a tally of game, days or lunar cycles. Cave art was `read', too, as graphic stories bearing meaningful information. Primitive tribes read lengthy picture messages on bark or leather that could convey great detail. In many earlier societies tally sticks were read to learn amounts. Signalling allowed symbolic messages to be read over a distance: flags, smoke, fired powders, reflections from polished metals and other devices. The Incas read the colour-coded quipus knots to keep track of complicated mercantile transactions. Ancient Polynesians read string and notch records in order to chant their generations. All such `readings' involved predetermined codes. They conveyed a known significance ­ whether an action (as in cave art), numerical value (as in tallies and knots) or spoken name (as in notches and strings) ­ without fulfilling, however, the criteria for complete writing. In its most general sense, writing is the `sequencing of standardized symbols (characters, signs or sign components) in order to graphically reproduce human speech, thought and other things in part or whole.'9 Because this is a limiting definition of something that defies limitation, the wonder of writing, it might be preferable to use `complete writing' instead as a working model, understanding this to comprise the fulfilment of three specific criteria:
· Complete writing must have as its purpose communication; · Complete writing must consist of artificial graphic marks on a durable or electronic surface; · Complete writing must use marks that relate conventionally to articulate speech (the systematic arrangement of significant vocal sounds) or electronic programming in such a way that communication is achieved.

t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 15

Complete writing was a long time coming. For thousands of years, people used indexical symbols to record quantities: five pebbles for five sheep, for example, with each pebble `read' as one sheep. As early as ten thousand years ago, the Azilian people of France were painting crosses, stripes and other designs on pebbles to be read as a code for something, the meaning now lost. Small clay tokens or counters of various geometrical shapes, bearing lines, crosses, circles and other designs, were read for some eight thousand years in the Middle East in a rudimentary bookkeeping system, each token representing one of the given commodity, its design identifying its kind. In time, such chit-like counters in Mesopotamia were being enclosed in special clay `envelopes' called bullæ, the outside of which bore the same token design to identify, at a glance, commodity; it also held a sequence of dots or lines to signal amount. Eventually, clay tablets conveyed similar bookkeeping, also using readily identifiable graphic symbols to represent these and other things. Over time, the pictograms became standardized and abstract, but retained their phonetic value. A paradigm shift occurred when Sumerian scribes began using systemic phoneticism: that is, they systematically coordinated sounds and symbols (including pictograms) to create `signs' of a writing system. A design no longer signified a real commodity, like a sheep, but stood for a specific sound value instead. It was Sumer's conscious exploitation of the phonographic in the pictographic that turned incomplete writing into complete writing. Reading in its true form emerged when one started to interpret a sign for its sound value alone within a standardized system of limited signs. Whole texts, and not just isolated words, could now be conveyed, meaning that reading was no longer a one-to-one transfer (object to word), but a logical sequencing of sounds to recreate a natural human language. Rather than reading pictures, one now read language. The three criteria for complete writing were now fulfilled. Sign became sound ­ freed from its system-external referent ­ in Mesopotamia between 6,000 and 5,700 years ago. The idea soon spread, west to the Nile and east to the Iranian Plateau and even to the Indus, where different languages and different social
16 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

needs demanded other graphic expressions. Everywhere, writing was recognized to be an invaluable tool for accumulating and storing information: it facilitated accounting, material storage and transport, and it retained names, dates and places better than human memory ever could. All early `reading' involved very simple code recognition, and was invariably task-orientated.

mesopotamia
Reading long remained a very primitive tool in Mesopotamia. The world's first active readers sighted only a bare skeleton of text (name, commodity, amount), the control of which served to empower an oligarchy. Sumerian writing developed `not to reproduce a pre-existent spoken discourse but to commit to memory concrete bits of information'.10 This soon led to classifying reality in useful lists made up of nouns (proper names and commodities), adjectives (qualities), verbs (actions) and numbers arranged in easily comprehensible columns, themselves bearing meaning through their orientation. `Reading' entailed logically putting together bits of connected information, not reconstituting articulate speech. Though the very earliest readings were perhaps of incomplete writing, these were none the less `complete readings'. For unlike writing, reading is not bound to language: reading is foremost visual (not oral) and conceptual (not linguistic). Whereas Egypt codified its hieroglyphic and hieratic signs early on, and so fossilized its writing system, for many centuries Sumer maintained a loose and ambiguous inventory of about eighteen hundred pictograms and symbols.11 Simplification and conventionalization occurred, and by 2700­2350 bc, with the tablets of Shuruppak, the inventory had been reduced to about eight hundred, with greater use of linearity (writing in lines of text). By roughly 2500 bc nearly all the graphic elements in Sumer's writing system had become sound units. And by 2000 bc only about 570 logograms were in everyday use.12 Wedges had replaced the earlier pictograms, now impressed by a reed stylus (a pointed writing instrument) into soft clay. The wedges became stylized, eventually losing identifiability. Most

Mesopotamian reading occurred in this cuneiform or wedgeshaped writing in clay, though cuneiforms were also carved in stone and inscribed on wax, ivory, metal and even glass. Very seldom, however, was cuneiform written in ink on papyrus, as scribes customarily wrote in Egypt. Mesopotamians read, then, foremost a `literature of clay'. Because of this, the physical act of reading was frequently problematical: to remain wieldy, clay tablets had to be palm-sized, obliging miniature texts. `To read' was Sumerian s ita (s it, s id, s ed), meaning also `to count, calculate, consider, memorize, recite, read aloud'. Very few in Mesopotamia could ever achieve this faculty. Around 2000 bc at Ur, the region's greatest metropolis with a population of around 12,000, only a small proportion ­ perhaps one out of a hundred, or about 120 people at most ­ could read and write. From 1850 to 1550 bc the Babylonian city-state of Sippar, with approximately 10,000 inhabitants, housed only 185 named `scribes' (that is, official tablet writers), ten of whom were in fact women.13 It appears from this and similar statistics elsewhere that no more than at most a few score literates were alive in Mesopotamia's city-states at any given time. Unless it was one of those rare, palm-sized, literary editions with its miniature text, a clay tablet was a large and ponderous thing, quite ill suited to leisurely reading. From this near-universal failure of Mesopotamian scribes to elaborate a more user-friendly literature, one can deduce that reading was predominantly work. That is, it was not a solitary, agreeable, silent business ­ but public, taxing and loud. The written word very often served simply to prompt the retrieval of a text earlier learnt by heart. For all Mesopotamian literature, even written literature, was public and oral. Writing was still a means to an end, the public performance, a tradition stretching back tens of thousands of years, and not yet an end in itself: the solitary confrontation with the written word. Tablets `spoke' for those whose seals were impressed on them. Judges in Babylon, for example, could speak of a tablet's contents as its `mouth', could publicly assert they had `heard' the tablet (in a way very similar to how today's judges regard affidavits).14 There was no contesting, no challenge by witnesses in attendance; denying one's seal brought severe
18 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

punishment. The written voice was the actual voice. For oral and written literature were one. By around 2500 bc then, or some three hundred years after the East Semitic Akkadians had invaded Sumer and risen to prominence, cuneiform script was complete and capable of conveying any and every thought in the Sumerian language, which the Akkadians continued to use (much as later Europeans preserved classical Greek and Latin). Essential in this process was the establishment, by convention, of a syllabary. This is an inventory of systematic signs used purely for their syllabic sound values: ti, mu, sa and so forth.15 In this learnable system the Sumero-Akkadian reader-reciter then declaimed the treasury of his, and also her, `native' literature. The entire Babylonian tradition is conveyed in these two languages: Sumerian and Akkadian. Many texts comprise lexical and grammatical compilations, displaying how involved the society was in fusing the two traditions in order to preserve the ancient legacy and to ensure continued understanding of ancient texts. Written until about ad 100, in its closing centuries Akkadian was mainly used as a literary, not a spoken, language. (As a spoken tongue, it competed with, and merged into, Babylonian and Assyrian, considered by some scholars to be linguistically distinct stages of evolved Akkadian.) The great Assyrian Empire, which, between 721 and 633 bc, stretched from Egypt to the Persian Gulf, used Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform writing to perpetuate the same traditions, which neighbours borrowed and adapted. Between approximately 550 and 350 bc Old Persian scribes used cuneiform writing, too, but in order to convey their IndoEuropean language with some 40 signs of both syllabic (ka) and phonemic (/k/) values.16 The Old Persian script is found in a small number of royal inscriptions, the longest and most important of these being the trilingual monument of Darius I (c. 550­486 bc) at Bisitun, western Iran:
Says Darius the king: If you look at this inscription or these sculptures, (and) do not destroy them (but), as long as there is strength to you, you care for them, may Ahuramazda ¯ be 17 friendly to you.

From the beginning, the physical form of reading material had been dictated by immediate purpose. The length of an early Mesopotamian text depended on a clay tablet's size, format, dimensions and `cartouches' (oblong figures enclosing significant units, like names). Early tablet compartments yielded later to horizontal lines, with writing on both sides of the tablet. The first literature (not accounting records) comprised square or oblong clay tablets around one finger-length in size, designed to fit comfortably in the reader's palm. A `book' comprised several of these, possibly stored in a wooden box or leather pouch in a given order for sequential retrieval. Public proclamations, laws and aggrandizing propaganda, such as royal funerary inscriptions, were often stone or clay texts of grandiose proportions, many to be consulted for reference (much as we use a public or corporate library today). In the twelfth century bc at Assur on the Tigris, for example, the Middle Assyrian Code of Laws, inscribed in columns on both sides, loomed in stone over six square metres in size, its public prominence bespeaking authority, its text more feared than read.18 Who did read, then? Scribes, mostly. However, school tablets have emerged out of the ruins of most of the wealthier residences of Ur. Apparently an ability to read penetrated to the Mesopotamian domestic domain as well, though it is unclear exactly to what extent this obtained.19 It is possible that the ability to read and write, already in the third millennium bc, was one of the distinguishing qualities of the aristocracy. Perhaps this ability helped to define the aristocracy as a distinct class. If so, then reading and writing would have experienced wide emulation. A Sumerian scribe doubtless possessed a great sense of responsibility for this highly valued faculty, knowing it was his or her interpretation of a written text that publicly settled a dispute over accounts or an article of law. The goddess of scribes, Nisaba, had as her symbol the stylus, as it was the act of recording that embodied the scribe's primary role, not the act of reading-reciting. This tells us that a scribe was foremost the notary public of his and her era, the notarial stenographer of most of society's important activities, the executive secretary, the governmental bureaucrat.

Of course reading as we know it today played no role in this vital business of state. From grain shipments to temple tributes, from simple messages to lengthy accolades, the everyday complexity of town life was enabled by these reciting scribes ­ and everywhere oral communication took precedence. The written word was still not a voice that existed for itself. (This phenomenon emerged in the fourth century bc, in Greece; see Chapter 2.) For thousands of years, reading was a medium; it was not yet a channel. It is for this reason that we hear the author's precise instructions to the scribe in most Mesopotamian letters: `To My Lord, say this: thus speaks So-and-so, your servant'.20 The scribe could not separate, as we do today, oral instruction from oral message. Scribal duty actually forbade such separation ... as it protected the scribe from potential litigation. But scribes were not exclusively notaries, stenographers, accountants, archivists, secretaries and bureaucrats. They were also active readers whose non-literate superiors or patrons ­ whether architect, astronomer, merchant or priest ­ regularly bade them read aloud, either out of duty or for a small fee. If hyperopic (far-sighted, as most men over 45 tend to be), the scribe could use a pair of hollow reeds, held in one hand, to help focus his eyes to make out the often excruciatingly tiny cuneiforms on the small tablet cradled in the palm of the other hand. A clear drinking glass filled with water might have helped also, the small tablet positioned behind it to magnify the minute wedges. Reading these scribes' ancient correspondence today, in translation, opens up to us an exotic and inscrutable world, one surprisingly filled, though, with familiar human emotions and weaknesses. Like the merchant Nanni's dictated letter to his business associate Ea-nasir in Ur around 1700 bc:
You did not do what you promised me. You put ingots that were not good before my messenger and said: `If you want to take them, take them; if you don't want them go away!' What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me in such a fashion? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to reclaim my money, but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty handed several times. . .
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 21

Take notice that from now on I will no longer accept any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall henceforth select the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.21

To become a professional scribe in Babylon in 1700 bc, boys had to attend, from age six to 18, scribal school from early morning to late afternoon for 24 days in every 30.22 Here they learnt to read and write defunct Sumerian and their native Akkadian, as well as history, mathematics, religious literature and the preparation of legal contracts, one of the principal activities of their chosen profession.23 Though reading and writing formed a large part of the curriculum, much of the material remained oral, neither written down nor read. Indeed, the vast majority of Babylon's social knowledge was transmitted orally and was never committed to clay. From unearthed tablets it has been possible to reconstruct the scribal schools' method of teaching reading. Reading was learnt through the act of writing. First the teacher covered one side of a small tablet with a sign, whereupon the pupil wrote the same sign over and over again on the reverse. Then two signs were paired to form a complete word, which the pupil similarly reproduced. In an Akkadian school, for example, the word ana (`to') was split into two separate syllables using the signs a and na. (The writing system, a syllabography, allowed only this conventional pairing; that is, there existed no separate signs for ana or an-.) In the third stage the pupil studied a proverb, short sentence or list of names, then reversed the tablet and reproduced this, too. In reversing the tablet, the pupil was being forced to visualize the text in order to rewrite it. Above all else, visualization, transcending mechanical imitation, enabled the pupil to become an independent reader and writer ­ it etched the signs and their permissible combinations into memory. Yet one had to have a visual inventory not only of individual signs, but also of whole words, names, phrases, even complete sentences. (This was indeed a form of the same `whole-word' method of learning to read that was rediscovered by Western educationalists in the eighteenth century ad.)
22 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Once a professional, the scribe could look forward to a life of mostly documenting transactions. In particular this entailed financial exchanges, which required exact transcription of the oral agreement and the official witnessing (the `notarization') by the scribe himself or herself. Other successful graduates became bookkeepers and accountants for merchants, shippers or royal temples (where visitors often received receipts for their offerings). Especially gifted graduates, those commanding difficult mathematics, became highly respected surveyors. Drop-outs and failures could still become respectable letter-writers and letterreaders, who were always in demand under their awnings in nearly every town and village market. Unlike today, scribes were seldom their society's creative writers: all creative literature remained oral. Such orally composed works were, however, sometimes preserved on clay by a scribe, on command or request. Nearly all Mesopotamian pupils were boys, the ones expected to assume the family responsibilities or allowed to become professional scribes. However, there were rare exceptions (as with Sippar above). Significantly, the first author in history who signed a work was a woman: Princess Enheduanna, daughter of King Sargon I of Akkad. Born c. 2300 bc, she composed, as High Priestess of Nanna, god of the moon, a series of songs in praise of the goddess of love and war, Inanna, duly recording her own name as author-scribe at the end of her tablets.24 This, however, was something exceptional. In ancient Mesopotamia it was customary for a scribe to record in a colophon ­ a closing inscription giving peripheral information ­ his (sometimes her) name, location and date of writing, as this officially verified the oral transmission. For readers were not yet `reading a text', but still hearing the voice of a scribal colleague who needed identification. Most Mesopotamian colophons end with the maxim `Let the tutored instruct the tutored, for the untutored may not see',25 meaning that as only few command reading and writing, their social responsibility is profound and should not be forgotten or taken lightly. Rare archæological discoveries of ancient archives provide perhaps the best evidence of what people were then reading in Mesopotamia.26 During excavations conducted from 1973 to
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 23

1976 at the acropolis of Tell Mardikh, for example, 60 km from Aleppo in north-west Syria, archæologists unearthed the royal palace of Ebla (2400­2250 bc), including nearly seventeen thousand tablets lying in Ebla's administrative sector, audience court and royal archives. The tablets display a wide variety of subjects: history, literature, agriculture, language, but above all finances and economy. Indeed, most address taxes, tributes, state correspondence, caravans, trade missions and reports. It was predominantly the reading of bureaucrats, accountants and clerks; only a small percentage conveyed non-administrative subjects. One can assume, from Ebla's significance, that this typified larger cities' reading material for the era. The Sumerian Uruk iii period (c. 3000 bc) ­ that is, before continuous texts were written ­ had yielded the very earliest readings: `lexical' lists.27 True literary texts were unknown until about 2500 bc under the Akkadians who, at first, wrote only in Sumerian. Literary texts in Old Akkadian itself only began to appear after 2334 bc, under Sargon I.28 These are chiefly hymns to the gods, songs with entreaties for the king, cult dirges and exorcisms of evil spirits. An important Sumerian myth memorialized the journey of the goddess Inanna to the underworld. Akkadian scribes also preserved the Sumerian divine order of the world. The tales of Uruk's kings Enmerkar, Lugalbanda and especially Gilgamesh dominated the epic genre.29 The Sumero-Akkadian writing system conveyed a wealth of oral genres: epic, legal, medical, culinary, astronomical, mathematical, historical, religious, love poems and many more.30 Didactic poetry was particularly `popular' (always a relative term) in ancient Babylon, such as the Akkadian epic of the creation of the world from the era of King Hammurabi (c. eighteenth century bc), glorifying the god Marduk. Such works combine epic and hymn in a rather discordant literary hybrid. Above all, Akkadian literature excelled in prayers and conjurations. About 1000 bc a tone of pessimism infused its literature, as in the celebrated psalm `I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom', which laments the injustice done to the suffering righteous. There was also writing that only supernatural beings were meant to read. During the first millennium bc at the city of Nippur (in today's Iraq), for example, people purchasing clay
24 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

bowls inscribed with Aramaic incantations believed that, through reading the incantations, malevolent spirits would become trapped under the bowls. That is, the writing itself held magical power. It required no human audience. Few Middle Eastern texts earlier than the first centuries of the second millennium bc have survived. The evidence suggests, for example, that most of the oral Gilgamesh poems ­ the great King of Uruk who vainly searched for immortality ­ were not actually written down until c. 1200 bc. Their final recension occurred at the library of King Ashurbanipal (ruled 669­633 bc), the last great ruler of the Assyrian Empire. Most reading of course involved things of the everyday economy, which the era's scribes performed with the ease and efficiency of today's white-collar worker. More than 75 per cent of the 150,000 cuneiform inscriptions so far excavated in Mesopotamia are bookkeeping and administrative records, the earliest of which are mostly simple lists of goods, people, payments and such.31 As with Ebla, all early Mesopotamian centres had `libraries', that is archives and files, not the literary repositories we know today. Such depots of readily accessible information were held to be essential for the proper administration of burgeoning citystates. By the end of the second millennium bc these depots of clay tablets, papyri, wooden boards, bamboo sticks, silk or leather were empowering societies in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Iranian Plateau, the Ægean, the Indus Valley, Uzbekistan/Tajikistan and Central China. As all reading was then aloud, the simile `loud as a library' would everywhere have been appropriate. Sumerians called those who catalogued libraries `ordainers of the universe'.32 Cataloguing a library means fragmenting human experience. All catalogization is subjective and arbitrary, an offence to the written work: that is, to something intrinsically universal and indivisible. This offence has been committed in every epoch, generally in the name of utilitarianism. Since life itself is uncatalogued, reading should be uncatalogued. However, this is impractical. More useful access to information is won only through limiting the limitless, as the earliest literate societies already discovered.
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 25

At his capital, Nineveh, Ashurbanipal of Assyria possessed a cuneiform library that so far has yielded nearly twenty-five thousand inscribed clay tablets. Ashurbanipal revered writing. He was himself literate, a rarity for a ruler at the time. He boasted that he could `read tablets written before the Flood', that is ancient texts which evidently had been preserved for many centuries.33 His declared love of reading shows the veneration literacy enjoyed at this time. Ashurbanipal even sent agents to every corner of Mesopotamia in search of tablets for the palace library. His personal letter to an official named Shadanu is revealing in this regard:
Seek out and bring me the precious tablets for which there are no transcripts existing in Assyria. I have just now written to the temple overseer and the mayor of Borsippa that you, Shadanu, are to keep the tablets in your storehouse and that nobody shall refuse to hand over tablets to you. If you hear of any tablet or ritual text that is suitable for the palace, seek it out, secure it, and send it here.34

In this way Ashurbanipal amassed an uncommonly large library for the epoch. It held an unusually high percentage of ritual writings, too: astrology, omens and incantations ­ that is, resources for understanding, placating and coercing the gods. In his letter Ashurbanipal draws a significant distinction between `tablet' and `ritual text', betraying the acquired importance of devotional reading. But works of mathematics, medicine, astronomy, epic poetry, songs, hymns, bilingual Sumerian-Babylonian dictionaries and many other subjects also found favour. Here, reading is unmistakably appreciated as being a fount of general knowledge and a means to access and direct the divine. (Today, Ashurbanipal's library offers the richest source of reading about the ancient cultures of Sumer, Babylonia and Assyria.) Found on one particular medicinal tablet, most of which was destroyed, was the revelation:
Palace of Ashurbanipal, king of totality, king of Assyria, whom [the gods] Nabu and Tashmetum gave broad wisdom, who acquired sharp eyes: The best of the scribal art, such works as
26 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

none of the kings who went before me had ever learnt, remedies from the top of the head to the toenails, non-canonical selections, clever teachings, whatever pertains to the medical mastery of [the gods] Ninurta and Gula, I wrote on tablets, checked and collated, and deposited within my palace for perusing and reading.35

That is, it was Ashurbanipal himself writing these words, revealing the ultimate purpose of his remarkable collection: `perusing and reading'. Because of his pre-eminence, Ashurbanipal also received correspondence from throughout Assyria and beyond. At the end of one such letter the royal secretary, the one customarily screening Ashurbanipal' s incoming post, encountered the illuminating appeal: `Whoever you are, scribe, who is going to read this letter, do not conceal anything from the King, my lord, so that the gods Bel and Nabu ¯ should speak kindly of you to the King.'36 Again, `read' is understood as signifying `read aloud, recite'. In these early societies, where the written word was the spoken word, the highest integrity was demanded of each scribal secretary. It was with good reason that one of the laws of the Babylonian king Hammurabi demanded death for him who bore false witness, a law targeting primarily scribes, society's chief witnesses. Censorship took place often. This mainly involved effacing what was written on public monuments and on temple and palace walls in order to erase the luminary's memory, the highest form of public disgrace. But texts were altered, too: either directly, by scraping off and rewriting (which was impossible on hard clay tablets, necessitating frequent forgeries), or indirectly, by editing a wholly new text, that is, by `rewriting history'. This occurred with surprising frequency, for many reasons: filial or fraternal hatred, clan rivalry, altered ethic or religion, invasion and other things. Readers of course then read only what the new regime wanted them to read, which was as far from `factual objectivity' (a modern conceit) as the effaced propaganda had been. Ancient reading so frequently displays poignant humanity. The son of one of Hammurabi's high officials wrote to his mother:
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 27

May my father and the gods keep you well. Gentlemen's clothes improve year by year. The son of Adadiddinam, whose father is a mere underling of my father, has received two new garments, but you keep getting upset over just one garment for me. Though you gave birth to me, his mother adopted him; whereas his mother loves him, you do not love me.37

Through this and many similarly moving and enlightening passages we come to appreciate how Mesopotamian reading already encompassed an entire universe of human experience, its poignancy made all the more immediate by our awareness that, in writing's place of birth, the voice and the sign were still one.

egypt
The commonest Egyptian word for reading, s dj, also signified `recite', and it was for this reason that the Egyptian scribe whose words began this chapter wrote of a book being `in the mouth of the speaker who reads him'. Reading in ancient Egypt, too, was doubly oral: not only was writing understood to be visible speech, but all reading was physically performed aloud through a scribe-witness. We read on a cuneiform tablet letter, therefore, sent to Egypt from the Hurrians (an important Near Eastern people in the middle of the second millennium bc): `And Kelia, my messenger, said this word: thus speaking, "Your brother, Nimmoria, the lord of Egypt, made a great gift"'.38 As in Mesopotamia, written correspondence in Egypt was not reading as we know it, but the official witnessing of an oral medium. All letters generally began with the statement, `Say to So-and-so, the king of So-and-so, my brother etc. ...', including the dictator's verbal instructions to the scribe. Here, too, the written word was not an end in itself, but a means to an end, a socially sanctioned medium (not yet an autonomous channel) through which the scribe was permitted to speak on behalf of the person dictating the message. The `true' message lay not in the cuneiform tablet or papyrus missive, but in the ultimate oral transmission: that is, the scribe reading the message aloud to its addressee.
28 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

As early as c. 3300 bc Egypt was already using several hundred logographic (whole-word) `hieroglyphs', written principally in ink on papyrus. The era of papyrus witnessed the rapid rise of urban federations in Egypt that would endure for over three millennia. Reading and writing are not criteria for civilization; indeed, urban activity had obtained in north-eastern Syria as early as 4000 bc, shortly before complete writing emerged. However, Egypt's Upper and Lower Kingdoms, and the Mesopotamian city-states, advanced and thrived, becoming great empires, only after reading and writing had emerged. No direct causal relationship held, of course, but few would dispute the role of reading and writing in stimulating the economic expansion that empowered such events.39 Early Egyptians appear to have appreciated reading's advantages for information access and control better than the Sumerians who had innovated complete writing. This is because the Egyptians, once they had borrowed from Sumer the concepts of logography, phonography and linearity with sequencing of signs, developed and exploited reading and writing much more quickly. One of the Egyptians' most important native innovations (there were several) was acrophony, the use of a sign to represent only a word's beginning consonant: the sign represented n, for example. (In contrast, Sumerian scribes used signs representing whole syllables, not individual consonants.) All Egyptian hieroglyphic writing furnished word `skeletons' to which the reader needed to add only the appropriate vowels, obvious to native speakers from the context.40 As early as the fourth millennium bc Egyptians were reading hieroglyphs on rock faces, slate palettes, funerary stelæ (upright stone slabs with inscriptions), cylindrical seals, jar-stoppers, pottery, ivory tablets, stone club-heads and other things. A frequent use of ink on papyri is presumed already for this earliest period. Most reading in ancient Egypt was not of hieroglyphs, however, which were very time-consuming to carve, incise or paint, but of cursive writing (only much later called `hieratic'). This script had developed as a practical tool for writing commonplace documents, such as letters, accounts, dockets and, later, as of the second millennium bc, literary texts. A simplification of hieroglyphic writing that used the same system, hieratic was read
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 29

almost exclusively on papyrus, though hieratic texts also appeared on stone, wood, plaster, leather, linen cloth, ostraca (inscribed potsherds) and other surfaces. Egyptian readers read either from right to left or from left to right; some texts follow from top to bottom. Right-to-left reading became the `default' direction, if no clear reason existed to choose otherwise. Once formalized between c. 3300 and 2500 bc, hieroglyphs, hieratic writing and their readings remained little changed for well over two thousand years. (Most readers in northern Africa and the Middle East have kept a right-to-left reading direction ever since.) Once a pupil had completed several years of intensive instruction in a special scribal school, the reading of Egyptian hieroglyphic and hieratic texts came to be a relatively undemanding practice, with quality of literacy of course varying greatly (being primarily task-orientated). Perhaps more significantly, papyrus was thin, lightweight, flexible and easily held and stored. One could even combine papyrus sheets and roll them up as a long narrow scroll, needing only simple unrolling in order to read a voluminous text. (Such reading ease was unknown in Mesopotamia, with its unwieldy clay tablets.) The `oldest book in the world' is the Pruss Papyrus, whose texts of the Fifth Dynasty (c. 2500­2350 bc) were copied, in hieratic script, approximately four hundred years later than this. As early as the Third or Fourth Dynasty, however, continuous texts were being written in Egypt. Though in theory the writing system could then be used for nearly any purpose, Egyptian scribes still did not exploit its full capabilities. By c. 2150 bc, at the end of the Old Kingdom, several categories of text were common: private contracts, legal decrees and proceedings, letters, long religious and magical texts as well as `biographical' inscriptions.41 Probably technical writings existed, too, but apparently no intrinsically `literary' texts were yet entrusted to papyrus, wood or leather: the oral tradition prevailed in all genres, keeping writing restricted to documentation, not creative expression. Few Egyptians ever learnt to read. For most of the country's ancient history, probably not more than one in a hundred was literate at any given time. Considering how Egypt's population
30 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

rose from the Old Kingdom's estimated one million to the Greco-Roman era's 4.5 million (when Greek residents comprised the literate majority), perhaps no more than ten to fifty thousand could read in the entire empire.42 These literates comprised the élite, distinguished in their society chiefly, but not exclusively (for most used scribal slaves), by their ability to read and write. They and the scribal sub-élite almost exclusively occupied all administrative offices. Unlike Mesopotamia, Egypt shows no evidence of scribes enjoying substantial careers separate from public office. The village scribe, however, was similarly a respected amanuensis for hire, who provided the 99 per cent of non-literates with the customary access to reading and writing. All Egyptians could, of course, `read' such pictorially reinforced inscriptions as those on the walls of the Temple of Luxor at ancient Thebes, heralding the story of the triumphant charge of chariot-borne archers under Pharaoh Ramesses II against the Hittites in 1300 bc. The average literate himself could probably read little more than simple words here and there in the inscription, perhaps even a few familiar names in recognizable combinations of hieroglyphs.43 The best-known names would be such frequently occurring sign groupings or cartouches as that of Menkheperre`, the prenomen of Thutmose III (1479­1425 bc), which has survived on thousands of scarabs. However, only very few Egyptians, perhaps one out of five hundred or even fewer, could actually read a monumental inscription in its entirety. Because so very few ancient Egyptians could read and write, and those who did exclusively comprised the élite (or their slaves), the faculty was held in extremely high regard. Here, scribes actually occupied a social station much more elevated than that of their Mesopotamian counterparts. As the Egyptian bureaucrat Dua-Khety told his son Pepy four millennia ago while they sailed south along the Nile to a school for scribes:
Set your thoughts just on writings, for I have seen people saved by their labour. Behold, there is nothing greater than writings. They are like a boat on water. Let me cause you to love writing more than [you love] your mother. Let me usher
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 31

its beauty into your sight. For it is greater than any office. There is nothing like it on earth.44

The profession of Egyptian scribe could be `a princely profession', as Dua-Khety further maintained: `His writing materials and his rolls of books bring pleasantness and riches'. Many scribes went on to become palace officials and ministers, among the wealthiest and most powerful men in the empire. Most scribes, however, remained subordinates who carried out the mundane business of the realm. Literacy was necessary for high status, but then the physical act of writing was subsequently most often delegated by those few who had actually attained to that status. Illustrative of this is the polite way of saying `you' in written Egyptian correspondence: `your scribe', that is, the subordinate encharged to read the missive aloud to his literate superior.45 As in Mesopotamia, hyperopic (far-sighted) readers would also have had reading aids. It has recently been argued that the Egyptians might have known of the special properties of glass lenses as early as the beginning of the second millennium bc, when glass production became common along the Nile. It is indeed possible that readers with hyperopia compensated by using disks of polished glass or clear stone. A papyrus scroll held behind a clear drinking glass filled with water would also have been magnified and perfectly legible to any suffering from hyperopia: this would have been common knowledge in ancient times. Many of the glass vessels preserved from antiquity might actually have served reading as frequently as drinking; society's readers, the élite (or their slaves), owned most glass vessels. Almost from the beginning, writing in Egypt served two main purposes: administration and monumental display.46 But apparently for the first half millennium after writing's introduction in Egypt continuous texts were unknown. The earliest written records, indeed the beginning of `history' itself, comprised merely the simple names of regnal years. Because the élite had early seized on writing's social power ­ the bulk of Egyptian reading being administrative, its practitioners society's privileged ­ élite status was wholly identified with literacy.47 (Evidence suggests that later pharaohs themselves were literate,
32 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

something which obtained only rarely in Mesopotamia.)48 Very little of Egypt's wealth of administrative literature has survived, however. What has endured the millennia, primarily architectural or monumental inscriptions, represents only a fraction of what was once written down. It is in no way representative of the majority of ancient reading. Indeed, it is one of history's greatest ironies that this glorious society, which is so identified with writing (that is, with hieroglyphs), whose temples, tombs, monuments and statues veritably brimmed over with writing, enjoyed the fewest actual readers. But public texts were to impress, not to inform. Contemporaries who could actually read them had been their engravers. Inscriptions were written for the centuries, perceived `readers' the future faceless hordes of venerators ­ or so imagined the inscriptions' illustrious authors. This means the Egyptian hieroglyphs that survive today, on mummy coffins, tomb walls, monumental columns and statuary, were probably only seldom, if ever, read in the lifetime of their addressor. They were almost exclusively ostentatious propaganda for the divine as well as the living, and funerary messages to the gods of the afterlife and to the deceased, calling out the magical words to awake the spirit. What was actually read was mountains of administrative papyri, and these have almost entirely vanished. The very earliest Egyptian literary, as distinct from administrative, texts are the Pyramid Texts, hidden in the royal burial apartments.49 These comprise the funerary literature inscribed in pyramid burial chambers of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties. The late twenty-fifth-century bc wall-to-wall inscriptions filling the antechamber of the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara, for example, describe the ruler's perilous journey through the underworld to his rightful place among the gods. The literate thirteenthcentury bc builder of royal tombs, Peshdu, covered the ceiling of his own tomb with the Litany of Re, a holy text celebrating the Sun God's eternal passage between heaven and the underworld. Statuettes depicting the lowest classes ­ farmworkers, labourers and others ­ were incised with the names of the deceased and placed in the graves of the wealthy to serve them in the afterlife. All such hallowed `Utterances', preserving Egypt's earliest
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 33

recorded religious beliefs, memorialize the hereafter, incant against evil and/or perform holy office for the dead, to be read by gods alone, of whom the deceased was seeking inclusion. Comprising a pharaoh's or aristocrat's `passport to eternity', they addressed and permitted no other readers. It was the world's most exclusive college. One preserved text in a nobleman's tomb reads:
You that voyage over the sky, Re and Thoth, take him unto you to be with you, that he may eat of that whereof you eat; that he may drink of that whereof you drink; that he may live on that whereon you live; that he may dwell there where you dwell; that he may be strong wherein you are strong; that he may voyage there where you voyage.50

Similar otherworldly reading included tens of thousands of sarcophagal inscriptions and the ubiquitous Book of the Dead, a papyrus roll given to the deceased to take with him or her into the afterlife. Temple walls, columns and statuary, too, abounded with inscriptions addressing an immortal readership. The Temple of Isis at Philae, for example, every internal surface of which was covered with writing and some design-work, described royal gifts to `immortal witnesses' of a literal ilk. Greater biographical information than mere title strings and captions began appearing on royal monuments only after the Old Kingdom period, and included ethical precepts, marks of royal favour, assertions of social norms and so forth.51 During the Middle Kingdom scribes incorporated outstanding events. Actual literary texts also began to appear: `wisdom' literature, narratives, hymns, medical, magical, mathematical, astronomical and calendrical texts. None was `popular' in the modern sense, of course, for readership was extremely small and socially restricted. One remarkable feature of such ancient Egyptian texts is that most of them were written down in a special form of metre, that is their language patterns were formalized into individual units of two or three stresses each. The New Kingdom heralded literary genres for a wider audience. Many papyri from this era contain love poems and simple stories of folkloric cast.52 Religious texts described rituals of daily
34 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

devotion and supernatural events. There were papyrus rolls of hymns, myths and magical formulas. Works on medicine (including gynæcology and veterinary science), mathematics, history and lexicography (long lists of animals, plants, parts of the body and geographical names as memory prompts) have survived the millennia. As in Mesopotamia, didactic texts were rife, in particular those providing instructions in practical living, such as the `Teaching of King Amenemhet' or the later `Book of Wisdom of Amenemope', extolling modesty and self-control. Famous in this context is the `Conversation of a Melancholic with His Soul', probably ancient Egypt's most profound literary legacy. Numerous writings also describe or praise, sometimes ironically, life at a scribal school. Factual tales, such as the `History of Sinuhe', mixing adventure with worldly wisdom, were very common. In the later Greek era, fiction in particular assumed a special place among Egyptian readers. Dramatic texts for religious festivals surfaced. And everywhere poetic texts, of strict metrical structure, abounded, ranging from work songs to pæans to the gods or pharaoh. (Two significant collections of Egyptian love songs, for example, have survived.) At all levels of society letters were always an extremely important reading material. Around 1500 bc international epistles comprised clay cuneiform tablets small enough to be carried in one hand, such as the Babylonian king Kadasman-Enlil's invitation to Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV), pharaoh of Egypt:
I am going to have a house-warming. Come yourself to eat and drink with me. In attendance shall be twenty-five women and twenty-five men.53

The above belongs to the collection of some 380 letters, covering approximately three decades, discovered in the late 1800s at Tell El-Amarna (ancient Akhenaten). The period of the Amarna Letters, as they came to be called, includes the entire reign of Akhenaten (1353­1336 bc), when Egypt's culture and political power were at their zenith, distinguishing the most powerful kingdom the world had yet known. The letters consist of diplomatic correspondence between the pharaoh and his
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 35

contemporaries in neighbouring lands, as well as his vassals governing cities and towns under Egyptian administration. Each letter follows a strict protocol of diplomatic rhetoric. They often commence with such courteous salutations as:
Say to Nimmureya [Akhenaten], the king of Egypt my brother, my son-in-law, whom I love and who loves me: `Thus, Tushratta, the king of Mitanni, your father-in-law, who loves you, your brother [ally]. For me all goes well. For you may all go well. For your household, for your wives, for your sons, for your magnates, for your chariots, for your horses, for your warriors, for your country and whatever else belongs to you, may all go very, very well'.54

Whereupon the correspondent would customarily follow this with a plea for troops, money, gifts and the like. Or, rarely, quite the opposite. In his letter, Tushratta was announcing his own gift to Akhenaten ... of a concubine:
`She has become very mature, and she has been fashioned according to my brother's [your] desire. And, furthermore, my brother will note that the greeting gift that I shall present is greater than any before.'

Written entirely in cuneiform, the Amarna Letters mostly convey Old Babylonian, the language of diplomacy and trade at this time, the lingua franca of the ancient Near East. For his response, however, the pharaoh would dictate in Egyptian to a scribe who wrote hieratic signs in ink on papyrus. The scribe then passed this along to a royal translator who composed an Old Babylonian version, in turn inscribing this in cuneiform on a clay tablet to be dispatched by a palace courier. The courier would hasten to the addressee's locale, seek admittance, then deliver the tablet to the proper authority, who would then bring the tablet to the addressee, together with a translator if required, and the text of the letter would be read aloud. One of the most poignant letters of the Amarna Period was one sent to King Suppiluliumash of the Hittites by Ankhesenpaaten, Tutankhamun's young widow, who was being
36 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

pressed to wed the 30-year-older designated successor Ay:
My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons. You might give me one of your sons, and he might become my husband. I would not want to take one of my servants [i.e., Ay]. I am loath to make him my husband.

The Hittite king acquiesced. But then his young son was murdered on his way to Egypt, and so Ankhesenpaaten, probably fearing for her own life, condescended to marry Ay. Ancient Egyptian reading was far more than information conveyance: the very spirit of a text was being conveyed as well. Unlike Mesopotamia's utilitarian cuneiform wedges, Egyptian hieroglyphs, in particular, were believed to hold magical power. Reading them on sarcophagi and tomb walls and ceilings was a divine utterance, helping to bring their message into fulfilment. For the same reason, their frequent defacement meant to preclude the lives, deeds and socio-spiritual power of their owners being called back into life again through reading aloud. For reading such things was an act of creation itself. Just as in Mesopotamia, however, Egypt had its assortment of libraries: at palaces, temples, administrative centres and even the private residences of wealthy literates. From Edfu has come a catalogue of catalogues, dating from c. 2000 bc, revealing how ancient Egyptian librarians, too, were attempting to define their world of experience with such categories as `The List of All Writings Engraved in Wood', `The Book of Places and What Is in Them', `The Book of What Is to Be Found in the Temple' and many more.55 Over the millennia Egypt arrived at transmitting noteworthy written texts in generally accurate copies. The most prestigious were probably narratives and didactic writings; these maintained a well-defined structure in a distinctly `non-oral' style (usually that of brief epithets, to be read aloud in a form of metre). Of similar importance were Egyptian magical texts; these were very widely read, the spells' efficacy dependent on the accuracy of their copyists. None the less, ancient Egyptians never achieved a discursive or analytic history, never implemented a religious
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 37

canon or exegesis (such as Judaism, Christianity or Islam were later to implement through reading). There was neither an indigenous oral epic nor scripture. Egyptians remained in a common intermediate position, their society `aided by literacy but not transformed by it'.56

spreading the written word
The idea, as well as many conventions, of Mesopotamian writing diffused also eastward. For the Proto-Elamite people of the Iranian Plateau c. 3000 bc, reading was actuarial: their longest surviving text, comprising only seven lines, treats of sheep delivered as taxes to the central administration at Susa. Yet five hundred years earlier, people as far away as the Indus Valley were using potters' marks to write names and/or places; this then apparently developed into the (assumed) logosyllabic writing system of the Indus Valley civilization, which thrived between 2500 and 1900 bc. It is probable that the Indus people predominantly wrote on something perishable like leather or wood, which has since rotted away, leaving no trace. Although no literature has survived from this rich culture (that is, no long tablets, papyri or monumental inscriptions), the ubiquity of the many inscribed seals, brief clay and faience tablets, bronze tools and utensils, bone and ivory rods and other things ­ usually bearing two or three signs in a line and five signs in total ­ suggests a restricted and rudimentary `literacy'. In a side room of the northern gateway at the ancient centre of Dholavira was found an inscription comprised of signs more than 30 cm in height: perhaps it was a `public sign' of some sort. Used principally to validate and solidify economic authority, reading and writing in the ancient Indus Valley appear also to have been closely associated with the ruling élite of leading centres, in particular Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.57 By c. 2000 bc, syllabic reading ­ that is, of in-di-vi-du-al syllables ­ was enriching the Semites of Byblos in the Levant, the Luwians of Anatolia (today's Turkey) and the earliest Greeks of the Ægean. In fact, Greeks were Europe's first readers. Their various scripts ­ the Minoan Greeks' `hieroglyphic' script and
38 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Linear A, the later Mycenæan Greeks' Linear B, Cypro-Minoan and, finally, the `Cypriote Syllabic Script' ­ mainly conveyed accounting. However, there were longer readings, such as dedications, contracts and even royal proclamations. This latter use of Ægean writing is evidenced by Crete's celebrated Phaistos Disk, Europe's earliest literature. Unearthed in 1908 and dating from c. 1600 bc, this baked clay disk, 16 cm in diameter with 241 hieroglyphic syllabic signs imprinted on both sides, apparently conveys a `mobilization proclamation' in Minoan Greek.58 The text on the Phaistos Disk is too short to be documentation: a native speaker could easily have memorized its message. As a royal proclamation disk, however, it validated the oral performance in a similar manner to much later Hebrew, Christian and Islamic reading performances, which emphasize the authority speaking through the written word. (Today, though he knows each text by heart the Pope, for example, still chants before an open book.) With the Phaistos Disk, the herald was not so much `reading' as performing a royal act: becoming the voice of (possibly) the Minos of Crete himself. Was there a body of `literature' to read in any of the several Ægean scripts of prehistory? None has appeared so far. It is possible such literature ­ hymns, songs, epic histories in imitation of those of the Greeks' influential trading partners the Canaanites and Egyptians ­ did indeed find written expression, but on perishable leather and papyrus. Certainly only a small handful of people in this early European society could read and write. And the rudimentary libraries at Knossos, Phaistos, Mycenæ, Athens and elsewhere would only rarely have transcended immediate archival requirements. Here, too, `literature' was still perceived as something intrinsically oral. By the fourteenth to thirteenth centuries bc at Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra') in the northern Levant, however, scribes were actively recording myths, legends, rituals, contracts and thousands of bookkeeping records in the local alphabetic script written in cuneiform wedges. And within three hundred years the great age of inscriptions began in Phoenicia, using fully developed consonantal alphabetic writing. But who were the readers of the hundreds of stelæ and other stone monuments erected at Byblos, Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, Ashkelon and other
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 39

coastal centres? For here, too, only very few people could read, perhaps no more than one in a hundred. In point of fact such inscribed monuments were more a show than a practice of reading. The ruler's act of having left a written statement sufficed; it was unnecessary to hear his voice. Power and prestige lay in presence. Aramaic writing developed from Phoenician around the tenth century bc, and by the eighth or seventh century bc Aramaic had become the main language and script of the Near East, the lingua franca of the entire region. Eventually it became the official language of the Persian Empire (550­330 bc). In the sixth century bc, for example, Persia's King Darius, who also left many inscribed monuments, placed in the audience hall at Persepolis two trilingual gold plaques (replicated also in silver) asking the god Ahuramazda ¯ in Aramaic to protect Darius and safeguard his household. As with Egypt's temple and tomb inscriptions, this was reading for gods alone, but now on small portable wealth. Aramaic writing also replaced Assyrian cuneiform: ink on leather or papyrus was now preferred over wedges in soft clay. The Age of Clay was coming to an end, never to return. In the main, Aramaic `literature' similarly comprised official documents, general administration, accounts, bookkeeping, monumental inscriptions and other things. Of crucial importance was Aramaic's inspiration of the writing system of the Indian subcontinent, the first longer documents of which are the famous edicts of King Asoka from c. 253­250 bc, carved on stone pillars or rocks throughout Hindustan.

religion and reading
As the amount of reading and writing increased, everywhere the visually talented displaced the orally talented. (In the West, Middle East and China, this process was essentially complete by classical antiquity.) Religion played an enormous role in this transformation. Throughout history, one of the chief motors of literacy has been religion. Priest-scribes had been among society's first readers. They were followed by élite scholars and then
40 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

by lay celebrants, who, in turn, expanded and diversified their reading material, eventually leading to a concept of general education. It is an illuminating fact in the history of reading that the distribution of writing systems and scripts in the world today `reflects the distribution of the world religions far more clearly than it does the distribution of language families'.59 Because writing is such an effective medium of arresting, preserving and conveying sacred knowledge, able to safeguard verbatim the extended teachings of venerated personalities without human oral mediation, reading and writing of religious literature began to play an ever more salient role in society. In Western Europe, religious literature came to dominate reading for well over a thousand years. (In other parts of the world, particularly Islamic nations, it still dominates reading.) In the first millennium bc readers of religious literature were mainly priests who had trained as scribes. They wrote down oral traditions dictated to them, which they then read aloud at sacred offices. Forming a special élite, they were able to influence, control and steer society by virtue of their unique position. It was at this time that the phrase `for it is written' came to take on authoritative, indeed divine, significance, which lingers with us still. Society's literary readers ­ that is, the same priest-scribes ­ also became commentators. In time, owing to the authority of their authors, the commentaries themselves became scripture: that is, holy writ. A significant amount of the world's religious reading emerged in the last half of the first millennium bc. Buddhism's Pal Canon, for example, deriving from oral tradition and containing the teaching of the Buddha (c. 563-483 bc), was written down in Pali, the canonical language for Buddhists from many countries. As Buddhism developed, comparable texts in other languages flourished, especially in East Asia among the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese. At the same time, Hinduism was being conveyed through a variety of texts known collectively as the Ve ¯ das; written in the Sanskrit language, these were chiefly preserved through a strict oral tradition insisting on accuracy of pronunciation. In fact, most religious writings failed to experience direct veneration. Only the oral tradition was truly venerated. In the West, however, veneration of the written
t h e i m m o r t a l w i t n e s s . 41

texts themselves emerged (see Chapter 2). This custom was institutionalized by the Jews who, many centuries later, inspired early Christians to emulation. Up until the fifth century bc reading was essentially passive. It involved overwhelmingly accounts, tallies, despatches, bills of lading and legal documents and only a very limited amount of literary texts. None integrated the reader as an active interpreter-analyst, but prompted him or her to retrieve simple accounts or information or to recall something that had earlier been committed to memory. Such things as legends, myths, incantations, chants and holy writ were still rarely written down, their veneration reserved for the `real' oral tradition. Preliterates and non-literates were still displaying prodigious oral feats of memory. Such ability had been innate, of course, appearing to be exceptional only to literates who no longer daily exercised humankind's natural oral talents. Oral ability weakens upon accession to literacy. Antiquity's first readers, accountants and bookkeepers, had begun discovering new strengths that then displaced the oral endowment. Favouring visual mnemonics, reading enabled memorization of higher-order structures and facilitated novel categorizing devices or techniques (such as alphabetic listing or acrophonic prompting) that augment the process of mental retrieval. With consonantal alphabetic writing's diffusion from Egypt, Sinai and Canaan, however, reading transcended that monopoly of bookkeeping scribes serving the rich and powerful. No longer requiring many years of intense study at a scribal school, reading could now be practised by all after only a few months of learning a simple alphabet. Its simplicity also invited borrowing by foreign languages, usually requiring only minimal conversion to convey indigenous sounds. In many different countries, people of all ranks and classes now learnt to do their own bookkeeping and to read anything they desired. Humanity's thirst for knowledge and love of learning served as kindling to incipient reading. Perhaps this need, not only to know, but to know more, prompted very early on the passion and respect for reading that was, in time, to overwhelm the globe. Humankind's latest advantage over other creatures has been our
42 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

ability to seek out and organize information. This occurred first through articulate speech, then through writing, then through ever more advanced forms and ways of reading. But literacy is a response; not a stimulus.60 Literacy does not cause social and cognitive change (though it is probably a necessary precondition for some changes). Once larger complex societies rise, literacy can enhance complex organization, primarily by aiding memory and providing access to knowledge (via files, archives, libraries) to a degree no human mind can achieve unaided. Those who read can extend their communication spatially and temporally; they can also expand their memory in compass and duration. Though the early scribes did all this in keeping records, exchanging letters, identifying commodities and even extolling rulers in monumental inscriptions, they seldom distinguished this faculty from oral performance: that is, the skills of the tallykeeper, messenger and herald. The appreciation of reading's real potential began very late in reading's development ­ in point of fact some three thousand years after writing's elaboration in Mesopotamia. With the written word's gifts came also its tyranny. As a result of their voluntary metamorphosis literates lost oral memory, oral culture, oral freedom. An artificial authority, the written word, imposed itself on every literate person: a human-created tyrant enthralling its devoted subject. Today, having entirely lost our oral patrimony, we are quite unconscious of the tyrant's ubiquitous levies as we live, think, believe, revere through the written word, oblivious to a world of other possibilities. We are, all of us, reading's unwitting vassals. Yet most people would accept that this is a small price to pay for one of life's greatest wonders: personal command over space and time. All of history's known languages and cultures endure only through reading, in this way continuing to participate in the human drama as they attest to the glory and struggle of our common past: Sumerian, Egyptian, Akkadian, Persian, Sanskrit, Classical Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Classical Arabic and hundreds more. For, over the millennia, the `immortal witness' eventually became humanity's own voice.

The Papyrus Tongue

At dinner, when my wife is present or a few friends, I have a book read aloud; after dinner a comedy or lyre playing; afterwards a stroll with my people, among whom are erudite individuals. Thus the evening passes in varied discussions, and even the longest day is quickly seasoned.1

The writer and administrator Pliny the Younger (c. ad 62­c. 113), known particularly for his voluminous correspondence, well appreciated reading's place in ancient Rome, at least among the patrician élite. This is because most non-essential reading, during nearly all of classical antiquity, was entertainment and announcement, read aloud by servants or slaves trained in the art. When Emperor Augustus (63 bc ­ ad 14) found it impossible to sleep, for example, he summoned, as his biographer Suetonius (c. ad 75­150) tells us, readers or story-tellers. All classical instruction had as its ultimate goal not so much the acquisition of knowledge as the perfection of eloquence. Greeks and Romans, after their respective archaic periods, certainly used writing extensively. But their daily lives were still dominated by the spoken word. They dictated letters, heard recitations, listened to news, attended their slaves' readings of literature and correspondence. Orality, not literacy, ruled ancient Mediterranean society. What had changed was that, with writing's sudden proliferation, Greeks and Romans of various ranks and classes were reading aloud from hand-held scrolls of papyrus (and from waxed tablets). That is, even masters themselves were now declaiming with a papyrus tongue. Of course, the vast majority of Greece's and Rome's populations lived and died with little or no use, even indirectly, of
45

reading and writing.2 The patricians who did make frequent use of reading and writing typically preferred using others for the task; they themselves, with no incentive to do otherwise, rarely advanced beyond only a rudimentary level of reading competence. From early in Greek and Roman history, daily intimacy with reading and writing certainly approached universality among this ruling élite who sought only `the noblest pursuits' in their readings, as the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (d after 21 BC) professed. But `widespread literacy' existed only secondhand, and among a very small minority ­ that is, the literate slaves who read to their semi-literate patrician mistresses and masters. Three millennia after complete writing's elaboration in Mesopotamia, reading occurred with a variety of materials. The Dead Sea Scrolls reveal that much writing in Middle Eastern isolation occurred on skins, though gold, silver, copper and bronze were also used for exceptional documents. Monumental inscriptions ­ eminently visible today, but rare exceptions in antiquity ­ heralded in stone. Of course the great majority of everyday reading occurred in the form of waxed tablets. Nearly all correspondence and daily minutiæ were recorded on, and read aloud from, these easily erasable surfaces, the raised borders and hard covers of which protected the writing inside. Even entire works of literature appeared in waxed-tablet format. But the king of surfaces was papyrus, imported from Egypt. Greeks had probably already used Egyptian papyrus at Knossos, Mycenæ and other early Ægean centres during the second millennium BC. But then the custom waned. Only around the seventh century BC did numerous Greek merchants and mercenaries, who were making Naucratis in Egypt a thriving centre of Greek commerce, encounter papyrus again on a daily basis. It was not until the Anabasis by the Greek general and historian Xenophon (431­c. 355 BC), however, that papyrus was mentioned by a Greek writer. Up to the mid-fourth century BC the Greeks in Hellas itself, it appears, `lacked a common, inexpensive writing material accessible to all'.3 Early Greeks wrote on whatever was available: potsherds, waxed tablets, skins of every sort, even sheets of gold and silver and thin plates of lead. (Lead was actually prescribed for incantations.) But as such materials were not conducive to easy and compendious
46 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

reading, few longer works were written down. As ever, one relied foremost on human memory. When papyrus became a more familiar, if still extremely expensive, writing material, however, the trade in it suddenly boomed, prompting in turn more reading and writing along eastern Mediterranean shores. Egypt eventually produced huge amounts of papyrus for the Greek and, later, the Roman markets. The demand maintained a complete industry along the Nile, sustaining thousands. Eventually a book trade in papyrus scrolls developed in Rome, with scores of publishers who, in turn, employed hundreds of scribes and illustrators. Still, few could afford to own a book (scroll). Libraries accounted for some sales; otherwise all copies went to extremely wealthy patrons. The prime expense was the papyrus itself: each of the many middlemen involved in its import from Egypt demanded his percentage. Nevertheless, once papyrus became a major trade commodity, books and reading become commonplaces along the Mediterranean, and even beyond.4 The papyrus sheets were joined to form a scroll, which had to be rolled open in order to read. Because of this, the publishing of lengthy works was rather `awkward', at least by our standards. In antiquity Homer's Iliad, for example, probably comprised 24 separate scrolls, as it contains 24 individual books; only much later, with the emergence of codices of individual pages, were such books within one work reinterpreted as individual `chapters'. Similarly awkward was the viewing of a papyrus scroll one sequential frame at a time, like `scrolling' down through today's computer-screen pages. Because of the ancient book's format, a reader naturally comprehended reading as something intrinsically sequential. But this uniquely fitted oral reading, which was necessarily sequential, too. The normally contiguous text (with no word separation, punctuation or upper/lower case distinction) followed the natural flow of oratory. The physical act of reading aloud parses the text into its constituent features, giving meaning to the tongue where no meaning is evident to the eye. Though punctuation was devised early (by Aristophanes of Byzantium, c. 200 BC), it was primarily used in ambiguous cases to distinguish the desired pronunciation and intonation in
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 47

public performance. A universal, standardized punctuation, such as may be used throughout a text in consistent fashion, only became fashionable nearly two thousand years later, after the introduction of printing in Western Europe. Now conveying almost exclusively meaning, not sound, punctuation has become fixed only within the last three hundred years. In an early form of textual separation, scribes wrote per cola et commata (`by clauses and phrases'). St Jerome (c. AD 347­420) was the first who described this method of segmenting a text, having discovered it in old copies of Demosthenes and Cicero, noting it `conveys more obvious sense to the readers'.5 With this, the text is divided into individual lines of coherent meaning, for easier visual recognition. It told the reader either to raise or lower the voice, in order to render sense through proper intonation. As an added advantage it also allowed easier retrieval while searching a text, something hampered by the commonly run-together writing of antiquity. Papyrus scrolls were stored in two ways: in individual round boxes, with each scroll sporting a separate label (Egyptians had had clay labels; Romans preferred papyrus, later parchment, labels), and with separate boxes holding different authors or subject matter; or on open shelves, with identification tags on the end of each scroll. Once parchment became popular by c. AD 400, with codices or bound books replacing papyrus scrolls, these were stored not vertically with spines showing, as we do today, but lying flat on the bookcase. Once learnt, reading cannot be unlearnt, and so throughout antiquity tyrannical rulers who failed to prevent literacy attacked what opponents or suspected foes were reading: the books themselves. From the very earliest days of reading in Europe, too, just as in Mesopotamia and Egypt, critical or subversive, but also introspective or merely philosophical, works of literature fed the flames of fear. In 411 BC Athenians burnt the works of the long-deceased Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras (c. 580­ c. 500 BC). Emperor Augustus banned the works of the statesman and poet Gaius Cornelius Gallus (c. 69­26 BC) and the poet Ovid (43 BC ­ c. AD 17): Gallus, creator of the Roman love-elegy, took his own life rather than quit Rome, whereas Ovid, Rome's most celebrated poet after Horace's
48 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

death, never secured a pardon from his exile in Tomi (today Constant , a, Romania). Livid that their fame was greater than his, Emperor Caligula (ad 12­41; ruled 37­41) decreed the burning of all copies of works by Homer (whose Iliad and Odyssey were the West's most copied books) and two of the deceased literary legends of his era, the Roman poet Virgil (70­19 bc) and Livy (59 bc ­ ad 12), the historian of Rome. (Needless to say, the decree was ignored.) Emperor Diocletian (ad 245­313) ordered all Christian books to be burnt in ad 303, so great was his fear of their challenge to his supremacy. Because local religion had predated the acquisition of the faculty of reading, with reading thus remaining alien to the celebration of the holy offices, reading did not figure at all in the various forms of Greek and Latin liturgy, which remained exclusively oral. Deities are never mentioned or portrayed as readers. As there existed no Greek or Roman `holy scriptures', so, too, were absent myths or depictions of Zeus or Jupiter dictating sacred scrolls, as one finds emerging in Judæa at this time. (After having borrowed writing from the Greeks, the Etruscans in their art, however, depicted several of their gods as either scribes or readers.)6 Even so, among the most cherished possessions of a learned Greek or Roman were books, which comprehended an ardour otherwise reserved only for family, spouse or lover. For many, books were even closer and dearer.

the greeks
Greeks had been reading since c. 2000 BC, when the idea of syllabic writing had arrived in the Ægean from cosmopolitan Canaan. A thousand years later, a consonantal alphabet was borrowed from the Canaanites' descendants, the Phoenicians, prompting the Greek scribes of Cyprus to elaborate a complete consonant-and-vowel alphabet (the way we write today).7 At first Europe's new writing system merely replaced the more cumbersome and ambiguous syllabic writing in order to write accounts, dockets and short correspondence, mainly on skins. But soon it was also written on vases, metals, potsherds and
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 49

other things, the texts growing in length. One of the earliest inscriptions in Greek letters occurs on the Dipylon Jug (c. 730 BC), discovered near Athens's ancient western gate: `to him who dances most delicately'. It is certain that lengthy texts such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were also written down around this time, probably on skins, though the oldest preserved fragments, on papyrus, date only from the third century BC. In Greek anagigno ¯ sko ¯ meant `I read' as well as `I recognize, I read aloud' and, in Ionian Greek, `I convince, I talk (someone into doing something)'. Reading's very definition in Greek still denoted, then, spoken communication, oratory and persuasive rhetoric. In the seventh century BC writing in the West took a decisive turn when Greek law began to appear in monumental inscriptions, endowing writing with a new social status. Surpassing orality, written laws became visible in public architecture for all literates to read aloud and share with others. However, as with the inscribed monuments of Mesopotamia and Egypt, the primary purpose of the public inscription was to be seen, not necessarily to be read. Presence alone bespoke authority. Of course, before 600 BC very few Greeks could read. Literacy proliferated in the sixth century BC when writing began to be used more widely in public and semi-public life: with the increasing custom of inscribing and displaying public laws, the minting of inscribed coins, the inscribing of black-figure vases and other related innovations.8 Though it has been alleged that, by 500 BC, the majority of Athenians, for example, could read the laws that were posted everywhere in their city,9 it is unlikely this obtained: archaic Greece was not a literate society. Certainly the rules governing Athenian ostracism ­ that is, punishment by temporary exile, voted for with an inscribed ostrakon or potsherd ­ suggest that around 15 per cent of the adult male population of Athens, at least from c. 480 BC onwards, had reached the level of semi-literacy, or perhaps even a slightly higher level, since many of these were clearly able to write competently for themselves. From this, perhaps around five per cent, or slightly more, of the total adult population of Athens, including women and slaves, was literate. In other words, about one out of twenty Athenians could probably `read' with varying levels of competence.
50 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

It was at this time, too, because of reading and writing, that the Greek mythic epic became divided in the public consciousness into the historical narrative on the one hand, and the work of `fiction' (a wholly new concept) on the other.10 Already about 700 BC the poet Hesiod had tried to arrange traditional myths in some sort of rational chronological order, one fitting a new appreciation of space and time and their role in the ordering of human perceptions. By the fifth century BC reading was no longer the monopoly of an oligarchy validating herein its power: it was rapidly becoming a `popular' tool for accessing information. The historian and politician Thucydides (c. 460­395 BC) was even trusting written documents more than oral traditions in compiling a chronology and account of past events, founding in the process the discipline of historiography.11 It signalled a paradigm shift in humanity's appreciation of reading's innate power. For one now realized writing could allow accession and retention of many texts, and to a degree that orality could never achieve. Through reading, a person could visually `become' a text and, with increased reading, even a `walking library' of multiple works. Until the end of the fifth century BC poets remained disciples of the Muses alone. But then the grammatikós or `grammarian' commanded the Greek language, knowing how to read and interpret a written text. It was in the lifetime of the philosopher Plato (c. 427­c. 347 BC) ­ the pupil of Socrates (c. 470­399 BC) and teacher of Aristotle (384­322 BC) ­ that the Greek language advanced to the point where one could begin to address abstract concepts adequately for the first time.12 Plato, well aware of what was taking place in Athenian society, documented these revolutionary changes in his celebrated Phædrus dialogue. This was the fascinating story of young Phædrus, at the end of the fifth century BC, demonstrating to Socrates this new ability of how one `became' a work of written literature. Having memorized a written work by Lycias on the duties of a lover (then a favourite theme), Phædrus wished to impress Socrates with its recitation. But Socrates, mistakenly believing Phædrus had hidden the written text under his robes, requested the youth read him the original instead, remonstrating `I won't let you practise your oratory on me when Lycias himself is here

present!'13 Lycias's work not only dealt with love, but also with the art of writing, leading Socrates to expound:
You know, Phædrus, that's the strange thing about writing, which makes it truly analogous to painting. The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive: but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence. It is the same with written words: they seem to talk to you as though they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything about what they say, from a desire to be instructed, they go on telling you just the same thing for ever. And once a thing is put in writing, the composition, whatever it may be, drifts all over the place, getting into the hands not only of those who understand it, but equally of those who have no business with it; it doesn't know how to address the right people, and not address the wrong. And when it is ill-treated and unfairly abused it always needs its parent to come to its help, being unable to defend or help itself.14

Socrates believed books ­ the objects themselves, not their contents ­ were actually an impediment to learning. There was only one `proper' interpretation of a text, he felt, one shared by those of trained intellect and communicable only by oral transmission. Too much is lost in writing. The voice alone conveys the `one, correct' interpretation. Socrates was demanding from the text the uni-dimensionality of orality that, within the next two generations, the interpretative reader was to transform into multi-dimensionality. Instead of recognizing this revolution in reading, Socrates, insisting on the inherited tradition, simply dismissed all writing. Socrates's position is neither an indictment of reading nor the last stand on the oral society, as some have alleged. It is chiefly a critique on the contemporary inadequacy of Greek writing to reproduce Greek speech, in particular the pitch stress characterizing Greek oratory. Socrates was right: the primitive early writing practices of his era did allow too much ambiguity, hindering communication. Since the beginnings of written speech, readers must interpret, either to retrieve the author's meaning or to understand
52 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

something new. This creative open-endedness simply did not exist in oral society, where meaning was immediate. Socrates wished to maintain the auctorial clarity of orality: it helped to define truth, which was, he insisted, `written on the soul of the hearer to enable him to learn about the right, the beautiful and the good'. One heard the truth; one did not read it. But to maintain orality was to deny reading's potential multi-dimensionality, which was soon to transform all of Western society. Socrates's pupil and biographer Plato endorsed his master's position. Plato rejected written philosophy, even advocating civil legislation to control oral poetry. Yet, as many generations have pointed out, Plato used writing to champion his cause. This has led many to believe that Plato was merely making a hermeneutic or interpretative appeal for writing's `proper' use.15 Plato's many written works attest to a conscious use of the written medium to hone and model thought itself, something quite new in the West: something entirely beyond the capability of oral performance. If Socrates had dwelt wholly in the oral world, his pupil Plato was very much a reader and a writer, despite the public mask. Still, Plato would ban the poet from his ideal republic. This reflected a general distrust of fiction in the West, which lingers still. Fiction is something to be feared, because it represents the unfettered mind, capable of anything. Knowledge is clearly something to be directed for the common good. But fiction, being directionless energy, has always aroused suspicion and invited censure. In actual fact, there were few written texts in Socrates's and Plato's Athens. Writing's full potential as a social tool was yet to be realized. A primitive book trade blossomed in Athens in the fifth century BC. But the private reading of books (papyrus scrolls) seems only to have become relatively `common' in the fourth century BC, the era of Plato's pupil Aristotle, born 15 years after Socrates's death. In contrast to Socrates and his generation, Aristotle became an avid reader. He even amassed a private library that he could use for his scholarship. The fifth to fourth centuries BC marked the transition from the oral to the written tradition (but not the oral to the literate society, the latter being only a very recent phenomenon).
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 53

As Socrates's own pupils Plato and Xenophon used writing to preserve their master's oral teachings ­ including his dismissal of writing ­ so, too, did the new generation of philosophers and physicians, like Hippocrates (c. 460­c. 377 BC), use writing to diffuse new knowledge in a way oral tradition had never done. In time this engendered the creative interpretation of written texts, expanding inherited knowledge's capabilities. The Greek physician, anatomist and physiologist Galen (c. AD 130­c. 200), for example, eventually wrote in turn of Hippocrates: `I shall interpret those observations [of his] which are too obscure, and add others of my own, arrived at by the methods he wrote down.'16 This of course became the very point of reading: to understand, learn from, then build upon a written text. By the fourth century BC, then, reading and writing were beginning to be seen in an entirely new light in the West. The Athenian dramatist Menander (c. 342­c. 292 BC) even maintained: `Those who can read see twice as well'.17 By this time the written word was often perceived to be not only on a par with, but superior to, the spoken word. By the beginning of the fourth century BC, `a certain number of men in Greek cities spent a lot of time with written texts, and many lives were affected by operations carried out in writing'.18 Writing flourished in Hellas chiefly because of papyrus, once the Ptolemies, the Macedonian dynasty that ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great (323 BC) to the death of Cleopatra (30 BC), had taken over Egypt and encouraged trade with the Greek city-states. Until papyrus, great works of literature often survived in a single skin exemplar. Aristotle's works, for example, were stored as scrolls in a cave and would doubtless have been lost forever had they not been purchased by an astute bibliophile who rescued them for posterity. Only after the fourth century BC, once large-scale importation of papyrus was enabled by the Ptolemies in Alexandria, did literature prosper in Greece, allowing many copies of a work, private collections, public libraries ­ indeed, a culture of the written word. The incipient book trade, which had begun in Athens in the fifth century BC, boomed in the third century BC once papyrus became commonly available. In other words, Alexander the Great's take-over of Egypt and imposition of a Macedonian
54 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Greek administration not only opened up the North African markets to European trade but, because of papyrus, gave rise to the power of the written word and the birth of written culture in the West, with all concomitant repercussions.19 By the end of the fourth century BC, the oral transmission of social knowledge had decisively become a written transmission. What was more, writing no longer merely documented and preserved, but legitimized and validated knowledge. One now composed specifically in order to preserve this poem or that teaching in writing. It achieved greater distribution and ensured authority. Reading was no longer a simple memory aid, but an autonomous channel for information conveyance, interpretation and creation. Greeks did not use writing with the ease and efficiency of the Egyptians, Levantines, Persians and others until the late fourth century BC. Even then (as later with the Romans) oral statements were considered equal to writing in most procedural matters. Whereupon Hellenistic Greeks, especially those ruling in Egypt, elaborated bureaucratic uses of reading and writing that far exceeded what had obtained in earlier centuries.20 The written word held entire states together. Even more importantly, elementary education now empowered society, as at least a few city-states benefited from individual philanthropists financing the attendance of all free boys (and, in some places, free girls) at public schools focusing on reading and writing Greek. Compulsory education for both boys and girls had figured as part of Plato's ideal republic.21 However, the philosopher Theophrastus (c. 372­c. 287 BC) countered that females were to learn only household responsibilities, as higher learning `turns a woman into a quarrelling, lazy gossip'. Although Greek courtesans and many female slaves might well have been literate,22 the typical female patrician, who would have had her female slaves read aloud to her, was not. The archetypal Hellenistic school always instructed far more boys than girls. Pupils began at seven years of age and graduated at fourteen.23 The teaching of reading followed an analytical method, which brought slow progress. First the Greek alphabet was taught, from alpha to omega. Then backwards. Then simultaneously, from both ends: alpha-omega, beta-psi, ending at mu-nu.
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 55

Whereupon more complex syllables were drilled. Then one learnt whole words, of one, then two, then three syllables. Vocabulary followed, including rare words (such as technical and medical terms) selected for their difficulty of reading and pronunciation. After several years, pupils were reading connected texts (first learnt by heart), which were special anthologies of famous passages selected also for their moral content: commonly Homer, Euripides and a few others. As important as reading was recitation, because reading always meant reading aloud. Formal rhetoric comprised an advanced study that built upon reading's foundation. Ancient Greek pedagogy was regimental, harsh and stifling. True inspiration would have lain elsewhere: in a kind tutor's lent scroll, a friend's special papyrus, a respected elder's moving oration. Private tutors instructed the scions of the powerful and wealthy. Through Aristotle's tutelage, for example, Alexander the Great became `a great lover of all kinds of learning and reading', according to his biographer, the Greek philosopher Plutarch (c. AD 46­c. 120).24 Wherever he journeyed, Alexander carried with him the scrolls of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and when he died at Babylon in 323 BC he was clutching one of his scrolls of the Iliad (similar to later generations expiring with a copy of the Bible or Qur'a ¯ n in hand). Such anecdotes of the rich and powerful testify to the growing reverence for the written word, which had become something personal and profound. The works of Homer, above all, became `a training ground where one generation of Greeks formed the character of the next until the end of antiquity'.25 (In similar fashion, Virgil's Æneid would, in time, become the same for the Romans.) It is difficult for us today to appreciate the depth of reverence in which Homer's writings, in particular, were held in antiquity. The earliest known public readings took place among the Greeks. Already in the fifth century BC, Herodotus (c. 485­c. 425 BC), the `Father of History', rather than travel from city to city to read his works, as was then customary, presented them to all assembled Greek men at the Olympic festivals. One must appreciate that the first public readings, both in Greece and Rome, still maintained that intimate connection between oral and written literature, in that the authors were presenting their own
56 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

works in a small society where they were also known personally. Each reader-reciter stamped a given interpretation ­ through intonation, tempo, emotion, gesture and other things ­ with a seal of authority as well, robbing the written text at the same time of its wealth of potential meanings. Entertainment, the sight and sound of a text, always dominated public readings. The text's substance was not immediate, the audience generally uncritical of everything but the performer himself: voice, passion, appearance, charisma. It was the world of oratory, of oral performance, with wholly other criteria obtaining than that of `reading' as we know it. It was the author-reader who incarnated the text, who thought for his passive audience. Physicians in antiquity even prescribed reading to their patients as a psychic exercise. This involved, of course, almost exclusively `being read to'. Many Greeks (and later Romans) kept a specially trained slave or freedwoman/freedman whose sole responsibility was to read to them aloud. These would have been particularly schooled in the correct scansion, pronunciation and delivery of both poetry and prose (two separate domains), as these features mattered as much as content. By the third century BC writing assisted every conceivable task in the highly bureaucratic, and thus well-organized and well-regulated, Greek-dominated society of Alexandria: vending beer, keeping a bath-house, accepting a paint job, trading in roasted lentils.26 Within just 33 days, for example, the finance minister Apollonius received 434 rolls of written papyrus to process. It should come as no surprise, then, that precisely where the papyrus trade first empowered the written word the ancient world's greatest shrine to writing rose: the Library of Alexandria.27 It was to become so famous that 150 years after its destruction Athenæus of Naucratis could still write, anticipating his readers' general knowledge: `And concerning the numbers of books, the establishing of libraries, and the collection in the Hall of the Muses, why need I even speak, since they are in all men's memories?'28 The Library of Alexandria was begun under Alexander's successor, the Macedonian Greek ruler Ptolemy I Soter (ruled 323­285 BC), probably as an attachment to the municipal
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 57

museum. At first the papyrus scrolls were simply stored in bookshelves placed in recesses stretching the length of a broad, roofed passageway. Each recess possibly categorized a given class of author, indicated by a clearly marked heading. In turn, each bookshelf would have been categorized into subheadings. The purpose of the Library, the result of Greek culture assimilating Egyptian antiquity, was to encompass the totality of human learning: it would represent the known world's memory. Even Aristotle's own book collection, in time, made it safely to Alexandria. It is alleged that by the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes (ruled 246-221 BC) no one person could read the complete holdings of the Library. Over a century and a half, the Library's collection expanded to include some 500,000 papyrus scrolls; a further 40,000 were housed in a separate depot attached to the nearby Temple of Serapis. It held the largest physical volume of literature the region had yet seen. How did the Library of Alexandria grow so vast? It enjoyed royal patronage, as an institutionalized national asset. Every ship that put in at Alexandria, one of the world's major ports, had to hand over for copying any scrolls it was carrying. Greek Egypt's ambassadors borrowed scrolls from other Greek libraries for copying. Whole libraries were purchased, others bequeathed. Many Greeks gave scrolls to the Library, while others lent theirs to be copied. Some fraudsters even sold Library officials apocryphal treatises by `Aristotle' (only centuries later proved to be forgeries). One drawback to such a vast collection was that no one could find anything, save through extraordinary memory, for as yet there was no efficient system of book cataloguing. The North African-born Callimachus of Cyrene (c. 305­c. 240 BC), teacher, writer, poet and epigrammatist, finally devised one of the world's earliest known, rational, cataloguing systems here at the Library of Alexandria, where he eventually came to work. An advocate of clear, concise writing, Callimachus, labouring under the Chief Librarian Apollonius of Rhodes (his opposite and adversary), undertook his task using a novel conception: the library as a model of the entire world, as perceived by the Greek scholars of the era.
58 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Once done, the Library's catalogue alone numbered 120 scrolls (Callimachus did not live to see the completion of his task). The collection was divided into eight sections, according to subject matter: drama, oratory, lyric poetry, legislation, medicine, history, philosophy and `miscellaneous' (significant is the lack of a separate category for theology, the Middle Ages' most important). Long texts were copied in several shorter `books', allowing the reader the ease of individual, smaller papyrus scrolls. Innovatively, books were listed in Greek alphabetical order (alpha, beta, gamma, delta and so forth); although known earlier, alphabetical listing had never been used to catalogue books on such a vast scale. Now, for the first time anywhere, a library was more than a depot of papyrus scrolls: it became a systematized information centre, since access had been acknowledged to be as important as the data themselves ­ indeed, the two in tandem were recognized to be of greatest benefit. In this way the Library of Alexandria became the Mediterranean's premier centre of learning based on the written word. All subsequent libraries were to follow the Alexandrian model. (We still follow the Library of Alexandria today, albeit in an evolved fashion.) At this time an entirely new literary genre appeared that, over the millennia, would conquer the world: the novel. One of the earliest novels to survive in its entirety, probably from the second century AD, begins: `My name is Chariton of Aphrodisias and I am clerk to the lawyer Athenagoras. I'm going to tell you a love story that took place in Syracuse ...'. It was the first great age of love stories, the type of tale that only much later would come to be known as the romance (a word derived from the Old French romanz, meaning `a work composed in the vernacular tongue'). Like so many popular works of today, the ancient Greek novel flaunted adventure and love. A pair of (typically) well-born lovers, suffering separation and misfortune but always trusting in the gods and themselves and preserving their mutual pledges of love, at last find their way back together and live happily ever after.29 Longus's Daphnis and Chloe, for example, probably from the first half of the third century AD, thrilled centuries of readers with its bucolic tale of two young lovers who struggle to realize their true love for one
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 59

another. (Roman patricians loved novels, too, especially in Greek.) The early Greek novels ­ never a greatly popular literary genre, to judge by the few surviving fragments ­ comprised apparently only light reading, primarily for entertainment, with a sophistication of language bespeaking an educated female readership. (Men, on the other hand, appear to have preferred the epic and drama: that is, warfare and heroes.) Such novels lost popularity between the sixth and eighth centuries AD, but Byzantine scholars revived them in the ninth to eleventh centuries ­ greatly influencing, in turn, Arabic, Spanish and then pan-European audiences. Contrary to what some historians have alleged, reading did not give the Greeks democracy, theoretical science or formal logic. That is, reading per se did not change the way people thought. It did, however, encourage more people to write about what they thought. And it provided an opportunity for these and similar predispositions to take root and flourish.30

the jews
Following the lead of the Greeks, the Jews of the Middle East had been among the first to appreciate the manifest benefits of cultural reading, perhaps as early as the seventh century BC. Unlike the Greeks, however, they came to enshrine the very act as something sacred. Babylonians and Assyrians had greatly respected magical texts. But this had been because of these texts' useful instructions for understanding the supernatural and exploiting its forces for personal health, wealth or power. The respect had never entailed veneration of the written word itself, that is, the sanctification of writing and its physical material. The Levantine Jews introduced just such a sanctification, thereby adding a whole new dimension to reading. 31 The written word in fact became fundamental to the Jewish identity. After dedication to God, learning (the reading and interpreting of `sacred' texts) is the Jew's next duty to his faith. (Jewish women were discouraged from, indeed frequently forbidden, reading and writing until only recently.) Reading and
60 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

disputing are held to be the way towards understanding of the divine. The chanted office, one common throughout the ancient Middle East, became a liturgy based entirely on written texts. The very act of reading such texts became part of the holy observance, the direct transmission of the divine covenant. This new concept, born in Hebrew liturgy, eventually inspired Christian Greeks and Romans, whose liturgy spread the practice, as well as the new dimension of the written word, thoughout the Western world. Christianity was founded on, and quickly diffused through, the Judaic exaltation of the written word. By then, reading had transcended even ecclesiastical authority. It had become the Word of God. Best accommodating Hebrew and Aramaic writing's specific Levantine ramification would be the recently proposed dating of the composition of the Biblical account of Israel's `origin and history' to the reign of King Josiah, who ruled from 639 to 609 BC.32 Josiah's court reinstituted the exclusive worship of the god of the Israelites, centred on the Temple of Jerusalem. Josiah's greater goal, however, was to expand his reign over all Judah and the former northern kingdom. Achieving this necessitated the literary creation of a coherent narrative of Israelite history as a clear instrument of God's will. If this explanation is correct, it would mean that the Pentateuch or Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and all the historical books of the Hebrew Bible are, in fact, political fiction, composed at a much later date than the events they appear to document. Such stories were meant to furnish Josiah's present and future subjects with a mythical past in order to create a national consciousness of `Jewdom', with its own unique theology. A fully developed national consciousness finally emerged only during the Babylonian Exile (597/586­538 BC) when Aramaic writing was also borrowed to convey the Hebrew language in hitherto unprecedented ways, or even later, during the Hellenistic period (332­63 BC) after the kingdom of Judah had become Judæa. The idea of writing being the `Word of God' had to be a late phenomenon, since Phoenician and Greek bookkeeping and administrative records would have been virtually all that early
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 61

Hebrew scribes had comprehended from the primitive practice. It seems likely that, at least for most of their early history as an incipient `nation', the Jews did not resort to writing at all. Only around the ninth century BC did the first Old Hebrew monumental inscriptions begin to appear, written in Phoenician letters. Whereupon the Jews began using writing with increasing frequency, but for bookkeeping, administration, taxes and the rare monumental and funerary inscription: all the functions of writing known to their contemporaries. But law was never scripture, for Hebrew law was customary law, and this was validated only orally by town elders. In Hebrew, too, as in all languages of antiquity, `to read' (qara' ) was polyvalent, with the additional meanings `to call, call out, recite, proclaim', again emphasizing reading's fundamental sense: `speaking aloud from a written text'. There was no single word like the English `read' that captured the act's uniqueness because, again, this uniqueness would not obtain for many centuries. From scribal accounts to `God-written tablets' embraced not a leap, but a veritable transcendence of human imagination. Yahweh's commandments to the Hebrews to construct the Ark of the Covenant in order to enshrine the miraculously inscribed Tables of the Law occur in Deuteronomy, which was apparently composed in the late seventh century BC when the Jews were creating their identity while collating an entire library of oral traditions that comprised many, often conflicting, genres from several epochs. It is this inspired confusion that informs the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, revealing many revisions and editions. Most ancient of all are the oral poems. The `Song of Songs', for example, reproduces the typical secular love or erotic song-poem of the late second millennium BC. Of similar antiquity are some historical events, which perhaps had first been written down in the Phoenician (and later in the Old Hebrew) script, in order to record the rise of the early Hebrew monarchy. Many written versions of Hebrew traditions competed with one another: there is evidence of robust literary skirmishes having taken place in antiquity. No writing was yet truly `sacred'. When all temporal power collapsed in the sixth century BC,
62 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

religious power filled the social vacuum, copying the mores, customs, even the script of the dominant Aramaic-speaking Babylonians. It was then, in the Babylonian Exile, that the rites of Jerusalem's cult were written down and the authoritative revisions of the priestly code were undertaken. This continued after the Exile as well until, by the fifth century BC, the Pentateuch or Torah stood in a fairly `authoritative' edition. Immediately predating the Exile, King Josiah appears, then, to have been the initial source of writing's first veneration among the Jews, introducing a new use of traditional writing foremost to acquire greater political control. He enacted legislation attempting to proclaim the Temple of Jerusalem the sole sanctuary of Yahweh. During this same process one of Josiah's secretaries suddenly `discovered' (c. 622 BC) the scrolls of the Book of Deuteronomy inside the Temple, these hitherto unknown scrolls being just that part of the Torah in which the laws defining the Jewish people and their duties and responsibilities are laid down. Here, too, Moses is claimed to have said (IV:2): `Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you'. Josiah gathered his subjects together to read this `newly discovered' work aloud, whereupon he convinced them to contract a new covenant with God. This was the beginning of a protracted process that involved sanctifying writing itself, something that had never happened before and only was possible now because of writing's recent commercialization, a more literate public and a new appreciation in the Levant and Ægean of the expanded cultural possibilities of the written word. This very late date of Hebrew consolidation, as recently suggested by `minimalist' scholars, certainly also accommodates most economically the known history of the emergence of a rudimentarily `literate' society in the region. Of course traditional Hebrew history, based on the Torah, would place the veneration of writing in the late second millennium BC, when Moses is alleged to have received on Mount Sinai the Ten Commandments, the miraculously inscribed Tables of the Law (Exodus XIX­XX). This is implausible, however, as the Jews probably did not possess writing this early. It is more reasonable
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 63

to expect such veneration to emerge at the same time that a semi-literate Mediterranean society was appearing. This occurred only around the middle of the first millennium BC. With writing's sanctification, the book also became metaphor. For it was in this momentum of creating a new Jewish history and identity through veneration of the written word that, in 593 BC, just three years after Nebuchadnezzar's first attack on Jerusalem, Ezekiel the Prophet beheld Yahweh mounted on his chariot, instructing him (Ezekiel II:8­10): `"Open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee"./ And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; / And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without; and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.' From a priestly clan, Ezekiel was well familiar with Phoenician and Aramaic literature. Through prophecies often reading like articles of Judaic law, he ultimately described his vision of the Temple of Jerusalem restored and the newly proposed `traditional' faith of monotheism triumphant. In fact, Jerusalem was destroyed seven years later, in 586 BC, whereupon all Jews were exiled to Babylon. After the Exile, having been influenced by cosmopolitan Babylon, the Jews had a new understanding of, and respect for, the written Aramaic word. Scribes suddenly took on a new significance in Jewish society as they redacted older Hebrew traditions and writings in the Aramaic that all Jews now spoke and was becoming the lingua franca of the powerful Persian Empire (550­330 BC). In the synagogues, the scribes began reading and commenting on what was only then becoming the Torah (still only the Pentateuch, the Bible's first five books), later to become the whole body of traditional Jewish teaching. The scribes became the key interpreters of the Law, the editors of the scriptures, commentaries and translations, the very spokesmen of Yahweh. They were also Judaism's prime readers. It was also after their return to Judah from the Babylonian Exile that the Jews constituted the sacred word. It was very much a Hellenistic-influenced process in a region now becoming Judæa, when Greek language, culture and customs came to resonate throughout all aspects of the new faith. The
64 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

traditional names of the `oldest' books of the Torah ­ Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy ­ are mainly of Greek and Latin origin, witnessing their late date of composition or collation. Almost all Jews, however, remained illiterate in antiquity, at least in Hebrew and Aramaic. (For commercial reasons many, however, read and wrote Greek.) For their sacred texts most relied on temple scribes or on their own prodigious memories. Only under the Roman Emperor Vespasian (AD 69­79) was the canon of the Bible, the list of sacred writings recognized as `genuine', finally a closed subject. Shortly afterwards, once Roman Judæa had become Roman Palestine, the Mishnah or approved commentary on the Torah was set down in writing. At that time reading in the main focused on these first five books of the Hebrew Bible. The oral and written commentaries known as the Talmud were written in later varieties of Hebrew (and in Aramaic). In the fourth and fifth centuries AD the Eastern and Western Talmud (the primary source of Jewish religious law, including the Mishnah and the Gemara) were put into authoritative written form, in tandem with the written codification of law that was taking place at the same time throughout the Roman Empire. Talmudists appreciated that the Hebrew Bible encoded a multiplicity of significances, the continuous study of which was the chief purpose of their life. The Midrash, that collation of scholarly essays addressing the holy texts' deeper meaning, alleged that the Torah handed to Moses by God on Mount Sinai was both written and oral at the same time; Moses had studied this during his 40 days alone there, reading the text by day and considering its commentary by night. The ethnic myth rendered the Torah not merely a monolithic perfection (as later mediæval Christians believed of their Biblia Sacra, and Muslims of their Qur'a ¯ n), but also an open-ended revelation: something always to be learnt from as society changed. In other words, a text could be both at once: the original (authoritative) and its interpretation (creative), with the latter endlessly supplementing and perpetuating the former. The concept also became Western Europe's, but this was not until the Renaissance.
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 65

Jewish veneration for the written word was taken to extremes in subsequent centuries. The sixth-century AD Sefer Yezirah ­ Hebrew's earliest extant text of systematic, speculative thought ­ declared, for example, that God had created the world with 32 secret `paths of wisdom' consisting of ten numbers and 22 letters.33 The physical world, time and the human body that comprised the cosmos's three strata were their direct product. All creation could be regarded as a veritable book of numbers and letters. Were we mortals to read the numbers and letters `properly', unlocking their combination in imitation of God, we could similarly give life. Indeed, after studying the Sefer Yezirah the Talmudic scholars Hanani and Hoshaiah were able to create, as one mediæval Jewish legend relates, their weekly dinner of a three-year-old calf!34

romans
Italy's Etruscans, inspired to write their own unique language for the first time using the alphabetic writing of their new neighbours, the colonial Greeks, never developed even a rudimentarily literate society. Instead, they kept their writing restricted mainly to funerary inscriptions, legal contracts, labelling of goods and possibly some administrative and bookkeeping tasks. In the first millennium BC this exceedingly restricted use of writing seems to have characterized all subsequent Etruscan-derived scripts on the Italian peninsula, such as that of the Ligurians, Lepontines, Rhætians, Gallicians, Venetians, Oscans and others. Only one offshoot of the Etruscan script succeeded to greater literacy ­ and eventually to immortality: Latin, as written and spoken by the inhabitants of Rome. The earliest readings in Latin consisted of owners' names on vases and metal objects, some religious dedications and a few short texts. One can assume that Rome's first kings and merchants made frequent use of waxed tablets for correspondence and accounts. Only during the fourth century BC, however, do more substantial inscriptions appear. By then, writing had also become `vital to the effectiveness of Rome's military and
66 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

political power'.35 Writing's functions broadened throughout the era of the Republic. In the late Republic, the use of writing increased exponentially, both in function and in geography, with the Romanization of the provinces that took place in the second and first centuries BC. Some recent historians have claimed that ancient Romans enjoyed `modern' literacy. But this is surely an exaggeration. Certainly, the range of writing in the Roman Empire was very great:
The Romans used written receipts and kept written accounts, wrote up political slogans, organized their armed forces by means of a mass of documentation, kept records of who became a citizen, circulated the texts of magical spells and books advocating religious beliefs, abused each other and protested love to each other in graffiti, wrote letters, and, in great numbers, commemorated the dead.36

Yet Roman society remained fundamentally oral, still perceiving reading to be an adjunct skill, not a primary faculty. Latin likewise possessed no single word that distinguished a unique act. Lego ¯ (`I read') equally embraced `I gather, collect; choose, select; peruse, scan; read out, read aloud, recite'. One could also say e ¯ volvo ¯ (`I read'), which further included the meanings `I unroll, unfold; peruse, study', deriving from the act of unrolling a papyrus scroll. Before 100 BC probably fewer than one out of ten inhabitants of the city of Rome itself could read and write, and throughout the entire Empire fewer than one out of 20 or 30 women. This was not a literate society. The Roman volumen or scroll, like its Greek counterpart, measured about 25 cm in width by six to ten metres in length, and was thus capable of holding relatively long texts. (In general, a volumen held about as much text as one of today's slim paperbacks.) This was the advantage of papyrus, which allowed lengthier works to be put into writing in the first place; until then, skin, wood, wax, pottery, ivory, metal, stone and bark usually permitted only brief inscriptions. Unlike the Greek scroll, however, which commonly descended the length in continuous lines (like today's PC screen), the Roman volumen was inscribed
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 67

perpendicular to the length, so that individual `pages' of writing appeared as one unscrolled. While reading, then, Greeks customarily held their scrolls with one hand over the other, Romans with both hands opposite each other. Each `page' of a volumen (each scrolled-open segment) had two parallel columns of 15 to 30 letters each in 25 to 45 lines, totalling between 750 and 2,700 letters per page.37 (Today's double-spaced typewritten page holds around 1,700 letters.) Typically, lines held a specific number of letters. The earliest papyrus volumina were written in clear, easily legible and even elegant letters for the most part, the size of which matched the scribe's fee. Each line of poetry contained an epic hexameter, iambic trimeter or dramatic declamatory verse, while any given line of prose had up to 30 letters. Such short lines helped the eye to identify the individual words, facilitating comprehension. Until the second or third century AD Latin writers separated words using two or three dots; whereupon scriptura continua (run-together text) became traditional. Though known, punctuation was never granted much importance. Pauses, used principally for oratory, were often merely a blank space in the middle of a line. As mentioned earlier, Greek grammarians had introduced diacritical marks ­ signs placed above or below a letter ­ early on, first to aid pronunciation and accenting (like actors' or newsreaders' cues of today), but then to distinguish whole words, sentences and paragraphs. The basis of all ancient punctuation was rhetoric, not logical analysis. (Today, punctuation is linked mainly to meaning, not to sound, the consequence of oral reading having become silent reading.) Reading a scroll was not a simple matter, for one had to unscroll continuously. Jumping backwards or forwards, or searching for a specific passage, was laborious. There was no table of contents, no index. To close the scroll in order to store it properly, one had to rescroll all the way back to the start. (To leave it open to one segment would invite damage.) And it was an extremely expensive, thus precious object, always demanding safe storage away from children, dogs, rodents, thieves and, above all, rain or spilt wine. If fire broke out in a house, volumina were of course the very first things one grabbed after the children.

Throughout the Empire, from Caledonia (Scotland) to Cappadocia (eastern Turkey), one read almost the same `hand', proof of an enormous volume of personal correspondence maintaining Empire-wide standards. An immediately recognizable Roman cursive became the common letter-shape. Within a short period only one or two strokes were used to form each letter in rapid succession, indicating very frequent writing. If writing had first served as an instrument of power wielded by a small oligarchy, it became in time, through continuing Roman conquests, commonplace in the administration and daily correspondence of an increasingly vast Empire. Though Cicero (106­43 BC) himself, the Great Orator, deemed that, for human memory, seeing a text was much better than merely hearing it,38 thus acknowledging reading's unique advantage in Rome's oral society, most Romans believed that human speech reigned supreme. Oral statements were equal, if not superior, to writing in most procedural matters. Indeed, the Romans in particular, far more than the Greeks, awarded speech a paramount importance in civic affairs, resembling in this more the northern Germans than their trading partners and subjects in the Levant, above all the Jews.39 Although their most visible reading today might be monumental Latin inscriptions, this self-aggrandizement of temporal authority comprised only a minute fraction of the ancient Romans' reading matter. At least where literature and learning were concerned, Roman reading meant Greek reading and Roman learning meant Greek learning.40 Only in later centuries did Latin authors, above all Virgil, achieve classic veneration. For all Roman pupils, however, learning to read and write almost entirely comprised learning to read and write Greek. Education itself meant Greek education. But unlike Greece, where only a privileged minority took part in a civic life that required a fairly high degree of literacy, Rome, beginning in the late Republic (the second and first centuries BC), had a greater representation of its citizens actively participating in forms of communal life demanding reading: posted texts of proposed laws and names of candidates for office, registers of declarations to the censor, voting-tablets obliging electors to write in a name, and other civic manifestations.

Rome was run by clerks and upheld by at least a partially literate citizenry. Indeed, it was perhaps the first `Empire of Reading', in that most patricians as well as a large number of freedmen, freedwomen and slaves ­ in Rome, the rest of Romanized Italy and many of the provinces ­ read and wrote on a daily basis. Unlike everywhere else in the world until then, including Greece, writing appeared nearly everywhere in the Empire: on coins, monuments, gravestones, altars at crossroads, boundary stones, aqueduct markers, milestones, not to mention the ubiquitous shop signs, posters, placards (carried on poles during processions) and graffiti. In Pompeii, for example, electoral posters shouted from public walls. (In the subsequent Middle Ages, conversely, such public writing was nearly non-existent.) Most families were their own bookkeepers. And Roman troops `had almost as much red tape as modern armies'.41 This is the lesson to be learnt from Vindolanda, a former Roman military base in northern England along Hadrian's Wall.42 Since 1973 some two thousand letters and documents on wooden tablets have been unearthed there, attesting to writing's pervasiveness in ancient Roman society. Comprising the largest archive of early Roman writings discovered anywhere, the Vindolanda literature dates from between AD 85 and 130. All inscriptions are written in ink or engraved by stylus on wax and convey the thoughts of ordinary men and women corresponding with each other on the base itself and with others far removed. The fact that such a trove, in such an isolated locale, exists at all testifies to the great amount of correspondence that must have been taking place among Romans throughout the Empire. At this time, writing maintained personal contact, ultimately preserving the social network and Roman culture even in primitive foreign parts.43 Such correspondence also secured military supplies and sanctioned orders, as well as conveying essential intelligence. In other words, reading and writing kept the Empire functioning. More recently other Roman sites in Britain ­ Carlisle, Ribchester and Caerleon in Wales, to name only three ­ have revealed similar caches of wooden tablets. It appears that, by the first few centuries AD, most literate Romans read aloud to themselves and wrote their own correspondence, as both the faculty and skill expanded beyond the patrician class
70 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

and milieu. Especially trained slaves and professional scribes and secretaries no longer dominated the ranks of readers. The large demand for papyrus scrolls, and later for parchment volumes, made books merchandise. Greatest in demand were Homer and Virgil, of course. As of the fourth century AD the Bible came to the fore, if at first in only fragmented, `unfinished' form. (A general rule for reading had been laid down in the second century AD whereby the most recent edition of a text was acknowledged to replace the edition before it. Only the most recent edition of a work, in other words, now contained the `authorized' version.)44 Still, even at the height of Rome's passion for written literature, books (scrolls) remained scarce. The imported Egyptian papyrus predominately bore accounts and records, authenticated documents and final drafts of official acts. Only the very wealthy could possess, much less amass, entire papyrus books. Most of Pompeii's and Herculaneum's wealthiest residences, for example, have revealed only a small handful of scrolls. This was because papyrus remained too dear. The marketed books of the Late Republic and High Empire were often shockingly shabby. In truth, only Senators and their wealthy relations could afford proper collectors' quality, and at outrageous prices. The New Testament (Acts XIX:19) chronicles that, at a time when one denarius was the normal day-wage, Ephesus's magic books were worth fifty thousand denarii. In a land where one drachma was worth one denarius, the Greek writer Lucian (c. AD 120­ after 180) mentions one rare book as costing 30,750 drachmas!45 Rome was of course the centre of book publishing, marketing and distributing for the Empire. Cicero's correspondent Atticus, for example, was also Cicero's bookseller; Atticus owned a complement of slaves who principally copied books in Greek for sale. (Occasionally Latin books were also copied.) A corrector, an early incarnation of today's copy editor, would be called upon to revise texts. `Press runs' could be quite large. In the first century AD the exceedingly wealthy, powerful and vain Marcus Regulus Aquilius, on the death of his young son, not only commissioned images of the deceased to be fashioned in paint, wax, silver, gold, ivory and marble, but he publicly read aloud before a large audience a biography of the boy, then had
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 71

scribes complete one thousand copies of this biography to be distributed throughout Italy and the provinces. Whereupon Regulus wrote to local officials to have them select a gifted orator among them to read the work aloud to assembled townspeople ­ which they did.46 Like today, bookshops were `popular' places in Rome, with wooden racks holding the latest editions of papyrus scrolls. Men of letters socialized with booksellers in the evenings and often visited their premises during the day. The booksellers had posters put up announcing new works; flyers were circulated to prominent addresses; sometimes extracts from the works were freely distributed to elicit interest. As provincial Roman settlements became cities in their own right, booksellers set up shop there, too, far from Rome.47 The poet and satirist Horace (65­8 BC), a contemporary of Emperor Augustus, boasted that his Ars poetica was now selling along the Bosphorus, in Spain, Gaul and Africa: truly an `international bestseller'. His contemporary Propertius (c. 50­c. 15 BC), the elegiac poet, was delighted to hear he was being read in northern climes. The Spanish-born epigrammatist and poet Martial (c. AD 40­c. 104) was proud to learn that among his readers were the young people and elderly ladies of Vienne in western central Gaul. His friend Pliny the Younger wrote to their mutual friend Geminus, `That there are booksellers in Lugdunum [Lyon, France] I had no idea, and so learn all the more agreeably from your letter that my books are finding buyers there; I'm pleased their popularity is maintained abroad that they've won in the City [Rome]' (Letters IX:11). Roman schools imitated Greek schools in nearly every way: they were just as regimental, harsh and stifling. Prefiguring what many educators endorse today, the Spanish lawyer and educator Quintilian (c. AD 30­c. 96), who tutored Emperor Domitian's grand-nephews and authored the celebrated Institutio oratoria, encouraged reading to begin as early as possible in a child's life, counselling:
Some hold that boys should not be taught to read till they are seven years old, that being the earliest age at which they can derive profit from instruction and endure the strain of learning. Those however who hold that a child's mind should not
72 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

be allowed to lie fallow for a moment are wiser. Chrysippus [d c. 205 BC], for instance, though he gives the nurses a three years' reign, still holds the formation of the child's mind on the best principles to be a part of their duties. Why, again, since [small] children are capable to moral training, should they not be capable of literary education? 48

Reading circles similar to those in ancient Greece appeared in Rome at the beginning of the second century BC. The earliest known was grouped around the famous general Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (c. 235­183 BC), who had commanded the Roman invasion of Carthage in the Second Punic War and defeated Hannibal at Zama in North Africa in 202 BC. This circle also welcomed and fostered authors who were not of the patrician class, promoted Greek language and culture, practised frequent and florid correspondence with fellow members and, when they met, sometimes exchanged nugæ or brief poems. Literary groups like these were usually the province of dominant women. At the time of Emperor Augustus in the late first century BC the foremost of these were Precia and Lesbia, who entertained, promoted and fostered up-and-coming authors, `managing' their careers in high society and steering them towards fame and fortune. Again as in Greece, public readings were fashionable throughout the Roman Empire. Augustus himself went to such readings `with both goodwill and patience'.49 Authors presented their latest verses, histories, stories, and their literary friends, fellow scholars or poets, as well as family, clan supporters and the general public would attend to loudly call out approval, clap at regular intervals, and jump up and cheer at particularly stirring passages. Such an audience reaction was not just a kind gesture towards a family member or colleague; it was actually part of the traditional etiquette, and expected. (Indeed, the lack of a demonstrative response by any party could be the cause of grievous umbrage.) All good writers anticipated constructive criticism at a public reading. Hearing this, they would then refine their work to accommodate the public taste. The audience was expected to arrive on time and remain for the entirety of the reading. The decorum was often abused, however, which
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 73

incurred the wrath of such traditionalists as Pliny the Younger. Readings were partly so popular because many of the wealthier patricians, who built auditoriums in their residences specifically for the purpose, believed themselves to be poets and writers of rare talent, worthy of larger audiences than mere banqueters. Nearly all of them performed only their own works while denying others the customary chair on the dais. More important than a work's substance was often the author's skill in oratory, since, like today, entertainment habitually outweighed inspiration. Pliny the Younger, our prime source for such information in the first century AD, praised young Calpurnius Piso, for example, for his superb reading of his Greek `Transpositions among the Constellations':
... a scholarly, illuminating essay. It was written in flowing, tender, smooth, even sublime distichs ... Appropriately and with variation he raised and lowered his tone, alternated lofty with simple, dry with sonorous, sober with jocular, all with equal talent. These were commended by his very pleasing voice, and his voice by his modest personality. His flushed visage clearly showed his excitement, adding special charm to the recitor. Somehow reserve suits literary men better than self-assurance ... After the recitation was over I kissed the young man long and heartily and ­ the sharpest spur of every admonition ­ encouraged him with heartfelt appreciation to carry on as he has begun.50

There were known devices one could employ if uncertain when reading prose but secure in poetry, or uncertain in poetry but secure in prose (both demanding different techniques). As Pliny wrote to the Roman biographer and historian Suetonius when he was planning an informal reading before a few invited friends:
Get me out of this mess! It seems I'm a poor reciter, at least of verses; orations are all right, but so much worse the verses. So I'm thinking of trying out one of my freedmen at the coming recitation among intimate friends. That also suits the intimate circle in that I've selected one who'll be not good but at
74 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

least better than me at reciting as long as he's not self-conscious. He is namely, as reader, just as novice as I as poet. But now I don't know how I should behave while he's reading, whether I should sit there dull and dumb as if the whole business weren't mine, or, as many do, accompany his recitation with whispers, looks and gestures. But I think I'm as ill-suited a pantomimist as I am a reader. I repeat once again: get me out of this mess! And write me forthwith whether it's better to recite poorly than perform these tricks or not. Vale.51

Pliny the Younger also recalled (Letters I:13) how Emperor Claudius had once been walking on the Palatine Hill, heard some noise and asked about its cause; told that Nonianus was giving a public reading, Claudius suddenly and unexpectedly came to listen. But in Pliny's days it seemed only those with too much leisure time on their hands came to readings any longer, and only after several invitations and reminders, while the majority never showed up at all. `I for my part,' he wrote to a friend, `have hardly ever let anyone down. However, these were mostly friends of mine'. The choice of what text to read in public was extremely sensitive, determined by rank, station, influence, political situation, sense of public decency and many other factors. Reading aloud was always a very demonstrative act. The material had to be socially acceptable. The spoken word was still inextricably linked to the literary text. There did not yet exist the independent domain of `silent literature' or `non-oral literature'. This limitation clearly comes across in Martial's mordant epigram:
The verse is mine; but friend, when you declaim it, It seems like yours, so grievously you maim it.52

The distinction also obtained in the celebrated phrase scripta manet, verba volat, which originally meant `writing reposes, speaking soars'. (Only in later centuries did it assume the significance `writing remains, speaking flees', a conceptual reinterpretation.) For in antiquity it was a reader's tacit duty to publicly exalt and demarcate the auctorial argument, not to sow a latently multifarious message. All written literature was
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 75

primarily, though not exclusively, for public sharing, to distinguish and thereby confine a writer's meaning. The `reader' was a transmitter, not a receiver. Public readings usually occupied only a few hours. Some lasted for as long as a week, however, their attendance assured by the fame or power of the author. Pliny the Younger attended one that lasted for three days, but probably only because the author, Sentius Augurinus, had begun by announcing:
I sing songs with short verses As once Catullus and my Calvus did And all those of old. But what is this to me? One Pliny alone is first for me ... How many Catos does it take for one Pliny! 53

Pliny listened `with the greatest pleasure, indeed with admiration ... I do believe that for a number of years nothing more consummate in this fashion has been written'. Such readings often became `examinations' for pretenders and sycophants vying for favour, higher office, a Senate seat or `mass' sales of their most recent poem or history. Readings proliferated in Rome, but not all authors were pleased by this development. Many resented that public readings became the only way to become known. And established writers protested that this profligacy of readings demeaned the custom's edifying function in society. Indeed, Pliny's contemporary Martial was so offended by would-be poets accosting him from all sides that he decried in one of his own poems:
I ask you, who can endure these efforts? You read to me when I'm standing, You read to me when I'm sitting, You read to me when I'm running, You read to me when I'm shitting! 54

How `popular' were writers with the public? Virgil, for one, was given a standing ovation one day when he entered the Roman amphitheatre. Among the graffiti found on the walls of Pompeii are lines recognized to be mutilated from Ovid. There
76 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

was a cultivated public of readers, to be sure, who knew books and read them frequently, despite their cost and rarity. Most reading, including public readings, took place in daylight hours, because of sight problems as prevalent as today's and because of poor illumination in houses, making evening reading difficult. Multiple candles, rush lights and oil lamps furnished enough light to read by, but most of these were far too dear for all but the most affluent households. If one could, one read in direct sunlight: usually in the open atrium or courtyard. Few, however, commanded such leisure at daytime. Poorsighted readers simply had their works of literature or account books read aloud to them by family, friends, employees or slaves. Like the ancient Egyptians and Greeks before them, some hyperopic Romans would surely have used polished stones to magnify the writing, while others simply used drinking glasses filled with water. It had been difficult for the Greeks to read on the kline ¯, the ancient bed. Though also used for leisurely reclining, the kline ¯ made it awkward to unroll a papyrus scroll upward with the right hand while the left arm was propping up the body; actually, no ancient illustrations or sculptures exist showing a person leaning up on a kline ¯ with both hands free, as we read in bed today. The Roman lectus, however, had many variants, one of which was specifically designed for reading and writing by the dim light of the lucubrum, the candle of wax-soaked cloth. In the Satyricon of Petronius (d ad 66), for example, Trimalchio composes on, then reads from, his pile of miniature cushions atop his multi-purpose lectus. Romans read whenever they could, it appears ­ often to the chagrin of their physician: Antyllus (second century AD) warned that people who never learnt verses by heart but resorted to reading them in books occasionally experience painful bowel movements because of excessive perspiration; people with a fine memory for spoken verses, he added, needed only eliminate these noxious fluids through normal breathing.55 The Roman statesman, philosopher and dramatist Seneca (c. 4 BC ­ AD 65), tutor and adviser to Emperor Nero, in whose attempted murder he was implicated, protested at having to study in his loud private lodgings. Martial relates how some went hunting carrying
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 77

along a scroll in a string bag. Horace visited his country house with literature in tow, as did the lyric poet Catullus (c. 84­c. 54 BC) when he frequented Verona. Roman booksellers even made special travelling scrolls since, just like today, many people enjoyed reading while on the move. The scrolls likely held works already committed to memory, however, their perusal allowing one to re-enact the public performance vicariously. Like Greece, the Roman Empire also had its libraries. The first Roman libraries mainly held Greek scrolls, as `proper' reading for any educated Roman was of course Greek, not Latin. Among the celebrated Greek libraries that the Romans had ransacked were the Royal Macedonian Library; the library of Apellicon of Teos (which Cicero later used in Rome); and the library of Mithridates, king of Pontus, who had been defeated by the Roman general Pompey and commited suicide in 63 BC. Many libraries filled private homes. Julius Cæsar's father-inlaw, for one, the powerful Lucius Calpurnius Piso, maintained an enormous library in his luxurious seaside villa at Herculaneum, on the Bay of Naples. Buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 and rediscovered in 1752, the mainly Greeklanguage library is the largest that has survived from antiquity, having thus far relinquished over 1,800 papyrus scrolls, including hundreds of hitherto lost works of Greek philosophy and a small collection of Roman poetry. Archæologists now suspect that a second library, on a lower level of Piso's multi-terraced villa, awaits imminent discovery. In the first century AD Seneca decried the fad of ostentatiously displaying one's domestic scroll collection: `Many people without a school education use books not as tools for study but as decorations for the dining room!'56 He further railed against the scroll collector `who gets his pleasure from bindings and labels'. In the households of these collectors, he fumed, `you can see the complete works of orators and historians on shelves up to the ceiling, because, like bathrooms, a library has become an essential ornament of a rich house'. The inflated Trimalchio in Petronius's Satyricon even boasts that he has `two libraries' ­ one Greek and one Latin! Already by the time of the historian Tacitus (c. AD 56­c. 120) many readers no longer sought the eloquence of a Livy or
78 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

Cicero, in which public oratory thrived, but the terseness, brevity and matter-of-factness of the scholar accustomed more to the study than the dais. Still, the new style exploited the techniques of skilled oration, revising them for a targeted audience of like-minded scholars. This produced a division among Roman readers. There were those among the élite who particularly enjoyed and encouraged this new brevity of style. Then there was the large majority of readers who preferred conventional rhetoric and bought those popular genres that used and perpetuated it. Some country houses in the fifth century AD held Latin classics for the men and devotional works for the women. The gender distinction is significant. Women were lauded as bibliophiles only rarely. One of the most celebrated was Melania the Younger (c. AD 385­439), who lived in Rome and North Africa and died in Bethlehem. St Augustine (AD 354-430) dedicated one of his works to her grandmother, also named Melania (c. AD 342­c. 410), whom he also praised in one of his letters as a formidable scribe, hinting at her writing talent. The Roman scholar Gerontius, too, recalled with relish how Melania the Younger `would go through the Lives of the [Church] Fathers as if she were reading desert'. Indeed, he praised her passion for reading:
She read books that were bought, as well as books she chanced upon with such diligence that no word or thought remained unknown to her. So overwhelming was her love of learning, that when she read in Latin, it seemed to everyone that she did not know Greek and, on the other hand, when she read in Greek, it was thought that she did not know Latin.57

Among the most highly valued books of antiquity were the three Greek books of the Sibylline Prophecies. These lay stored in a chest in a stone vault underneath Rome's Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Oracular women who divined in riddles, the ten sibyls ­ from Cumæ, Cyme, Delphi, Erythrea, the Hellespont, Libya, Persia, Phrygia, Samos and Tibur ­ were `immortals' whose words, the Greeks and Romans believed, held profound significance for mortals. Originally, nine scrolls of prophecies
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 79

had existed. The Sibyl of Cumæ had offered these to the seventh and last legendary king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus (616­579 BC). Twice Tarquinius refused to purchase them, and so twice the Sibyl burnt three scrolls. In the end Tarquinius bought the last three for the price of all nine. These were then held in Rome for centuries as `sacred texts', as with the Jews' recently created `ancient' writings in Judah, but with the important difference that the Sibylline Prophecies were inaccessible, being too sacred to display. Just like ancient Egypt's tomb texts they were, in fact, writings without readers. But this was just the purpose. Their inaccessibility imbued their owners, the ruling élite, with the nimbus of prophecy, reinforcing their power base. The last three scrolls were lost in a conflagration in 83 BC. (Twelve texts believed to be Sibylline Prophecies were discovered in Byzantium many centuries later, then collated in one parchment manuscript published, incompletely, in 1545.) Romans also knew divinations by text, whereby a reader would transform the written word into something neither the author nor society at large saw in it. The text became a private code, in other words, the secret symbol of a binary fortune: boding ill or good, depending on the reader's interpretation, needs or mood. This type of `reading' was exceptionally popular in antiquity. It was reading not for information, erudition, enlightenment or entertainment, but for fortune-telling. A surprisingly strong belief in divining by text obtained in antiquity. Indeed, some believed reading's primary function lay in just such magic. Cicero accused the augur (a religious official who observed and interpreted omens and signs) Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus of having caused in 162 BC `the resignation of the consuls at whose election he had presided in the previous year, basing his decision on a fault in the auspices [auguries from birds], of which he became aware "when reading the books"'.58 In post-Republic Rome readers preferred to use Virgil's poems to tell the future, randomly consulting those scrolls of Virgil's works available at temples dedicated to the goddess Fortuna. This practice, known as the sortes Vergilianæ, was first described when young Hadrian, desirous to learn Emperor Trajan's opinion of him, opened Virgil's Æneid at random to read that Æneas saw `the Roman king whose laws
80 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

shall establish Rome anew'. Hadrian took this to be a positive sign, and acted accordingly. But the Roman Empire never enjoyed such a thing as `popular literature', works personally read by tens or hundreds of thousands. One must even admit that antiquity's two favourites, Homer and Virgil, were almost exclusively learnt through dictation and recitation, not through personal reading. And those monumental Roman funerary inscriptions one still finds from the British Isles to the Middle East? Few such inscriptions were ever truly read by anyone; they were seen instead, helping surviving family members `to maintain or claim a certain rank or respectability'.59 The family members themselves need not have been fully literate. Particularly in later centuries, most were not. Mastery of the written word never had greater regard than among Rome's later emperors, who bestowed on learned teachers the highest authority. This was purposely done to uphold, in the face of barbarian incursions, the literate culture that Rome itself had come to represent, though not encompass. Valentinian I (AD 321­75), for example, emperor of the Western Roman Empire, engaged the Bordeaux-born poet and rhetorician Decimus Magnus Ausonius (died c. AD 393) as tutor to his son Gratian (359­83) who, in turn, once he became emperor, appointed Ausonius to be a Prætorian Prefect or chief magistrate. By then, civil administration was firmly founded on reading and writing. Greek law had furnished authentication of contracts by initially noting them on rolls, then by publishing them in official bureaus for all literate persons to read. About 500 years later Rome achieved something similar with professional scriveners or notaries who, over the succeeding three centuries, came under the supervision of public authorities. Once written contracts became common in the Roman Empire, however, Goths and other Germanic tribes invaded. Yet the system that had been set up functioned so well that the new overlords borrowed and used it, too. (In fact, this became the basis of the mediæval notarial system, which accounted for the greatest frequency of reading and writing in the Middle Ages.) The custom of publicly reading secular works ceased in the sixth century. This had various causes: the patricians vacating large centres, declining education, a weakening book trade,
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 81

Germanic incursions and other changes.60 The vernacularization or `fragmenting' of the Latin tongue was a chief cause. The Christian poet Sidonius Apollinaris (c. AD 433­79), Bishop of Clermont, who gave one of the last known descriptions of a public reading in Rome, complained of Latin having become solely `the language of the [Christian] liturgy, of the chancellaries and of a few scholars'.61 Greek readings were long gone. Public Latin readings endured only in the divine office of the Christian Church. But by then Patristic Latin ­ the Church's adopted written tongue ­ was becoming increasingly unintelligible to most Christians. It had to be interpreted by specially ordained readers who, in time, became a separate caste: the presbyter or `priest'. Yet by the eighth century even many of these presbyters no longer understood the Latin Bible, prayers or hymns they recited at the divine office.

late antiquity and early christianity
Clay tablets could fit in one's palm. Papyrus sheets could be joined to fashion portable scrolls. Both materials served readers well for thousands of years ­ almost perfectly suited, in fact, to their respective society's needs. Then something revolutionary occurred, prompted by a new need. Pliny the Elder (AD 23­79) tells how Eumenes II (ruled 197­158 BC) of Greek Pergamum in Asia Minor, wishing to establish a library to rival the Library of Alexandria, ordered a shipment of papyrus from the Nile.62 But King Ptolemy of Egypt forbade its export, desirous to ensure the Library of Alexandria's pre-eminence as the world's repository of knowledge. Forced to find an alternative, Eumenes ordered his experts to create a new writing material, then, for his library. Whereupon these Eastern Greeks soon perfected a technique of thinly stretching and drying the skin of sheep and goats. The final product of this process eventually became the primary vehicle of a new world faith and the medium of an entire epoch ­ parchment. As early as the first century BC Julius Cæsar had folded a papyrus sheet into individual `pages' for dispatches to his troops in the field. This practice eventually created the codex, a text of
82 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

pages written on both sides for turning, not scrolling. This appeared for the first time near the end of the first century AD, in Rome, its innovator unknown. The first to mention the codex, Martial praises its compactness and points out how it relieves library space. He also mentions its usefulness on a journey for, unlike a scroll, it can be read in one hand:
Homer on parchment pages! The Iliad and all the adventures Of Ulysses, foe of Priam's kingdom, All locked within a piece of skin Folded into several little sheets! 63

The earliest known complete codex or bound volume, discovered in the mid-1980s in the ruins of a fourth-century house at the Dakhleh Oasis in the Sahara, is an estate steward's fouryear record of financial transactions.64 Written in Greek, it comprises eight leaves with four holes (two above and two below) on the left side for the binding cords. Eminently practicable, it clearly served the steward as a durable and portable `pocketbook'. One can assume it typifies the codex format of the first few centuries AD. At first the codex, still of papyrus, was merely a novelty, an object of curiosity. Traditional works were of course expected to be on scrolls. But as parchment gained in popularity, especially when Christians favoured texts on parchment and physicians preferred the codex format because of easier referencing, the codex of bound pages became more fashionable.65 The earliest Greek codex on vellum (fine parchment prepared from the skin of a calf, kid or lamb) is a copy of Homer's Iliad from the third century AD, now in Milan's Biblioteca Ambrosiana; the Iliad could now fit in one parchment codex, rather than in 24 separate papyrus scrolls. As of the first century BC thousands of similar codices would have appeared. Perfectly suiting the codex format, parchment was not only much cheaper than papyrus, but also far more durable and resistant to insects and humidity. Even parchment, however, was too dear for most common purposes, and so the largest part of reading and writing still took
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 83

place on waxed tablets; nearly all correspondence and daily minutiæ were recorded and read on these easily erasable surfaces. Yet more and more parchment sheets were being bound together and sold to allow one to make notes or record sums in primitive notebooks or ledgers. By the third century AD such notebooks were sporting elaborate covers, even of decorated ivory, and were presented to officials on nomination to public office. As especially refined gifts of sophistication, they often included a personal dedication or even a poem inside to mark a special occasion. Makers of papyrus scrolls began favouring these notebooks pre-written with particularly popular poems or small collections of writings, to be presented, much like today's commercial card industry, more for the gesture than the text. In time the bound parchment codices became increasingly popular, and considerable commercial gain could be made from them. Soon the parchment format was rivalling the papyrus scroll for its relative lack of expense, ease of production, greater return on investment, compactness and utility of reading. Parchment had begun seriously competing with papyrus during the first century AD, but by the fourth century had almost wholly replaced it.66 (Papyrus's complete replacement finally occurred in the early Middle Ages, when the trade routes to Egypt were disrupted by the Muslim expansion, halting the export of papyrus.) But parchment was far from the perfect writing material. It, too, was expensive, requiring the skins of costly sheep, lambs, goats and calves. After the fourth century AD the parchment codex ­ or `book' as it came to be called in English (a derivative of Germanic bo ¯ka ¯ or `beech', after the earliest material of rune tablets) ­ remained Europe's preferred literary form. Throughout the Age of Parchment, as the Middle Ages is frequently called, parchment sufficed as a writing material, however, only because demand for writing remained low. (Once the printing press occasioned enormous production runs a thousand years later, expensive parchment was replaced by cheaper paper.) The earliest vellum books were usually of a broad quarto size, a parchment sheet folded twice into four leaves, or eight pages. Its name, quaternio, later inspired our English word
84 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

`quire'. The quire format remained a favourite throughout the Middle Ages. When putting together the quire sheets, book producers normally took care to lay them in such a way that hair-side faced hair-side and flesh-side faced flesh-side, as the two sides of parchment can differ greatly. In this way, two pages of uniform appearance met the eye: either yellow-yellow (hairside) or light-light (flesh-side). Greek books usually began with the lighter flesh-side, Latin with the yellower hair-side.67 Ever increasing use of parchment accompanied Christianity's growth: the first copies of the Bible were vellum codices, a practice that became traditional. Christianity secured the triumph of the parchment codex, indeed created the modern book. A relative late-comer, Christian reading was a direct, hybrid descendant of the Greek, Hebrew and Latin traditions described above. The most ubiquitous book in world history, translated into more languages than any other, the Christian Bible consists of the 39 books of the Old Testament (originally in Hebrew) and 27 books of the New Testament (Greek); the Apocrypha, a collection of other early Christian writings, also survived in Hebrew and Greek. (The status of the Apocrypha has been controversial since the Reformation, when the Vulgate was translated into vernacular languages.) The Vulgate, the Latin translation of the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek, informed the Roman Catholic tradition of the Middle Ages. As early as the fifth century AD, enormous Bibles and other sacred books ­ missals (prayers, rites and so forth of the Mass for a complete year), chorales (metrical hymns sung in unison) and antiphonaries (a bound collection of psalms, hymns and the like, chanted or sung in alternate parts) ­ were displayed on a church's lectern for several readers standing at a distance. Some were so large that lecterns had to be fitted with rollers. The purpose was loud communal reading, especially for choirs, to include as many readers as possible in the celebration of the Mass. (This practice of enormous books with large lettering for choral celebration has continued in the Catholic church up to the present day.) Here, the reader submerses herself or himself in the communal persona, whereby the act of reading becomes group ritual. It is wholly different from the silent, private,
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 85

intimate reading of the later Books of Hours (as of the twelfth century AD). The parchment codex not only allowed Homer in one handy volume. It expanded the auctorial potential far beyond anything the clay tablet or papyrus scroll could encompass. Now the authors of late antiquity, such as Augustine with his City of God and Confessions, or Isidore of Seville (c. AD 560­636) with his Etymologiæ, could undertake a voluminous work knowing it would be contained under one cover, that is, received and understood as a greater intrinsic unity. The new format determined the nature of creative writing itself, in other words, opening up a new dimension of cultural expression in the West. Not being a scroll, the codex could allow easy access to any part of the text for referencing. It also held four margins (top, bottom, left, right), which the reader could fill with glosses, annotations and commentaries, bringing the reader into the written material. The codex's format also prompted innovations in organizing literature: chapters now accommodated subdivisions of a work, and collations called anthologies held several works under one cover. The whole work was one compact body of information, no longer a sequential stringing-out of connected scrolls. A reader now held an immediately accessible entirety. This altered perception of literature has since prevailed. (Only now is `scrolling' returning, in descending Greek fashion, as the computer screen alters modern reading perceptions.) By the close of the fourth century AD the written word's prestige overshadowed oral soothsaying and oracular pronouncements. One now divined using both Virgil and the Bible, the latter practice eventually becoming `gospel cleromancy', still observed in some places today. Patricians continued to collect books to impress, a characteristic foible that had Ausonius mocking:
You've bought books and filled shelves, O Lover of the Muses. Does that mean you're a scholar now? If you buy string instruments, plectrum and lyre today: Do you think that by tomorrow the realm of music will be yours? 68

Even the Germanic `barbarians' were turning to reading and writing. Using the fourth-century AD Greek alphabet, Bishop Wulfila (c. AD 311­83) created `Gothic letters' in order to translate the Bible into his Visigothic language. Other Goths adapted Wulfila's script and wrote religious and other texts, such as deeds (actae), until the eighth century. Only a small number of Goths, however, ever read, these being chiefly churchmen. Reading never permeated Gothic society. Reading actually declined throughout the Roman Empire in every social domain but religious practice. Christianity chiefly succeeded because, being parasitic to Greco-Latin learning, it claimed literature as its own vehicle and thus appealed to the schooled literate. The Church Fathers of the first few centuries AD were all trained in rhetoric; they commanded the classics, then used their literary knowledge to persuade, convince and convert in service of the Church. Plato and the Stoics (who taught that submission to destiny and to natural law brought virtue and happiness) provided the most useful concepts and arguments for these men of learning who accomplished Christianity's `triumph' over paganism in the fourth century AD when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Fundamental to Christianity ­ a faith of reading ­ was the body of writing later called the New Testament. The earliest dated `book' of the New Testament is Paul's letter to the Thessalonians, from AD 50. About four to seven years later, the First Letter to the Corinthians followed, at which time, during Emperor Nero's reign (AD 54­68), Christianity was already being practised as a faith in small cells throughout the Mediterranean. One century later, the Greek Irenæus, Bishop of Lyon, wrote of the composition of the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John):
Thus Matthew published among the Hebrews and in their own language [i.e. Aramaic] a written form of Gospel in the epoch in which Peter and Paul were evangelizing Rome and founding the church there. After their death Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, also transmitted to us in writing what Peter preached. Luke, the companion of Paul,
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 87

consigned in a book the Gospel that the latter preached. Then John, the disciple of the Lord, the very one who had rested on his bosom, also published the Gospel while he was sojourning in Ephesus in Asia.69

Within a span of around 30 years, then, it appears the oral traditions surrounding the life and teachings of Jesus, and the subsequent activities of his disciples and other followers, became a codified collection of texts circulated among the cells of believers to spread the faith through reading and writing. Yet much more remained oral, and was never written down. That the Gospels comprised only a fragment of the much larger oral literature circulating about Jesus was affirmed by John: `And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written' (John XXI:25). There was no need to write them down, for the target audience required quality, not quantity: the essence of the faith, to inspire and convert. In this tone, and with this editing in mind, the New Testament was collated. True `Scripture' remained, for all early Christians, the Old Testament. The veneration of the New Testament, still awaiting sacred status, would come only much later. Even the first Christians practised censorship. When Paul came to Ephesus and preached there for more than two years, the Jews and Greeks were enthused, especially by Paul's healings, and eventually `Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed' (Acts XIX:19-20). A fortune in rare books (since one piece of silver was a day's wage) was burnt on account of religious conviction as a public show of faith: one burnt the book, the pagan belief, as one would burn an enemy, to destroy the competition and erase its knowledge from memory. In time, the Romans turned censorship against the Christians. Yet once Christianity became the state religion, Emperor Constantine, after the Council of Nicæa's condemnation of Arius and his doctrine in AD 325, ordered in turn that all of the Arian sect's books be burnt.

Reversing Greco-Roman tradition, early Christians handed the book to God the Father, God the Son and the holy saints. Even the writings of Paul were regarded as authority, able to stand in court in good stead. When the Governor of Roman Africa was trying some Christians, for example, he asked what they had to defend themselves. `Texts by Paul', they replied, `a just man'.70 That the `impediment to learning', writing, could have replaced legal rhetoric itself, would have astounded Socrates. The Church Fathers were insatiable readers and prolific writers. St Epiphanius (d AD 403) ascribed two thousand original titles to Origen of Alexandria (c. AD 185­c. 254), while St Jerome listed Epiphanius' own 800 titles. Wealthy benefactors endowed these super-scholars with a guaranteed income, residence and small army of secretaries and scribes. Their rapid dictations were legendary. For example, St Jerome was said to have translated the Book of Tobit in one day and the Book of Esther in one night. One of the greatest influences on the written word in the West was St Augustine of Hippo. An impassioned reader as a young man, he was amazed at the mnemonic abilities of a schoolmate who was capable of quoting the penultimate verse of each book of Virgil `quickly, in order and from memory ... If we then asked him to recite the verse before each of those, he did. And we believed that he could recite Virgil backwards ... If we wanted even prose passages from whatever Cicero oration he had committed to memory, that also he could do.' Indeed, Augustine claimed, borrowing a favourite phrase from Cicero, this young scholar was capable of impressing a read text `on the wax tablets of memory'.71 Augustine held that letters of the alphabet were `signs of sounds' that also were `signs of things we think'. For him, such letters had been `invented so that we might be able to converse even with the absent'.72 Reading was thus a conversation with the absent, hearing the spoken word of someone who was not present. Hearing is the pivotal concept here. For with Augustine we first encounter a clear distinction between loud reading and silent reading: between the written word as the human voice and the written word as its own medium. When thirty years of age, in AD 384, Augustine came upon his teacher St Ambrose (c. 340­97), Bishop of Milan, silently reading to himself:
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 89

... when he was reading, he drew his eyes along over the leaves, and his heart searched into the sense, but his voice and tongue were silent. Oft-times when we were present ... we still saw him reading to himself, and never otherwise ... But with what intent soever he did it, that man certainly had a good meaning in it.73

It appears that silent reading was something surprisingly rare at the time, otherwise Augustine would never have made such a comment. Some scholars hold that `ancient books were normally read aloud, but there is nothing to show that silent reading of books was anything extraordinary'.74 However, only a handful of passages in antiquity attest to silent reading.75 For example, in Euripides' Hippolytus (fifth century BC) Theseus silently reads a letter his dead wife is holding. In Aristophanes' The Knights (fifth century BC) Demosthenes wordlessly regards a writing tablet that an oracle had sent, and shows surprise at its contents. Plutarch describes in his Parallel Lives how, in the fourth century BC, Alexander the Great silently reads a letter from his mother while his troops, watching, were amazed by the ability. In his Moralia, Plutarch further writes of Alexander breaking the seal of a confidential letter from his mother and beginning silently to read to himself, whereupon his bosom friend Hephæstion comes up to silently read the letter alongside.76 Plutarch records, too, how Julius Cæsar, alongside his rival Cato in the Senate in 63 BC, mutely read a short love letter from Cato's sister.77 (Here, the ostentatious act of silent reading, which was Cæsar's ruse, aroused Cato's suspicion, who announced a conspiracy; Cæsar was `compelled', then, to reveal the love letter from Cato's sister, doubly humiliating his rival ­ Cæsar's intention all along.) Providing consolation to the deaf in one of his essays, Cæsar's contemporary Cicero offered the advice: `If they happen to enjoy recitations, they should first remember that before poems were invented, many wise men lived happily; and second, that much greater pleasure can be had in reading these poems than in hearing them'.78 In the second century AD, the Greek astronomer, mathematician and geographer Ptolemy
90 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

noted that people occasionally read silently to themselves when concentrating on a subject, as giving voice to the words distracted from thought.79 In a lecture perhaps delivered during Lent in AD 349, St Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315­86) appealed to his women parishioners, while they were waiting during the ceremonies, to read `quietly, however, so that, while their lips speak, no other ears may hear what they say'.80 The passage is remarkable in three ways. First, it describes a silent mouthing of written language; even today, when reading difficult material, people often move their lips, as if the phonology were needed in order to assist comprehension. In the fourth century such mute mouthing may have been needed to parse, or segment, the run-together words on the page. (Regular word separation did not become common again until the ninth century AD; shortly after this silent reading became common, chiefly prompted by regular word separation.) Second, each woman parishioner is able to read, revealing a surprising degree of literacy among Jerusalem's Christian females. And third, each appears to possess a prayer book or hymnal: it was a rich parish indeed that could afford private books. Augustine speculated about Ambrose's silent reading: `Perhaps he was afraid that if he read out loud, a difficult passage by the author he was reading would raise a question in the mind of an attentive listener, and he would then have to explain what it meant or even argue about some of the more abstruse points'.81 In other words, silent reading protected Ambrose from interruption, thus permitting a one-to-one, more profound relationship with the written text. Augustine's speculation suggests his own intimate appreciation of reading's individualistic potential, one that would only become universal during the Middle Ages. Augustine himself, despite his surprise at his teacher's ability, read silently on occasion. At a moment of great personal turmoil, Augustine, who had been reading aloud Paul's Epistles to his friend Alypius in Augustine's summer garden but had walked away to weep alone, overheard a child chanting the refrain tolle, lege (`take up and read').82 Inspired, Augustine returned to Alypius to seize the book and wordlessly read to himself ­ and
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 91

`the darkness of doubt' was dispelled. When Alypius asked what had moved him, Augustine, who had closed the book on one finger, opened the text and Alypius read, aloud this time, not Augustine's passage but one further along that moved Alypius equally strongly. Augustine loved Latin, his native tongue, but resented Greek. Because of Augustine's influence on Christianity, his was the major contribution in the shift from Greek to Latin reading in the West, setting the foundation for what has been labelled the `Latin Middle Ages'. Of course Greek continued to thrive after Augustine, mainly for the Byzantine Empire and its impact on Arab scholarship. But Greek was to remain, at least in Western Europe, secondary to Latin forever after. Christianity's earliest known library appeared in Rome's church of S Lorenzo, founded by Pope Damasus I some time in the 380s. It housed the various books of the Bible, biblical commentaries, works of the Greek apologists (who defended by written argument the Christian faith against Rome's earlier belief system), as well as a selection of Greek and Latin classics. The position of pre-Christian literature in the early Church was often simply a matter of taste. Sidonius even chided a friend for having separated his library into classical and Christian authors, the former next to the gentlemen's seats, the latter next to the ladies' seats!83 Most early Church Fathers found Greek and Latin classics to be eminently readable, as their works seemed to prefigure Christian teachings. Indeed, in his De doctrina christiana Augustine claimed authors like Aristotle and Virgil had `unjustly possessed the truth'. The entire legacy of classical antiquity was now borne by the new Christian Church. As of the fifth century AD this was becoming missionary and monastic. Reading featured prominently, as each Christian monk was to devote many hours a day, if possible, to reading Scripture. Instrumental in the emergent institutionalization of reading was St Benedict of Nursia (c. 480­c. 547), who founded a monastery at Monte Cassino (c. 529), on a hill between Naples and Rome. Among the many rules that Benedict laid down for his `Benedictines' to follow ­ the written code meant to preclude the pre-eminence of any abbot ­ was this addressing reading:
92 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

At the meal time of the brothers, there should always be reading; no one may dare to take up the book at random and begin to read there; but he who is about to read for the whole week shall begin his duties on Sunday. And, entering upon his office after Mass and Communion, he shall ask all to pray for him, that God may avert from him the spirit of elation. And this verse shall be said in the oratory three times by all, he however beginning it: `O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise'. And thus, having received the benediction, he shall enter upon his duties as reader. And there shall be the greatest silence at table, so that no whispering or any voice save the reader's may be heard. And whatever is needed, in the way of food, the brethren should pass to each other in turn, so that no one need ask for anything.84

Benedict's Regula monachorum was to become the model Rule of all monastic orders in Western Christendom. Benedict stipulated three hours of daily reading in summer, two in winter. During Lent, the 40 weekdays commemorating Jesus's fasting in the wilderness, each monk was to read one complete volume. On any journey, a monk was to carry along a small book. And during all meals and before compline (the last of the seven canonical hours, just before retiring) monks were of course to be read to: a rhythmical, chant-like style of reading intended to exercise the mind and to commit holy texts to memory. Benedict also instructed his monks to hold, if possible, the books they were reading `in their left hands, wrapped in the sleeve of their tunics, and resting on their knees; their right hands shall be uncovered with which to grip and turn the pages'. Benedict's reading at Monte Cassino, and at all subsequent foundations that followed his Rule, reversed the customary practices of secular reading. This was special reading, in that it comprised limited titles and addressed a unique, confined audience. It was exclusively sacred, authoritative and involuntary, whereby emotions and critical faculties were banned. Some of it was private and silent: tacite legere or legere sibi, to use Benedict's own phrases. Most was public and loud, however: not to learn
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 93

and grow, nor even to be entertained, but to lose oneself in the common indoctrination. It was not individual liberation, but communal submersion, not unlike the text-read megaphone indoctrination of twentieth-century labour camps. It is not surprising, then, to find the repeated mastication of divine fare as a frequent metaphor in Christian writings of the era.85 The Roman statesman Cassiodorus (c. 490­c. 585) retired in his early sixties to found a monastery at Vivarium in Calabria, where, unlike Benedict, he encouraged fellow monks to read both the classics and sacred writings. Still, he emphasized the classics should be read only as a means to better understand the Bible and Church Fathers. Towards this end Cassiodorus had books imported from North Africa, then a great centre of the early Church, which he stored at his monastery in nine large cabinets.86 Pictures, too, were often `read' as symbols in antiquity and early Christianity. The picture of a deity's attribute would stand for the deity herself or himself. In this way, the hearth was Vesta, the herald's staff and winged travelling-cap were Mercury, the lightning bolt was Jupiter, and so forth. Animals could also become a god's symbol, such as the eagle for Jupiter. Scenes from literature adorned wealthy patricians' walls, reminding them of favourite passages from, most commonly, Homer and Virgil. Through such scenes, the non-reader ­ a learned listener who was often as versed as any literate ­ would recall line and verse the moment the eye took it in. This, too, was a frequent form of `reading', as it evoked the spoken language, though not through written symbols. In the first or second century AD scenes depicting episodes in Jesus's life were doubtless adorning early Christians' walls, too. The early Church also adopted Roman iconographic practices, using symbols for attributes, such as the Evangelists John, Mark and Luke as the eagle, lion and bull, respectively, or the dove for the Holy Spirit and the lamb for Christ. The substitutions later took on individual qualities: the lamb was no longer only Christ, but Christ's sacrificial quality; the dove was no longer only the Holy Spirit, but the quality of eternal redemption.87 The images swelled with the centuries, so that a vast `lexicon' of Christian concepts was expressed through
94 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

them. The Old Testament could thus be related and linked to the New Testament, continuing the policy of spiritual continuity the early Church had followed textually. As St Augustine had affirmed: `The New Testament lies hidden in the Old, while the Old is disclosed in the New'. One of the earliest examples of Christian iconography linking Old and New Testament scenes to be `read' simultaneously appears on two door panels in the church of S Sabina, Rome, carved c. 430. Anyone familiar with the Bible would immediately recognize here the miracles of Christ opposite those of Moses. Those not familiar would either have to invent a story or ask someone what it told. Over the centuries curiosity won countless converts. For this reason, when asked for advice about decorating a church St Nilus of Ancyra (d c. AD 430) suggested Bible scenes on either side of the Holy Cross, which would `serve as books for the unlearned, teach them scriptural history and impress on them the record of God's mercies'.88 The practice has continued up to the present day. Written culture in antiquity was generally restricted to a small number of privileged persons. None the less, in cities with large populations (such as Rome, with around half a million inhabitants) there were thousands who read, wrote, listened and actively participated in and benefited from written language. Throughout antiquity, reading and writing coexisted with all aspects of traditional oral culture. Those who could read and write widened pre-existent class differences, as they also participated in and contributed to civic management, military command and expansion of empire. After Greece's and Rome's archaic periods, the privileged class came to depend on reading and writing. Everyone else in society surely felt their effect. Yet the oral dictate so prevailed that reading was universally perceived as nothing more than written speech, a sophisticated form of hearing. Reading's true potential mostly lay unrecognized. Human memory was more actively cultivated and relied on. And it was extremely expensive to own books in antiquity ­ and difficult, too, if one did not live in a metropolis. Even fully literate Greeks and Romans seldom owned papyrus scrolls or parchment codices, and thus only
t h e p a p y r u s t o n g u e . 95

infrequently arrived at, through personal reading, a knowledge of the greater world or innovative thought. Nearly all literate Greeks and Romans used their ability to read and write to keep accounts, follow local elections, carry on correspondence and a number of other things that only rarely included literature. Because of these circumstances, one certainly cannot speak of mass literacy in antiquity. The literate society still lay nearly two thousand years distant. Still, many acknowledged literacy's primacy. A contemporary of Emperor Augustus, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, for one, had to confess that
it is by means of [literacy] that the most important and the most useful of life's business is completed ­ votes, letters, testaments, laws, and everything else which puts life on the right track. For who could compose a worthy encomium of literacy? For it is by means of writing alone that the dead are brought to the minds of the living, and it is through the written word that people who are spatially very far apart communicate with each other as if they were nearby. As to treaties made in time of war between peoples or kings, the safety provided by the written word is the best guarantee of the survival of the agreement. Generally it is this alone which preserves the finest sayings of wise men and the oracles of the gods, as well as philosophy and all of culture, and hands them on to succeeding generations for all time. Therefore, while it is true that nature is the cause of life, the cause of the good life is education based on the written word.89

The finest literary productions, written in the most sophisticated scripts, were undertaken for Homer in Greek and for Virgil in Latin for many centuries on papyrus scrolls. The Biblia Sacra, the Latin Bible, in a vellum codex, superseded these within the first few centuries of the Christian Church. Such publications were more highly valued and better looked after than others, and large numbers of them were produced.90 Testifying to the increasing sophistication of the written word and the society it served, oral poetry became literary poetry already in antiquity. Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, for example, are
96 . a h i s t o r y o f r e a d i n g

`primary' or oral epics: their original purpose being recitation, their principal attributes were construction, narrative appeal and story presentation. Virgil's Æneid, on the other hand, is a `secondary' or literary epic, its principal attributes lying in the individuality and grandeur of literary style and diction. This was clearly the consequence of reading and writing on a grand scale, undertaken by the thousands of literates in ancient Rome. Such a literary, as opposed to oral, composition also informed the New Testament, the hybrid product of Greek and Jewish traditions. The New Testament came to experience among Christians a similar veneration to that of the Jews towards the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible. Transposed to and transformed on the Italian peninsula, this veneration for sacred scripture set the foundation for the Latin Middle Ages. Classical texts seem verbose to us today, and with good reason. They are, by all modern standards, bombastic, pretentious, disorganized, repetitious, even scattered, filled with digressions and incidentals. For it is the literature of a speechbased, not a text-based, society. Orator-authors prioritized other things, their audiences comprising more listeners than readers. To enjoy these texts today we should actually read them aloud with gesticulations, perhaps imagining before us an atrium filled with smiling toga-clad relatives, nodding wellwishers and cheering sycophants. And ecce: the text suddenly springs to life. It was only in the later centuries of antiquity ­ when Greek, Jewish and Latin cultures informed the `Christian culture' that would infuse the Middle Ages with other values, priorities and practices ­ that reading turned more introspective and silent, the private pursuit, the inner quest. As early Greeks and Romans had experienced the `papyrus tongue' that transformed reading into a popular oral tool for accessing information, their descendants came to know the `parchment eye' that imparted Faith itself in solitary silence. Yet beyond the Mediterranean's sway lay an entire world of reading.

Scissorizing and Scrapbooks: Nineteenth-Century Reading, Remaking, and Recirculating

Ellen Gruber Garvey

Everyone who takes a newspaper . . . will often regret to have it torn up, on account of some little scrap in it which was of importance to them. . . . If you will hoard these rare gems, year after year, you will garner up a treasure-book that will not only be of service to yourself, but also to your children and grandchildren, in decades of years yet to come.1

and sister making scrapbooks together. The children took old bound volumes of Reports of proceedings of agricultural and horticultural societies and pasted over them: "We seemed to feel it laid on us to preserve the literature of newspapers and magazines from utter oblivion by entombing it in the sarcophagus of a scrapbook. I think each of us had at least one to his credit annually." The children vied for desirable printed matter to use in their books. "A hazy aunt somewhere subscribed for Our Young Soldiers for John," writes Lynn, and "[e]xcept for the pleasure of having it come addressed to him, he did not care much for it, and generously allowed us to read it freely. . . . But on these occasions he claimed everything usable in it, and only flung us the hacked and rifled remains." Choosing between articles on opposite sides of the same sheet posed difficulties: "Which should be saved for immortality and which should be lost forever in the pasty act of adhesion?"2 Michel de Certeau's metaphor poaching to describe readers' appropriations of texts to their own uses and meanings would seem a particularly apt description of the Lynn children at work. De Certeau distinguishes readers from writers, who are "founders of their own place . . . diggers of wells and builders of houses." Readers instead "move across lands belonging to someone else, like nomads poaching their way across fields they did not write, despoiling the wealth of Egypt to enjoy it themselves."3 De Certeau's poaching is an act of despoiling, in which a reader runs over one text to place his or her own ideas

In a 1914 memoir of a Missouri valley childhood, Margaret Lynn recalled her brothers

in it, yet after de Certeau's reader is done with the page, the text remains intact, available to its next poachers. His metaphor for reading is more literally descriptive of scrapbook making: The scrapbook maker actually despoils--clipping a paper full of holes, and as in the case Lynn describes, pasting over another work. In his work on Star Trek fans, Henry Jenkins has corrected de Certeau's conception, pointing to its mistaken teleology, its implication of a "correct" reading that poachers violate, as well as to its neglect of community building potential, as when poachers' collective activity integrates them within a subcultural community.4 Jenkins's version of "textual poaching" comes closer to describing the act of creating new media from old at which scrapbook makers industriously plied their scissors. Yet the metaphor that scrapbook makers themselves more often used for their work was not poaching but gleaning: gathering the small bits, the leftovers, the dropped grapes or the grain left in the corners of the field--the surplus and excess--and making a meal of them. (One scrapbook seen for this study even has a print of Jean Francois Millet's painting "The Gleaners" on its cover.) Like the poacher, the gleaner does not own the land, did not produce the crop or livestock, but steps in when it is ready, takes what is available, and puts it to her or his own uses. Gleaning shifts from the implied masculinity of shooting game, engaged in a kind of warfare with the landowner, to a model of gathering that is not passive or compliant, and is decidedly open to feminine participation. Poaching has important reciprocal elements: The gleaners' bounty depends on the planter's willingness not to squeeze every possible bit of profit from the land; following the biblical injunction to leave food for the gleaners, the planter does not pursue every last scrap of grain or produce but leaves some unclaimed.5 The gleaner can still create multiple meanings and readings from the text, and can even bake bread from gleaned grain and sell it under the gleaner's label. As literary critics have long noted, authors inevitably leave a surplus of meaning, sometimes obvious as ambiguity, which readers maneuver within, or scoop up, glean, and reuse. And just as authors cannot nail meaning to a fixed spot, neither can they or their publishers control the circulation and ordering or reordering of meaning. Even when copyright locks down the right to reproduce texts, readers have the option of moving those old texts to new contexts, creating a new tier of private circulation: clipping texts out of newspapers, pasting them into scrapbooks, or today onto Web pages, and circulating this new compiled version. Nineteenth-century scrapbook makers were part of an elaborate circuit of recirculation, one that trespassed or found easements across the enclosure of authorship and publication.

Coping with Old Media Many nineteenth-century American readers found books expensive or hard to obtain, while newspapers and magazines proliferated at an overwhelming rate. "We have so many old newspapers that we cannot afford house-room for them all; and if we could, they would never get re-read. Old papers rarely do," Julia Colman complained in 1873.6 They constituted a new subcategory of media--the cheap, the disposable, and yet somehow tantalizingly valuable, if only their value could be separated from their ephemerality. Readers adapted to this proliferation of print by cutting it up and saving it, reorganizing it, and sometimes recirculating it. Approaches for coping with the rising tide of print included library vertical files and cataloging systems like Melvil Dewey's, and commercial clipping bureaus that scanned a city's or nation's papers on behalf of clients. But at home, other readers, like a family Colman visited, created scrapbooks to capture this value. The clipping scrapbooks I discuss here were generally a separate category from memorabilia scrapbooks and related works like theatrical scrapbooks that we associate with documenting personal lives. But each clipping scrapbook maker too created a private and idiosyncratic catalog, a reflection of personal identity made from mass-produced and distributed publication as much like Netscape Bookmarks or Microsoft Favorites as a library's vertical files. These Web management devices help users blaze a trail through a vast landscape of materials. A variety of technologies has long existed to assist readers in managing the confusing abundance of texts. Three-dimensional bookmarks allow the reader to find the same place again in a codex, making it easier to compare passages in different parts of the same book, or in different books. Medieval bookmarks that consisted of a bead or other anchor with a bundle of ribbons or threads running out from it, marking many pages in the same book at once, eased the comparing of passages. Accessing several passages at a time was further facilitated by the Renaissance bookwheel, a specialized apparatus holding many open books. The seated reader turned it to move between desired passages, holding them all open for reference, presumably while distilling them into a new form, writing something else from them. The bookwheel assumed a limited number of books would be wanted at one time; the three-dimensional bookmark assumes that the reader will recall what book the desired passage was in. Another system, John Todd's Index Rerum of 1835, encouraged readers to create a personal catalog of their own reading. Todd proposed a system for tying one's

210

Ellen Gruber Garvey

reading to an alphabetized catalog, so that invisible threads run out from the index to bookshelves. The scheme was offered in the form of a blank book with pages headed alphabetically, with each letter subdivided by vowels (it begins Aa, Ae, Ai, etc.); the user entered a word on the page matching the first letter and first vowel following, noting an item pertaining to "alphabet," for example, on the page Aa. The Index Rerum assumed continued access to the books one referenced, in stable form: the same old editions, so that the page numbering would hold true; a unified, organically growing self, so that the lines that struck the reader at age twenty would be the passage still needed at age forty. It assumed that items would be categorized well enough to be found again; and of course that the reader would be organized enough to keep the Index Rerum at hand, and be diligent enough to take the notes in the first place. The commonplace book, in which passages from other works are copied out by hand, in use for centuries, serves some of the functions of both the bookwheel and Index Rerum, but instead of marking a place in the cornfield, it scoops up the grain and turns it into a new form, bakes bread with it, makes a new book of it. A trail of crumbs or references may mark the way back, but more likely leaves the reader of the commonplace book with something new: a collection of passages that lead nowhere, but have become freestanding "quotes" and sayings. The reader becomes an author. In her memoirs, Kate Sanborn, a late nineteenth-century author, lecturer, and anthologist, cites a verse on the subject she learned as a child:
In reading authors, when you find Bright passages that strike your mind, And which, perhaps you may have reason To think on in another season; Be not contented with the sight, But jot them down in black and white; Such respect is wisely shown As makes another's thought your own.7

She memorized the poem--another way of making another's thought one's own. And while memorizing it and copying it, Sanborn dropped the author's name, very effectively making it her own. Depending on how well the reader notes the sources, the trail of crumbs left behind may leave the reader stranded without a way back, like Hansel and Gretel after dropping their bread crumbs in the woods.

As John Todd noted in presenting his Index Rerum, commonplace book keeping required more effort than most readers would put into it; it was not well adapted to coping with the increased quantities of materials passing before readers' eyes. Even following Todd's paradoxical injunction to users of his volume to "Read nothing which is not worth remembering and which you may not wish hereafter to review" wouldn't tame the wilderness to be tracked.8 The Index Rerum is tied to an ideal world of permanence: books that stay on a predictable shelf, or at least maintain the same form and pagination. The books' permanence invites respect: The reader should not mark them or cut out useful portions, but preserve their integrity, and hope that the threads of the Index Rerum leading to them would be strong. By the final quarter of the nineteenth century, the distance between the ideal books Todd instructs readers to index and the real reading material they encountered widened. Some readers were likely to read many more books than they would be likely to own, leaving them with the reference to a book they could no longer find, or a page reference that did not match an edition they now had access to--an expired link, in other words. More significantly, magazines and newspapers proliferated, and these were not as likely to remain on a shelf or offer continued access. An 1892 Harper's Monthly column saw the shift as symptomatic of a more general problem of the accelerating pace of life: "The magazine, in a generation that must run as it reads, takes the place of the book," the columnist complained. "Must we all go to making scrap-books in order to preserve the good things that fly on the leaves of the winged press?"9 The virtual and three-dimensional bookmark, the Index Rerum, the commonplace book, and the scrapbook all have in common the desire to mark the path of one's own reading, to not pass through the field without leaving a trace, but to find one's way back to a desired spot. That path might be a public one, in the form of the links on a widely advertised Web page, or a published Index Rerum or selection of favorite sayings; it might be privately kept as a scrapbook on a hidden shelf, a commonplace book in code, or on a password-protected home computer; or it might be somewhere between these extremes: a scrapbook on the parlor table, borrowed by friends; or a personal Web page unlikely to show up on a search because few or no other sites are linked to it. The scrapbook had some advantages over the Index Rerum, but it possessed a different set of flaws. It emphasized its own inadequacy; it could not encompass all reading that interested a reader; it could not hold even every poem one might wish to read again, and if it did, it would be too big to be useful, returning the reader to the original problem of

212

surplus. Even focused or classified scrapbooks are miscellaneous; they may have started out to hold or categorize one kind of material, but materials ultimately slip out of category, demonstrating their instability. In reusing both the form of the book and the clippings pasted in, scrapbooks resemble websites, which mingle the link-compiling function of the bookmark with content borrowed without attribution from other websites. The same recycled source codes underlie thousands of websites, just as scrapbooks silently borrowed their formal qualities from one another and from the volumes that structured them. Although it is easy to see the advantages of capacious, expandable, fluid hypertext over three-dimensional scrapbooks constrained by paper and glue, scrapbooks have at least one significant advantage: Links in scrapbooks do not expire. Scrapbooks thus both embody a system of categorizing material, however haphazard and full of exceptions, and leave a permanent record of that categorizing. Because they literally--materially--categorize, scrapbooks can reveal something of how readers read and thought of the works they saved; because they mirrored and brought into the home the practices of recirculation that were common in the press, they can reveal something of nineteenth-century American attitudes about the boundaries between reading and authoring and about the ways in which all media, old or new, are experienced as renewable resources. Exchanges While readers clipped papers and made scrapbooks at home, in the professional realm of publishing, editors engaged in the related practice of exchanging. Nineteenth-century publications routinely picked up and reused material from other publications without payment and sometimes without credit. Exchange might suggest a simple one-for-one passing back and forth of papers, but as we might guess from some of its other uses, such as the telephone exchange and the stock exchange, the term also comprises circuits of connection and diffusion. The value of exchanges as a method for spreading news and information around the country was recognized by the post office, which allowed newspapers to send their exchange papers free. Some editors were said to send out from "ten to sixteen hundred exchange papers to other editors across the country," and more internationally.10 The exchanges among publications allowed newspapers in one locality to pick up and run news from another and helped to create a local press that covered the nation without specific correspondents in each locality. Journalists and commentators often remarked

Scissorizing and Scrapbooks

213

on this recirculation of material, not as a failure to generate original material, but as a virtue--a mechanism unifying the country. As one journalist asserted, "A man who reads the daily exchanges of the country may see an idea travel from the Atlantic slope to the Pacific and from the Pacific to the Atlantic as visibly as a train of freight cars runs over the Vanderbilt system."11 Going through other papers for exchanges was a routine part of a periodical staff's work. Editorial shears were considered as indispensable as the editor's pencil or printer's composing stick. Large papers had a special "exchange editor" with this duty. On smaller publications it was part of the general editor's work. So, for example, as a typical small town editor, Bartley Hubbard, of William Dean Howells's A Modern Instance, makes up the week's paper by going through other newspapers with his editorial scissors. The exchange mechanism's potential for proliferation was attractive. One missionary writer suggested hopefully that if even one column "of interesting religious matter could be introduced into each of [the nation's many] papers, it would be equivalent to the annual distribution of more than sixteen hundred million tract pages."12 But casting a column upon the waters was no guarantee of seeing it reprinted a thousandfold. The exchange process was a selective one, because editors engaged in a gatekeeping or winnowing process. In the case of signed columns, exchanges were therefore understood as a spontaneous, decentralized index to the popularity of a writers' work. So in Fanny Fern's Ruth Hall the indication that Ruth is achieving acclaim as a writer is in the number of her pieces that are "scissorized" and copied into exchanges: "A good sign for you Mrs. Hall; a good test of your popularity," her publisher tells her. And her brother, the spoiler, editor of another periodical, instructs his staff not to copy his sister's work, so as not to give her further publicity.13 In Lillie Devereux Blake's 1874 novel Fettered for Life, similarly, Frank Haywood, reporter for the Trumpeter, is succeeding when his reports on his travels in the South "meet with the highest praise from all quarters, and are copied all over the country."14 This free access allowed to editorial gleaners could enhance the publisher's as well the author's stature. In editor Jeannette Gilder's novel Taken by Siege (1886), a young journalist's "local stories began to be largely copied by the State papers, and The Freelance got a reputation that it had never had before."15 Many publications carried a column headed "from our exchanges" marking the material as coming from outside the community. Exchange columns spread ideas and perhaps created a sense of identity among such groups as readers of high school newspapers, fraternity members, and suffragists, all of whose newspapers carried reports from kindred newspapers via exchanges.

Clipping and Making Scrapbooks While editors were plying the editorial shears in the office, a parallel activity was under way in the home. (I have elsewhere discussed the gendered element to these activities.16) Readers treasured and saved up stories and articles in scrapbooks, creating permanent repositories that reflected their tastes and uses for works. Saving and reusing scraps was an ideal of housekeeping. Just as cloth scraps were to be saved and recycled as new clothes or as quilts, scraps of usable printed matter were saved and remade in another form. The two forms were occasionally compared. Like quilters, scrapbook makers generated a new form along the way, creating the usefulness of the scraps by saving and classifying, and thus making them available for reuse. The scrapbook was often understood as a liminal form between book and newspaper, and making scrapbooks was described in nineteenthcentury books and articles on the subject as taking place on the border between reading and authoring. Like newspaper exchanges, the contents of scrapbooks were understood as an index to the popular heart: Critics complained that deserving American poets had never received book publication and therefore had "no habitation but the corner of a newspaper, or the scrapbook of a friend."17 Admiration for a poem was expressed by saying that it would be clipped for many scrapbooks, while writer-characters within several stories and poems find having their work in someone's scrapbook the highest tribute. The scrapbook asserted nondominant, if not subversive, readings. In fact the acclaim of the scrapbook was sometimes set against the judgment of more prestigious authorities: "If the scrapbooks of the land could to-day be drawn forth from their receptacles, we should find that Alice Cary has a place as a poet in the hearts of the people, which no mere critic in his grandeur has ever allowed," says one writer in a typical version of this move.18 But unlike Henry Jenkins's Star Trek enthusiasts, all those Alice Cary collectors were not likely to gather or in other ways form a community over their scrapbook making. Like exchanges, scrapbooks endorse an ideal not of originality, but of reuse and recirculation, of making the old continually new. In fact, they rotated in the same circuit with exchanges. E. W. Gurley, writing on scrapbook making, advises, "As a general thing, original articles are not the best. Those items, stories, and poems which have gone the rounds of the press until they have had the corners knocked off, have proved their worth by their circulation; it is `the survival of the fittest.'"19 A similar Darwinian emphasis appears in another nineteenth-century scheme for classifying and making excerpts useful, John Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, first issued in Boston in 1855, which valued the long-lived

Scissorizing and Scrapbooks

215

familiar quotation over the surprising or little-known one. Gurley goes on to find further virtues in widely circulated work: "The best papers to select from are those with `patent insides'"--that is, papers with syndicated ready-printed material sent out to papers across the country. "Extracts from such papers are usually well printed, and the extracts from them look well in the scrap-book." One could participate in literary culture, in other words, by joining in this work of recirculation, or even by making attractive books. In the most extreme version of this activity, re-creating the form of a book might override the possibility of reading it. Margaret Lynn and her siblings, all bookish children, were sometimes particularly attentive to this aspect of scrapbook making: "the nice management which brought everything out even at the bottom of the page." Her brother Henry, who didn't like poetry, was eager to have it for his scrapbook, to make attractively even columns: "Mary, with her customary readiness of device, filled in her inch or half-inch spaces with miscellaneous obituary notices. It didn't matter if she didn't know the people, she said; they were dead just the same." John trimmed a poem "to fit a vacant space, impartially clipping off the last words on the outstanding ends of the longer lines."20 Making Books Makers of clipping scrapbooks used a variety of forms for their collections. Some used the elaborately bound books sold as scrapbooks and more often used for trade cards and calling cards. Some booklike systems sold commercially were intended for quasiprofessional use by speakers. Mark Twain marketed his patent preglued scrapbook, suggesting it would forestall the utterances of profanity that resulted from not finding the gluepot when wanted. Margaret Lynn found that the gift of a Twain scrapbook obligated her to "choose carefully and economically the matter that was to be perpetuated in its orderly pages." It "almost put the making of scrapbooks on a new plane, and forbade the use of inferior material."21 The fact that it cost something hindered her former freewheeling scrapbook-making ways. Nonprofessional readers were much drawn to the form of the book, which conferred dignity and authority on the clippings. Blank books bestowed permanence on clippings and housed fugitive pieces. And many scrapbook makers reused old books. Lynn and her siblings used Agricultural and Horticultural Reports, a box of which were delivered to their home each year. Their tedious contents made them more empty than blank books, and making them into scrapbooks redeemed them from limbo.

From our point of view the books were quite unreadable and almost pitifully useless. A book that couldn't be read was an abject thing. . . . It didn't seem possible that so many books should be published with absolutely nothing in them.22 Julia Colman's 1873 article on scrapbook making advocated this practice. The narrator, visiting the scrapbook-making family we met earlier, finds the mother and children busy:
Each child had a brush, a pair of scissors, some waste paper, and a book. In the latter [Hubert] was neatly pasting the slips which he received from the mother."

The narrator is shocked.
"Why,' said I. `You are using up good printed books!" "Good for what!" was the Yankee reply, more easily made than gainsaid. "There is nothing in them that we want, and so we propose putting in something, rather than have them stand idle. Hubert's, you see, is an old day-book, and we have one or two others. Some of them are old school-books, not much worn, but out of date. Almost every library has some useless books."23

The mother explains that buying blank scrapbooks would be too expensive, since each child has at least two scrapbooks to accommodate his or her various interests. The editor of the California magazine Overland Monthly describes in 1896 finding the scrapbook he kept as a young man and wrote, "It is an old `Agricultural Report,' and emits a damp, aged

odor."23 He assumes his readers will understand this compression, without stopping to explain that he made his scrapbook by pasting clippings into an old book. Reused books commonly included used ledger books and day books, which might obviously have a limited utility once they'd been used, but also novels like volume I of Thaddeus of Warsaw, or a religious text like The Saint's Everlasting Rest by Oliver Cromwell's chaplain Richard Baxter, and even Bibles. Reusing books to make scrapbooks goes beyond Yankee thrift. A clipping in the Baxter scrapbook, which seems at first perverse in the context of a book that has pieces of paper glued over its leaves, and other leaves cut out to make room for the clippings, points to one meaning of the choice of an old book for a scrapbook. The unattributed domestic advice piece, "[ ]s for Using Books" (the first word is illegible), is a list of rules for the physical care of books: "Never hold a book near a fire. Never drop a book upon the floor. . . . Never turn down corners of leaves. . . . Never write upon a paper laid upon the leaves of an open book, as the pencil or pen point will either scratch or cut the book leaves."25 The clipping hints that despite having in one sense destroyed a book, the maker valued books--prized them as a symbol of qualities worth preserving and saw the binding and the rest of the physical book as valuable. The value she gave her ephemeral clippings by pasting them in it placed the clippings with books worthy of protection. Even her slicing out of leaves in between pages with clippings has the effect of preserving the binding by not overfilling the book. So this scrapbook maker's claim to authorship through making a scrapbook was further buttressed by making her scrapbook as booklike as possible.

Scrapbooks were a domestic form, like the "profiles" on a personal computer, storing the user's choices for what should be on the desktop, for example, yet the circuit of recirculation within which they were engaged was neither wholly domestic nor wholly public. The line between the scrapbook of the home and the published periodical was further blurred by the use of the word scrapbook in the titles of several magazines: In the midnineteenth century, Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap-Book and The American Scrap Book; in the early twentieth century, Frank Munsey's The Scrap Book, and The Official Bulletin and Scrap Book of the League of American Wheelmen, among others. Other publications, like Littell's Living Age, announced themselves as digests and consisted largely or entirely of articles recirculated from other publications.

Scissorizing and Scrapbooks

219

Scrapbooks might be shared with an intimate or large circle, and were a form of private publication, like the amateur press publications or "zines" of their day. They might be kept within a family as part of its library. The occasional claim that the value of the scrapbook is transferable, and that it could be useful to others, is not universal. John Todd suggested that a published Index Rerum would be useful only to members of the same profession. But scrapbooks were often characterized as too personal and revealing to even be shown to others. The maker of the scrapbook carved an individual creation suited to individual interests out of massdistributed material. Scrapbooks and Classification Articles on how to make scrapbooks, or describing the benefits of scrapbooks, repeat variations on the theme of the family--especially the farm family--sitting together in

220

Ellen Gruber Garvey

the evening making scrapbooks on their own favorite topics. In one such family, visited by Julia Colman, young Hubert, "is enamored of voyages and travels, and his big book has become almost a gazetteer. He arranges the articles alphabetically, and we often refer to them for information that we cannot find in books." The other children in this family have their scrapbooks on housekeeping, cookery, and poetry. There's Susie's "Guide to Health," and Charlie's "Horticultural Guide"; Hartley takes the mechanical and scientific items while "Libbie enjoys the pictures, and the baby glories in the wastepaper."26 The classification of the clippings becomes inextricable from the classification of the children and creates value from the clippings. The scrapbooks become the common property of the family, consulted by all when in need of poetry or information about foreign lands. Gurley praises a similar arrangement:
Would it not be a pleasant picture of a farmer's family gathered around the fireside of a winter's evening overhauling a bundle of papers selected for this purpose? Each one may have his or her own book. The father may have the general topic of the "The Farm," the mother, The Home. One of the boys likes horses and cattle, and he is on the lookout for everything in that line; one of his sisters is poetical, another romantic, and "poetry" and "stories" will fall to them, and so on through all the topics. When the selections are made, let them be read aloud and discussed as to their merits and proper classification, and much good will will be gained by it. Where a custom like this is observed in a family, that home will be pleasanter, and that family will take an advanced standing in society.27

Scrapbook making is imagined as an occasion for domestic sociability, a way of uniting the interests of the farm and farmhouse through the medium of the pastepot. These accounts' emphasis on the farm home is a reminder that access to published material was not equally distributed. The ideal Gurley and Colman hold out is that by sifting through the detritus of the cheap press, the marginalized rural family can classify marginalized material and thereby create value from it. As they gather to pull apart mainstream culture and remake it for their own uses, they create their own cultural nexus, a knot of threads leading into and out of the family. They can make it even more meaningful and valuable by putting it in the form of a book, and even figuratively move it from the margin to the center of the page within the covers of an existing book. Old newspapers are clutter, but thematically organized volumes are useful. But why did farm families have material that had to be remade in this way? Americans received quantities of cheap print because publishers--first newspaper publishers and then farm and family paper publishers--had discovered that subscribers could be ex-

changed for money via advertising and that high circulation, or at least the ability to claim it, brought advertising. Like the nineteenth-century patent medicine pitchmen who proposed wildly catholic and inclusive lists of ailments a single product purported to cure, hoping a more varied list of illnesses would appeal to more customers, many publishers aimed for high circulations by including something for everyone in the family. Such inclusiveness also made it more plausible for advertisers of varied wares to advertise in the publications. So cheap magazines and farm papers deliberately addressed multiple audiences, with columns on crops, animal husbandry, housekeeping, and religious matters; recipes, poems and stories; and amusements for children. In practice, many scrapbooks are not so clearly systematized as Hubert's, Susie's, and their siblings', but contain a mix. Poetry, household hints, and columns of miscellaneous information in the same book are common. Makers of such scrapbooks appear to have chosen on the basis of taste, saving what they thought would be worth rereading. To the extent these books reflect categorization within the papers, they sharpen the categories by eliminating specific ones: collecting poetry, household hints, and varied anecdotes, but not crop information, for example. Scrapbook making gathered in and dispersed in a continual diastolic­systolic movement, and circulated labor and leisure as well: for adults, making them was both work and a leisure activity. Making them also occupied children who might otherwise require the adult labor of supervision. Scrapbooks were often suggested as an ideal gift for an invalid child or adult alone in the sickbed and in need of amusement.28 The scrapbook absorbed material and labor, processing and transforming them. Scrapbooks and Authorship Although scrapbooks were understood as local productions, they sometimes had wider readership than the family. Some scrapbook makers, especially those who made classified sets with separate volumes on different topics, reported either lending them out, with particularly heavy calls for some volumes, or finding them so valuable that they allowed visitors to read them only on the premises. Scrapbooks were occasionally privately printed and circulated among friends, like a scrapbook "gathering songs and verses for over fifty years" that Harper's Monthly's "Editor's Easy Chair" extols for its ability to summon the memories and tastes of an era,29 or An Old Scrap-book with Additions, "printed but not published, for Distribution as a passing Token to Personal Friends" by John Murray Forbes, a railroad magnate.30 Such anthologies moved out into the marketplace. The editor of a collection of poems and inspirational sayings explains, "For many years gems of

222

Ellen Gruber Garvey

poetry and prose have found their way into a scrap-book, until friends, who felt a delicacy in borrowing so well-worn a volume, have urged me to give it publication."31 After Elbert Hubbard died in the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, his Roycroft associates published his scrapbook, although his "storing up in his Scrap Book the fruits of other men's genius" had been only "gathering spiritual provisions for his own refreshment and delectation" and not intended for publication.32 The genre continued into the twentieth century, including The Dale Carnegie Scrapbook, which intersperses Carnegie's own inspirational remarks with others he collected. And scrapbooks are frequently referred to as the source for anthologies intended for use by speakers and ministers, with such titles as The Public Speaker's Scrapbook. As in Bartlett, the original text may well drop out of view altogether, as an industry develops of collecting and recirculating pithy, pious, or inspiring sayings. Ministers and other speakers pick lines from such compendia and pass them around and collect them themselves, creating and supporting a genre of "quotes." I have discussed ways in which web bookmarks or favorite web pages echo earlier scrapbook forms and uses, in creating coherence from broadly miscellaneous materials and materials without attribution, even if the coherence or associations are clear only to the creator. The web has also given new life and form to published commonplace books and scrapbooks. Dozens of sites collect and solicit "favorite quotes" or display the site owner's own collection. A few are specialized and serve as a focus for community ("A Commonplace Book for Advisors: A Treasury of Quotations for Academic Advisors and Other Mentors in Higher Education"); most are broad, uncategorized but searchable by keyword.33 Like the scrapbooks and commonplace books self-published by wealthy men, web sites are usually created outside the constraints and citation conventions enforced by publishers and editors. On the web, source and author become further detached from the freefloating quotes. While authors' names might still be present, perhaps because they serve as warrant of the value of the passage, titles of works from which they came are more often omitted, or the source may be given as Bartlett's or another compilation. Written passages that were once part of a larger work enter into a half life as quotes appended as signature files to email as well, where their position suggests that they represent the uniqueness of the email writer's thoughts, rather than their original author's.34 As the fragmented selections recirculate further into new contexts, they may be pressed into incongruous service. George W. Bush exemplified this trend when he quoted a few sentences from George Eliot's Adam Bede in a 2001 speech at the National Summit on Fatherhood, to reinforce his praise of narrowly defined marriage as "incredibly important for children." He read:

Scissorizing and Scrapbooks

223

What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined for life to strengthen each other in all labor, to rest on each other in all sorrow, to be one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories at the moment of last parting.35

While George Eliot's views on marriage were complex, her own twenty-four-year union with a married man who lived apart from his children and Adam Bede's plot involving an abandoned pregnant woman who commits infanticide would suggest that someone who had encountered the lines in the context of the novel might not choose them to make this point. Bush or his speechwriters might have been lulled by the presence of the passage on over seventy-five websites for planning weddings, for documenting weddings, and for marriage counseling, several of which include the lines in wedding ceremonies. They may not have taken it from the "Marriage Builders" site, which misspells Eliot, adds the Hallmark phrase "to share with each other in all gladness," and omits the troubling "at the moment of last parting." (Marriage Builders lays down a firm line against unmarried cohabitation.) They probably did not take it from the personal "Spirit of Shaarilla" website which moves Marriage Builders' work a step further by adding the gladness line, lopping off the last parting, and attributing it to "Anonymous." The Osmond Network's "Valentine Community" makes the same changes and attributes the passage to Ranier Maria Rilke.36 On the other hand, Bush's omission of a phrase in the original ("to minister to each other in all pain") hints at some other unlocated source. The violence done to the passage sounds more like armed poaching than the more pacific-seeming gleaning, but de Certeau assumed his poaching readers actually read the work they'd mentally adapted to their own conceptions. This loose trade in detached quotations, gleaning from what other gleaners drop and then passing along the genetically modified products, may have accelerated with the web, but the practice has earlier roots. Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century scrapbook makers were invited to recirculate their work into others' anthologies as well. Papers even solicited, paid for, and reprinted the "priceless gems" readers had collected, in one case in a volume subtitled "The Old Scrapbook," which was thus "written" by 52,000 readers who sent in clippings as well by the authors of inspirational verse and anecdotes they clipped, initially for use in the National Magazine, and then in this anthology. The scrapbook was again linked to the heart as an alternative literary authority in this formula: "Those things that appeal to you must appeal to others; that note of inspiration laid aside--bring it forth and let us make a magazine that will speak the language of the heart as well as of the mind."37 The second volume, subtitled "The Old Homestead," still makes the scrapbook an explicit source. Its contents come from "dear old grandfather or grandmother in serene old age, who with

224

Ellen Gruber Garvey

tremulous hands cut from their treasured scrap-books the selection that is to them a real `heart throb' fraught with tender memories."38 One could participate in authorship without writing a line, in other words. Writing is understood as a process of recirculation, in which information is sorted and stockpiled until it can acquire value by being inserted into a new context. As often appears to be true on web pages, the origin of the material is less important than the new form it takes, resorted and made available in new ways. A model in which the person who gathers the information is considered the author has late twentieth-century analogs, for example the daily newspaper reporter who calls in a disconnected story to someone who turns it into "writing" ("Gimme rewrite, sweetheart"), while the reporter gets the byline. But it is striking that fiction writing, too, is sometimes the product of a good scrapbook. In a 1915 article in the Writer, "a monthly magazine of interest to all literary workers," Delsher Welch gives scrapbook keeping a ringing endorsement by invoking the example of Louisa May Alcott. Welch recalls her telling him, "The habit of reading with a pair of scissors in my hand has stood me in good stead for much of my literary work."39 Alcott herself published a series of books with the overall title Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag, metaphorizing stories as reused cloth, also material to be dealt with with scissors in hand. If even Louisa May Alcott was simply in the business of recirculating scrapbook clippings, or at least writers and potential scrapbook makers were invited to see her that way, then making scrapbooks could seem not so different from publishing a book. Locating and classifying the scraps made them as useful as other books. Putting them into the form of a book further asserted this authority. Scrapbooks have a way of reifying the metaphors we use to think about reading. Perhaps it is the solidity of paper and glue that does it, more substantial than the metaphoric cut-and-paste functions of word processing programs. Bricolage and construction of meaning have become bywords for understanding how readers interact with texts, so much so that the concrete referent of these metaphors is nearly lost. But for nineteenth-century compilers of scrapbooks made up of clippings from newspapers and magazines, those terms are not metaphoric but straightforwardly descriptive. The scrapbook maker constructs meaning by acting as a good bricoleur: collecting odds and ends and pasting down these assorted preexisting artifacts to create a new work, gleaning the matter of her own sustenance, improvising a new structure with them. Scrapbook makers literally made new media out of old. These new media in some cases preserved and displayed the works the compiler most valued; in others they sorted overwhelming qualities of printed matter into usable selections, while they marked their

Scissorizing and Scrapbooks

225

makers' sense of affinity with the public world of books and their desire to participate in it. Making and keeping scrapbooks allowed participation in some of the functions of the author and publisher without lifting a pen, as compilers adapted writers' words to fit new and personal meanings. Like present-day web site builders, they adopted a fetishized selection of trappings of publication that appeared to grant authority as well. Through their new medium, scrapbook makers straddled the personal and the mass-circulated. Notes

The Book Dematerializes

Alfred Kazin began work in 1938 on his first book, On Native Grounds. Thf child of poor and diffident Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, he stndied at City College. While uninspired professors processed large classes and Stalinistil and Trotskyites tnrned the cafeteria into a battleground, Kazin-;omehow de· · veloped a passion for literature and began to write reviews. He had money or backing, yet he managed to put together an extraordinary, com· prehensive book, to tell the sto~y of the !,reat American intellectual andliter· ·. ary movements from the late nineteenth centnry to his own time and to set · them in a richly evoked historical co.;t~. One institution made his work .· possible: the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street, where he spent almost five years. As Kazin later recalled:

Anything I had heard of and wanted to see, the blessed place owned: first editions of American novels out of those germinal decades after the Civil War that led to my theme of the "modern"; old catalogues from long-departed Chicago publishers who had been young men in the 1890s trying to support a little realism; yellowing, crumbling, but intact sets of the old Masses (1911-1918), which was to the Stalinist New Masses what St. Francis is to the Inquisition. The library's holdings taught him "what hope, elan, intellectual freshness C:une with those pioneer realists out of the Middle West who said there was no runerjcan literature but the one they were rushing to create." Without leaving Manhattan, Kazin read his way into "lonely small towns, prairie villages, isolated colleges, dustf law offices, national magazines and provincial 'acadc· mies' where no one suspected that the obedient-lookingyoung reporters, law

clerks, librarians, teachers would turn out to be Willa Cather, Robert Frost, Sinclair Lewis, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore." 1 Kazin and his close friend Richard Hofstadter, with whom he shared quick lunches at the Automat, fast games of ping-pong, and an occasional afternoon of newsreels, were only two of the countless writers, readers, and critics who over the centuries have found themselves and their subjects in libraries. It is an old story, quiet and reassuring: bookish boy or girl enters the cool, dark library and discovers loneliness and freedom. For the last ten years or so, however, the cities of the book have been anything but quiet. The computer and the Internet have transformed reading more dramatically than anything since the printing press. In great libraries from Stanford to Oxford, pages turn, scanners hum, databases grow-and the world ofbooks, of copyrighted information and repositories of individual copies, trembles. Scenarios for the apocalypse have often involved books: Revelation mentions letters, describes a book with seven seals; and uses the closing of a book as a vivid metaphorfor the end of the physical world: "And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together" (6:14). But at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the rhetorical situation l;tas reversed itself. Great information projects, mounted by Google and rival companies, have elicited millenarian prophecies about texts as we know them: claims that the printed :· book, magazine, and newspaper are as dead as the trees their paper comes from, and predictions that digital repositories of human knowledge will not only replace but will also improve on them. In 2006, Kevin Kelly, the self. styled "chief Maverick" of Wired, published one of the more influential of l;hese in the New York Times. In a thoughtful review of the intricate legal issues associated with digitizing books in copYfight, Kelly vividly describes the virtuallibrary that Google and its rivals and partnors are creating. In the near future, Kelly believes, "all the books in the· world" will "become a single liquid fabric of interconnected words· and ideas." The user of the electronic library will be able to bring together "all texts-past and present, multilingual-on .a particular subject," and by doing so ''a clearer sense of what we as a civilization, a species, do know and don't know. The white spaces of our collective ignorance are highlighted, while the golden peaks of our knowledge are drawn with completeness;"' Others have evoked even more millennia! prospects: a universal archive that will contain not only all books and artiCles but also .all documents everywhere; the basis for a total history of the human race.

Librarians, publishers, professors, printers-all of us are fascinated by the prospect that such prophets conjure up: a future in which readers in search of information always turn to screens rather than books, and, as e-books improve, even readers in search of pleasure begin to do the same. This prospect infuriates some acolytes of the book: for example, Jean-Noel Jeanneney, historian and former director of the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, who in 2005 published a sad little volume in which he denounced Google Books as a typical American plot, at once imperialist and boorish, rather like the war in Iraq. Google, he argued, win first fill the Web with books in English and then profit by distorting the world of learning and literature. Only energetic countermeasures--preferably sponsored by national governments rather than corporations--can save European literature and scholarship.' Instinct and experience predispose me to find some substance in critiques of the new textual world. I am a lover of old libraries-the libraries of the 1960s and I 970s, in which I became i. scholar. As a student in those years, I lived in what felt like a bibliomaniac's paradise and in retrospect still seems to have been an idyll. Books and journals were cheap, and library budgets were healthy. Even in the United States, the stacks-of good libraries from Connecticut to California were loaded With sixteenth- and seventeenth-century tomes that no one had yet declared rife, as well as reprmts of anything the library did not possess in its original form. I prowled,the vast open-stack collections at the University of Chicago, where I studied, and Cornell and Princeton, where I taught, pulling books off the shelves by dozens, as fascinated by what they could tell me about nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars and students as by what they revealed about the more distant past I studied. As a New Yorker, like Kazin, I also loved to sit in the shabby but dignified reading rooms of the New York Public Library, waiting for the indicator to show that my books had arrived. In those days, many libraries did not have coffee shops, and those that had one were Jnore likely to provide vending rna. chines than fresh espresso and cappuccino. Nonetheless, they became a chosen hangout, for me and for others like me. Late in the 1970s, when I learned that the Princeton library had identified me as a "heavy user,'' I was not surprised, though the choice of terminology worried me a little. The love of lib~es hru; taken me to strange and wonderful places: to the British Library in London,_ still housed in the 1970s under the pale blue nineteenth-century dome that sheltered Karl Marx, Coli;, Wilson; and other outsiders; to the Warburg Insti-

lute, also in London, whose founder and successors arranged their books by what they called the "good neighbor principle," so that readers who looked for a particular book in the stacks would be surprised and edified by the others next to it; to the Bodleian Library, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden, and the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana. One of the many things I have learned from years misspent amid the smells of dust and noble rot is that every library embodies a perspective of its own. Their contents, the way in which manuscripts and books are catalogued and arranged on shelves, and their gaps-all tell stories to those who can listen, about writers, readers, and collectors, and the historical worlds they inhabited. Scholars become great when they attend to what these purpose-built collections, with their distinctive systems '\fld oral traditions, have to teach. No one has described the austerely local nature of humanistic scholarship more precisely than the historian Peter Brown, who traces his own formation to the time he spent in the Lower Reading Room of the Bodleian Library: It was a world of books, each deeply rooted in the landscape of a single library. They were available in one place only, for rapt readers, who, themselves, had taken on something of the quality of natural features. They were visible year after year at their desks. Over'the years, from 1953 to 1978, I passed from status to status. In these years, my mind changed <_>ften. But in the Lower Reading Room of Bodley nothing seemed to change. Opposite me, for instance, th~re always sat a known authority on the relation between Augustine's Scriptural readings and the liturgy of Hippo. He was not a member of the university. He was a clergyman who came up regularly from his vicarage in the countryside of Oxfordshire. I observed that he wore bedroom slippers. Frequently, the slippers appe')fedto win out over the books, and he wonld fill asleep. A prim young man at il:hat time, I wondered if I could really trust the views of so somnolent a· person on the Donatist schism. But the reverend gentleman stood for a wider world oflearning, open to more professions and capa-· hie of nourishing many more forms of scholarly endeavor than that which I now expect to find, among my colleagues, in a seminar, room. It was for persons such as hirn-,-"-for personsoflearrting and of general culture, who were not necessarily academics-as well as for my students and c_olleagues at Oxford, that I wrote. my Augustine of Hippo, and went

292

out of my way to ensure that it would be published iu England by Faber's of London and not by a University Press. Figures such as these communicated the uncanny stillness of a shared life oflearniug.4 To have known reading in this artisanal form is to distrust any plan that treats books as interchangeable and aims-as Google does-at universality. But it would be absurd to joiu Jeanneney's crusade. Enter a word or phrase in any European language iu the Google Books search field and you learn immediately that the system already contains thousands of texts in languages other than English. As to the French goveinment, its last great gift to the world of books was the library that Jeanneney directed, a buildiug that looks like the set from some forgotten dystopian sci-fi film of the 1970s-thiuk Logan~ Run-and is about as much fun to work iu. As a liberal, iu the current AngloAmerican sense, I believe that competent governments do many thiugs better than markets can, but I am not at all sure that France's statist way of providing books for readers is a case in po_iut. The Bibliothl:que Nationale deserves credit for its own database, Gallica, which offers a canon ·<{"'3Jfefully selected texts, well digitized, and for its provision of up!to-aate foreign books. But it has yet to show that it can, or wants to, mobilize ;md make accessible to the world a vast, disorderly mass of texts, canonical and nontanonical, for readers to use freely. Many American and British librarians are exuberant about the prospect of briuging the books iu their custody to new publics, through new ll)edia, and anyone can see why. After all, one thiug that Google Books makes clearer every day is that you can study many aspects of French thought and literature as deeply iu New York as in Paris, and a lot more efficiently.

The·Universal Library Theproblem is how to understand what is happeniug right now, as-we all try to·remaiustanding agaiust the tidal waves of traditional books and new media that are breakiug over us.

will not have access to in the next ten or twenty years. We have dearly reached something of a watershed, a new era in the history of text production and consumption. On many fronts, traditional periodicals and books are making way for blogs, computer databases, and other electronic formats. But magazines and books still sell a lot of copies. The current drive to digitize the written record is one of a number of aitical projects in the long saga of our drive to accumulate, store, and.retrieve information efficiently. It will result not in the infotopia that the prophets conjure up, but in one more in a series of new information ecologies, all of them challenging, in which readers, writers, and producers of text have learned to survive and flourish. For centuries--for millennia-the scribes and sd10lars who produced books often were also the ones who organized them in collections and devised ways ofhelping readers find and master what they needed. As early as the third millennium BCE, Mesopotamian scribes began to catalogue the tablets in their collections. For ease of reference, they appended content descriptions to the edges of tablets, and they adopted systematic shelving for quick identification of related telCts. The greatest of ancient collections, the Li~ of Alexandria, had, in its ambition and its methods, a good de.al ~-common ~th Go ogle's efforts. It was founded around 300 BCE by Ptolemy I, who had inherited Alexandria, a brand-new city, from Alexander the Great. A historian with a taste for poetry, Ptolemy decided to amass a comprehensive collection of Greek literature, philosophy, and science. Like Google, the library developed an efficient pro~edure for capturing and reproducing texts. When ships docked in Alexandria, any scrolls found on them were confiscated and taken to the library. The staff made copies for the owners and stored the originals in heaps until they could be catalogued-a fact that gives some idea of the scale of the operation. Copies of Homer obtained this way were designafed "those fr~m ships." At the'collection's height, it contained more than half a million scrolls, a welter of ip.formation that forced librarians to develop new organizational methods. For the first time, texts were shelved alphabetically. Faced with this daunting mass, the poet and scholar Callinmchus drew up comprehensive bibliographies. Enterprising forgers had run up so many fake' texts to satisfy . the library's appetite that he had to distinguish systematically between the . genuine works of the· great poets and the spurious ones that the library also · possessed. Gradually, the library became a center of focused sd1olarship, where a. series oflibrarians__.:.Zenqdotus of Ephesus, Aristophanes ofByzan·

texts. Many details of their work, only partially preserved after the destruction of the library, remain controversial. Yet it seems clear that they not only devised new philological methods but also standardized the text of Homer that circulated in Egypt during the Hellenistic and Roman periods-a major achievement in an age when every text was copied by hand. 5 Six hundred years after Callimachus, Eusebius, a historian and bishop of the seacoast city of Caesarea in Palestine, assembled and corrected Christian sources in the local library. There he also devised a complex network of
cross-references, known as ""canon tables," which enabled readers to find

parallel passages in the four Gospels-a system that the distinguished modem scholar James O'Donnell recently described as the world's first set of hot links. A deft impresario, Eusebius mobilized a team of secretaries and scribes to produce Bibles featuring his new tables. The emperor Constantine acknowledged that Eusebius had developed a uniquely efficient system. In the 330s, he placed an order with the bishop for fifty parchment codex Bibles for the chnrches of his new city, 'Constantinople.J::onstantine himself supplied the necessary skins (in the age of manuscript('blo'od sacrifice was the price of beautiful books), and sent them to Ells$ius by the imperial rapid delivery service. He knew. that only the scriptorium in Caesarea conld tum the raw materials into accurate, properly formatted _bibles in the short time he allowed.6 Throughout the Middle Ages, the great monastic libraries continued ·to engage in the twin enterprises of accumulating and cataloguing large holdings and, in their scriptoria,.makillg and disseminating copies of key texts. The rise of printing in fifteenth-century Europe transformed the regimes oflibrarians and readers. Into a world alniady literate and curious, the printers brought, within half a century, some28,000 titles and millions of individual books-many times more than Ellropean libraries had previously held. Reports of new worlds,· new theologies, and new ideas about the universe traveled faster and sold for lower prices than ever before, Even in this period of aggressive expansion, the traditional skills oflearned librarians continued to find employment in the enn:epreneurial world of printing. Giovanni Andrea Bussi, librarian of the papal collection of Sixtus IV, also served as .advisor to two German printers in Rome, Conrad'Sweyoheym and Arnold Pannartz. They printed the classics and the church fathers in handsome editions· that were siguificantly cheaper than manuscripts. Lo-

cal scholars, thrilled by the speed and economy of the new process, made the tranquil gardens of the Vatican resound with their praises. Bussi edited and corrected their copy and sometimes added eloquent prefaces to their books. Like many first movers, however, Bussi and his partners soon learned that they had overestimated the market, which could not absorb editions that ran from a few hundred toJUore than a thousand copies. They found themselves-as Bussi eloquently complained to pope Sixtus IV-in a Roman palace full of the drying sheets they had printed but empty offood. 7 They were not the last entrepreneurs of new information technologies to experience this kind of difficulty. Still, the model Bussi helped to establish-one in which erudite scholars advised hardheaded printers--remained standard in the sixteenth century, and some of the printers who rejected it did so only because they themselves were learned men, who conld choose and correct their own copy. Over the next three centuries, the profit-driven industry of publishing and the industrious scholarship of theilibraries became separate spheres. Yet in the last few years, as sales of urtiversity press books have dwindled and journal subscription prices have gone.through thp-FGjlf. this ancient model has been resurgent. Through their electrortic publlshing programs, libraries have begun to take on many of the tasks that traditionally fell to urtiversitypresseS, such as distribution of PhD dissertations and reproduction oflocal book and document collections. Ithaka, a nonprofit consrutancy that issued a report on scholarly publishing in Jwy 2007, noted the excitement that these new possibilities had · generated among librarians.' Irofti.cally, neither the consnltants nor the many commentators on their work realized that in regairting partial control over the ways that tex!soare processed and made available, great libraries were not breaking new ground but going back t,o the future. The new electrortic library that not ocly sto~es texts but also publishes them on its Web page, is engaging in a spread of activities that Eusebius}vonld have found perfectly natural. Fast, .reliable methods of seatch and .retrieval are sometimes identified as the hallmilik of our information age: "Search is eve,rything" has become a proverb. Bpt scholars have grappled for millennia with too much information, and in periods when information resources seemed to be growing es, pecially fast, they devised ingenious ways to control-lmd use the floods. The Renaissance, du;ing which numbers of available texts grew at an,imprecedented pace, was-th~ ~;~reat age of systematic note 'takirig. Manuals taught students how to condense the contents of all of literature, ancient and

\

modern, in abstracts and extracts organized by headings. Jeremias Drexel, a seventeenth-century Jesuit who wrote one of the standard treatments, showed how much this art was valued by the title he chose for it, "Goldmine." His frontispiece was even more eloquent-it juxtaposed a group of miners digging for gold in the ground with a single scholar taking notes on the truer gold in his books.' Scholars well grounded in this regime, like Isaac Casaubon, spun tough, efficient webs of notes around the margins of their books and in their notebooks-hundreds of Casaubon's annotated books and almost sixty of his copybooks survive-and used them to retrieve information about everything from the religion of Greek tragedy to the history of Egyptian culture in late antiquity. 10 Then, as now, attractive and costly new technologies took shape. Jacques Cujas, a prominent sixteenth-century legal scholar, amazed visitors to his study when he showed them the rotating barber's chair and moveable book stand that enabled him to keep ~any open books in view at the same time, moving himself or the text as the occasion required. Thomas Harrison, a seventeenth-century English, inventor who seems to have sprung from the pages of a novel by J. G. Farrell, e;;;ii>ed an information eabinet that he called the "Ark of Studies." A squad or readers, he explained, could summarize and excerpt the vast number ofbooks being published, and arrange their notes by subject on labeled metal hooks, somewhat in the manner of a twentiethcentury card index. The great German philosopher Leibniz-perhaps the last , man who was simultaneously at the cutting edges of history, philosophy, and natural science--enthusiastically obtained one of Harrison's cabinets and used it in his research.U For less erudite so'uls, simpler techniques abridged the process of looking for information, much as Wikipedia and Google do now. Erasmus said-and believed-that every serious student must read the entire corpus of the classics and make his own notes on them. But he also composed a magoificent reference work, the Adages, i1) whlch he laid out and -explicated thousands of pithy ancient sayings-and provided neat subject indexes to help readers find what they needed. For centuries, thousands of schoolboys first encoun. . tered the wisdom of the ancients in this handy, predigested form: When Erasmus told the story of Pandora, he said that she did not open ajar-as in the original version ofthe story by the Greek poet Hesiod-but instead box. In every European language except Italian, as Erwin and DoraPanofsky showed

long ago, "Pandora's box" became proverbial, as playwrights, poets, and essayists rriade Erasmus's collection their first port of call for a neat way to express the dangers of thoughtless action, not to mention their fear of women. 12 Like Al Gore's invention of the Internet, Pandora's box is a canard-one made ubiquitons, almost universal, by the power of a new information technology. Even the best search procedures, in other words, depend on the databases they explore, and sometimes yield factoids, rather than facts. From the eighteenth century onward, a new pattern gradually established itself. States, universities, and academies maintained great research libraries, more or less available to the public. At their most ambitious, they offered readers books. and manuscripts in encyclopedic abundance. In\perial libraries collected information on a worldwide scale, vividly symbolized by the enormous domes that covered their central reading rooms. Their staffs also pioneered in information retrieval. They nofonly organized the books on the shelves but also devised mnltiple indexes to help readers find the information they needed-including such longtime stat:i~ as the printed catalogues of the British Library and the Library ofCongress. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries also witnessed a vast democratization of general reading-a story be~utifnlly told in part by Jonathan Rose.l' Cheap collections like Everyman's Library and the Haldeman-Jnlius Little Blue Books brought solid .books other than the· Bible and the Book of Martyrs into working-class households. Public libraries offered little islands of 11,eace and print among the sprawling, clpotic tenement blocks of the industrial cities. The old regimes of note talcing became less important, as the dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, and collections of quotations that had been developing since the eighteenth century became more and more a part of everyday bourgeois life. The title used ~or one popnlar form of reference work in Germany and Russia, "Conv~ation Lexicon," gives.a sense of what books like this could do for readers who, like so many Chekhov characters, wanted,to converse all_ day on every subject under the sun. Yet no collection, no work of reference could offer all the books or information relevant to a complex subject, In the 1940s, Fremont Rider, a practitioner of Extreme Librarianship at Wesleyan, prophesied .that titl~s were multiplying so quickly that they would soon overflow even the biggest sep; of stacks. He and his iofluential acolyteVerner Clapp argued that microphotography could elim" inate this problem. Just photograph the books, store the images on cards, and

298

toss the dusty, decaying originals. The card catalogue in its drawers would become the actual research library, which could survive and grow forever. Readers would be able to find anything they wanted, in a dean, accessibk form, while librarians could stop building and maintaining expensive open stacks. 14 Projects multiplied. Some of them-like Eugene Power's Short Title Catalogue project, which distributed 26,000 early English books on microfilm-genuinely changed tbe working lives of scholars and students. Meanwhile, otber companies offered texts on microfiche, or simply reprinted books tbat had become rare or fragile on modem, acid-free paper. From the 1950s on, libraries began to resound witb the deep voices of salesmen who claimed tbat tbey could provide vast runs of material immune to decay. The results were genuinely dramatic. As old universities expanded and new ones sprouted in tbe 1950s and 1960s, generous funding enabled tbem to buy what was available on film or microfiche and in reprint form and tbus to cre· ate effective collections in ten or fifteen years--sometimes from a standing start. Many ambitious lil{~s devised and carried out tbeir own schemes as well. Suddenly, you coul<! conduct serious research on tbe Vatican Library's collections not only in Rome but also in St. Louis, where tbe Knights of Columbus assembled a vast corpns of thicrofilms; or study tbe Milanese Bib· lioteca Ambrosiana at Notre Dame. For tbe first time, you could become an expert bibliographer or paleographer, edittexts or excerpt ancient newspapers and journals, without ever leaving home in California or Kansas. (Scholars, of course, did tbeir best to conce'!l tbese facts from tbe deans who funded their research travel.) But tbe film- and reprint-based libraries of tbe 1950s and 1960s never became really comprehensive. The commercial companies tbat did tbe filming naturally concentrated on marketable materials. Nonprofit sponsors concentrated on tbe texts that mattered to:tb6m---Catb~lic institutions, for example, on medieval Latin manuscripts. No· dear logic determined which texts were reprinted on paper, which were .filmed, and which remained in obscurity. It all cost a great deal more tban anyone had envisioned at first.

light-had tragic consequences. Thousands of original documents of great beauty and interest were physically destroyed while their contents were recorded on film. Library users who had once been able to savor the artistry of Wrnsor McCay's "Little Nemo in Slumberland" in the colorful pages of the New York Herald found themselves squinting at black-and-white images on blurry screens. In this new, Darwinian ecology, the photographic revolution dwindled-physically, in most libraries--from a sweeping project to change the way everyone read and worked to a single room where graduate students, fuculty, and unusually diligent undergraduates pored over texts that they were willing to read even in an unappealing, black-and-white form. Rider's promise of a world of information on neatly filed cards yielded thousands of reels of film that must be cranked and maneuvered to be read. It is a lesson to remember as we move through a new age-of rapid change and great promises."

Google's Empire The current era of digitalization unquestionably outstrips that of microfilm, in ambition and in achievement. Few individuals ev~r owned microfilm or microfiche readers, after all, whereas most serious readers in developed countries now have direct access to personal computers or laptops and an Internet connection. The changes wrought by all this are obviotis. Even the most traditionally minded of scholars, faced with· the need to look up a date, a fuct, or a text, gen~rally begins not by going to a library reference room crammed with encyclopedias and handbooks, but by consulting a s~arch engine. "Conservatively," a cheerful editor from Cambridge University Press told me, "95 percent of all scholarly inquiries start at Google." And that'makes ;ense: Google, the nerdiest of corporations, has roots in the world of bpoks. Ascoiding to oral tradition, Google's founders started out with a plan to create an electronic database of the books at Stanford and turned to ~.Web only because it "offered, .at that time, a smaller sample size. Google's fumoussearch algorithm, moreover, emulates the principle of schol.atly citation. By counting up ancfevalu.ating earlier linlcs, Google steers users. to the sources that oihers have already found helpful. In a sense, the hypermodern search engine reselflbles nothing more tlian a teeming mass of old-fashioned footnotes. just as footnotes tell you where an author went to dig up his or her facts and quotations, so Google tells you where most people have gone before you in order to learn what you want to know.

CODEX IN CRISIS

For the last few years, Google and its competitors have heen at work on staggeringly ambitious projects, designed to transform the way in which all readers go about finding books. Even the scale of this enterprise is hard to fathom. A conservative estimate of the number of books published throughout history is 32 million: currently, though, Google believes that that there could be as many as 100 million. The company collaborates with publishersthere are currently some 10,000 of these so-called Google partners around the world-to provide information about books currently in print, including text samples, to all users of the Web. So do a number of rival companies. As Google, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble compete, the Web has become a vast and vivid online bookstore. Anyone with a laptop can scan dust jackets, read blurbs, and peek between the covers of the limited group ofbooks that can still be bought. Cambridge University Press, which became a partner in 2004, receives 500"000 page views a inonth from searchers who began at Google or Googi.(£o~ks. In other words, around two-thirds of all the potential customers for the books of the world's oldest publisher start at Go ogle rather than the press's own Web site. A second, even larger enterprise-the Google Library Project-has brought the company into collaboration with great libraries around the world. Drawing on the vast collections. of Stanford, Harvard, Michigan, the New York Public Library, and many others, Google is digitizing as many out-of-print books as possible. It is an extraordinary effort that Google itself describes as designed to "build a comprehensive index of all the books in the world." This index, moreover, will enable readers to sear.ch all the books it contains and to see full texts of all those n9t covered, by copyright. Google's book project is a twenty-firstcentury version ofFremont.R{der's pl.in, on steroids and in your face: a list of books that will ultimately be universal in scope, accessible everywhere, and accompanied by full texts. It is hard to exaggerate how much mate.rial is becoming accessible month by month and what will become ~!'cessible in the next few years, for those wh.; study the distant past or the Third World as well as those primarily concerned.with the presen.t. ·Google is flanked by other big efforts. Some are largely philanthropic, like·the old standby Projeet Gutenberg, which provides hand-keyboarded texts of English andAmencan classics, plain in appearance and easy to use, and the distinctive Million~ Book Project, founded by Raj Reddy at Carnegie Mellon University.

world to provide, among other things, online texts in many languagM for which character-recognition software is not yet available. Add in the hundreds of smaller efforts in specialized fields. Perseus, for ex· ample, an incredibly useful site based at Tufts, began with Greek and Latin texts and now embraces works from the English Renaissance. Readers can make direct online use of dictionaries, grammars, and commentaries as they struggle through the originals. There are also new commercial enterprises like Alexander Street, which offers libraries beautifully produced electronic collections of everything from "Harper's Weekly" to the letters and diaries of American immigrants. Even the biggest libraries are expanding faster and more vertiginously than Borges conld have dreamt, thanks to the electronic resources listed, at length, on their Web pages. It has already become impossible for ordin'9".J!..-~cholars to keep abreast of the basic sources onlinethough D-Lib Magazine, an online publication, helps by highlighting library Web pages that do an especially good job of organizing digital sources and collections, rather as material libraries used to advertise their acquisition of a writer's papers or a collection of hooks with fine bindings. Many librarians view these developme~ts with warm approval. Kristian Jensen is a ,dapper, hyperarticnlate curator of early printed books at the British Library, who worke_d with Microsoft. on a project, now abandoned, to digitize the library's immense holdings in nineteenth-century literature. His tlsual style is extremely .precise and sober,. but when he talks about the prospects of digital libraries, he lights up. "You can't help being enthusiastic," he says, at the thought of all this ";natenal becoming available to teachers and students at universiti~s and,·s.chools all over the world. One way to see what he means is to visit the Web site of the Online Computer Library Center and look at their WorldMap. This imaginative application plots numbers of books in public and academic systems around the world, country by country. Ask tlie WorldMap to show you. how many public library books the world's nations boast: you will· /;ee the. relati~n of the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, and of Western natiqns to their former colonies, all laid out in stark color. Sixty million Bdto;ms have 1!6 million public library books at their disposal, w:hile the more tlfan l.l billion Indians have 36 million." . World poverty, in other words, is embodied in lack of print as well as lack of food-it means that citizens of many natio~s do not have access. to their own literatore and .history, much less to information about other countries.

The Internet, as constituted in its short past, has not yet done much to r~, dress this imbalance. In 2005, when I sat in a tin-roofed, incandescently hut West African Internet cafe and tried to answer questions from my students In America, I could find little high-end material on the screen, and neither, by the look of things, could my Beninese fellow users. By now it would be possi· ble to find far more, and better, digital resources, even on a slow PC in Naititingou. As the capillary spread of electrification reaches smaller and smaller cities, as Internet cafes sprout in small Asian, Mrican, and Latin American towns, and as Goog!e and its rivals fill the Web with solid texts, the .. 11\ap of knowledge will undergo a metamorphosis. Capitalism, of all things, is \) democratizing access to books at an unprecedented pace. · Kazin loved the New York Public Library because it admitted everyone. His fellow readers included not only neat young scholars like Hofstadter, but also wild figures from Weegee's photographs of the New York night: "the little man with one slice of hair across his bald head, like General MacArthur's ... poring with a faint smile over a large six-column Bible in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, En· glish, French, German," and "the bony, uply, screeching ntadwoman who reminded me of Maxim Gorky's 'Boless,' the anguished old maid who had a professional scribe take down passionate letters to a lover and then asked the , scribe to make up letters from the lover to her." 17 Even Kazin's democratic imagination could ngt have envisaged the Web's new world of informatign and its hordes of actual and pote1>tial users.

But it could feed an unlimited nUIIlber ofhungry minds with~Pame~ Gandhi, Voltaire, and Wollstonecraftas well as the classics of ~ther cuiiuies, and the manuals of sciences and trades, in dozens of languages. The consequences may be seismic,. bigger and louder and deeper than we can hope to predict. Some. powerful figures in the realm of books, as we have seen, fear that thes~ projects will simply reinforce the world hegemony of English.

Ovenden, who works with Google at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, points out that the millions of books that will be digitized there are in some forty languages. Meanwhile, libraries on the Continent and elsewhere are signing Google partnership agreements of their own. The mass of old and new texts on the Web will not be an English-only zone. The Internet's technologies, moreover, are continually developing, and many of the changes make it easier for a user to take a stand in the flood of information and fish out exactly the right book or article from the foam. Consider the search function: the hunting-gathering-connecting of information that Go6gle ot Yahoo or Ask does on our behalf. In its first age, a search engine used,,a--~crawler"-actually a stationery entity-to look for relevant pages on a stored, and slighdy out-of-date, version of the Web. No two search engines gave exactly the same results, though Google regularly found more and more !-'sefulsites than its rivals, and this accomplishment won it placement as the sole engine of choice on many official Web pages. Even Google's crawler, though, remained as fixated on surfaces as a fashion photographer. It informed the user ouly about the Spercent or so of content prominendy labeled as ~uch on,the top layers of Web pages. To find materials buried in such deep bodies of fact and do7mnentas the Library of Congress's Web site or JSTOR (the vast repository of scholarly journal articles), you had to carry out gynamic, focused searches: by going to the site and asking a specific question, or hiring a specialist firm like Bright Planet to ask it thousands of times foryou. ~ In recent years, however, as-anyone who regularly uses Go ogle knows, the crawlers have become more-adept at asking questions, and the search companies haveapparendy induced the big proprietary sites to become more responsive to the crawlers' inquiries. Specialist engines like Google Scholar can discriminate with astonishing precision- between relevant and irrelevant, firsthand and <;Ierivative information.- Internet tools offer not just more information every day but also more effective ways of formulating precise iflquiries. One of my favorites is Amazon's list of "statistically improbable phrases," or SIPs, in.any given book.- Click on one of them and Amazon whisks you offto a list of other books in which the same highly unusual combination of words appears--a fast and_ simple y.tY to find connections that previous buyers have not already made. Your local reference librarian still knows a lot more tricks than you do for finding information, in books or on

the Web. But the powers of search keep growing, and it is hard to imagine what they will be in ten or twenty years. For all its virtues, the Google Library Project, in its present, working form, has received mixed reviews, and that is understandable. Google shows the reader a scanned version of the page. These are generally accurate and readable-though individual pages can be blurry or obscured, and scanner operators occasionally miss pages or scan them out of order. Sometimes the copy used is imperfect. In the spirit of the movie Office Space, at least one scholarly acquaintance has spotted a body part, scanned with the text. Other problems are more serious. Google uses optical character recognition to prodJice a second version, for use by its search engine, and this process has some quirkS. In a scriptorium lit by the sun, a scribe could mistakeuly transcribe a "u" as an "n," or vice versa. Curiously, the computer makes the same mistakes. If you enter "qualitas"-an important term in medieval philosophyin Google Book Search, you will find ahuost 2,000 appearances. But if you enter "qnalitas," a nonword, you will be rewarded with more than 600 references to ''qualitas" that you would not have found using the correct term. That is a lot of "qnalitas." If you want to get a sense of the full magnitude of the problem, call up the Google version ofa German book printed in the old spiky Jrpe, Fraktur, and ask to "view plain text"-the text used for search. In many cases, the system will show you page after page of gobbledygook. It seems sigfor both science and scholarship, "WISnificant that the Germarr word ·. .senschaft," often appears as' "Wrlferischaft" in these random text zones. It is hard to see how errors on this scale will ever be eliminated-any more than the thousands of errors made when the catalogues of the great university and public libraries were converted into databases will ever be corrected as a whole. Serious pro\>lems also affect the "metadata," or data about data, that · Google offers its users. The cataloguing information that identifies any given hem is often incomplete or confusing. Multivolmne works can be very hard to use, since Go ogle originally treated them as single items (this policy seems to have changed, perhaps in response to users' complaints: the hive mind at work). And the key terms that Google provides in order to characterize indi- . vidual books are sometimes unintentionally comic. It is not all that helpful, when you are thinking about how to use an old Baedeker guide to Paris, to be told randomly that one of its central concepts is "fauteuil." The possibilities for glitches, and the pretexts for grmnbling, are endless. Scholars, whose ·

interests are minutely precise and philological, inclined by disposition and experience to look on the dark side, often concentrate on these blemishes. HI It is true that, thanks to Google and its rivals, social and cultural historians work on the period from the mid-eighteenth to the early twentieth century already occupy a massive and growing intellectual sweet spot. Without ever leaving home, they can search for evidence about everything from political language to the rise of new technologies, in a database much larger than any historian has ever used before. Where details about editions matter less than sheer quantity of easijy accessible, generally reliable informationor where only a single, ninete~nth-century edition exists-digitization has already brought about a revolut(on. It is an amazing experience to teach liter, ary texts that you know well, but not pe~fectly, with the Google Books text up and searchable on your laptop. And it is more than transformative to sit in · your office at a small liberal arts or community college and call up, as you already can, thousands of books in dozens of languages, the nearest material copy of which is hundreds of miles away. Still, even the sweet spot has its sour patches. Though Google claims to make full texts available for all books not protected by copyright, in fact you "' cannot download or even read in full many of the out-of-copyright texts. The system allows you to see only the same three wavy li~ banners of text (pretty mum guaranteed na't t,<> CO,lltain the exact passage Y?U need) that it offers for books in copyright. Li\<e Erasmus,. Go ogle is bot'ri" generous and a fallible guide to the universe of books·', / An analogy may help to highlight Google's accomplishments and limitations. In the 1910s and 1920s1 Aichibald.CaryCo6lidge supervised the con' struction and organization .of Harvard University's Widener Library, the world's greatest collection of sqolarly books. Like the creators of Google, he worked on a grand scale, deliberately building collections not only of rare and famous works but ;$o o('Writfugs which are neither great nor fashionable," since these were essential for "background and filling in." Like them, too, he emphasized the need to make books as accessible as possible, both by creating a library large .enough to hold millions of them and by cataloguing them as rapidly as possible. Bnt Coolidge, as William Bentinck- · Smith recorded, "led a life of books. He was seldom without them. In his younger days he traveled aqoss Asia with a little trunkload of them," and in later years he read as he walked in the country." Accordingly, when Coolidge
~

306

CODEX IN CRISIS

set out to create a universal library, he did not simply start buying books by the ton. Instead, he searched the world for integral collections that would add new fields to Widener's holdings, systematically building resources for both present and future research. His directing intelligence, and those of the helpers and donors he inspired, played a vital role in making the Widener a uniquely efficient machine for scholarly work; its catalogues were as accurate as its holdings were comprehensive. The Google Library project aims to be genuinely universal, as no material library can, even the Widener. But it lacks the governing vision of a Coolidge, and accordingly operates less as a vast, coherent ordqing mechanism than as a gigantic fire hose dousing the world's readers with texts untouched by human hands or minds. Google could do much more for the world's readers if it invited Coolidge's modern counterparts-masters of both the virtual world of information and the sensuous, material world of real books--to plan and shape its virtual library. At present, th~ugh, no evidence suggests that Google sees the future of its enterprise in these terms. . In the end, moreover, general conditions set limits to what the Google project, along with its competitors, can acli.ieve, at least in the near term. The miCrofilm years showed that reproduction projects on a large scale are realized when undertaken by national inStl1::fitions determined to preserve a patrimony and malre it availal;>le; or by coJhpanies out to malre money. So far, the new Web companies have·moved'm~ faster, and uiJ.like the Bibliotheque Nationale, they have plumped fi>r making vast quantities of books available for other~ to sort and use, rather than for digitizing preselected, well known texts; But even Google's sleei.<, high-powered engines cannot pull books onto the Web any faster than the pots of money that fuel them will allow. In the end, Google will digitjze only as much as the relevant income stream allows-a point imderlined by Microsoft's recent decision to leave this field to Google. Th~t means that they are going to leave vast numbers of important books untouched. At every turn, technical and economiC problems confront Google and its rivals and limit their freedom of action. One of the most frequently discussed difficulties i.sthat of copyright. Google estimates, very roughly, that'between 5 and 10 percent of known books are currently in print. Twenty percent more-those produced between the beginning of print in the fifteenth century and 1923-are otit of copyright The remainder-perhaps 75 percent of

all books ever printed-are "orphans," still covered by the very long copyright protections currently in force in Europe and North America, but out of print and pretty much out of mind. Rather as the Alexandrian library confiscated scrolls fr6m ships, Google simply scans as many of these as it can, though it lacks legal permission to do so. But this part of the firm's project remains highly controversial. A number of the publishers who use Google to market their new books have sued to prevent Google from scanning books in copyright without o]>taining formal permission-a daunting prospect. For the moment, accordingly, Google is not making these works fully available, and a recent legal settlement only makes it possible to show larger portions of such books to Google users. Then, too, Google has no im,mediate plans to scan books from the first couple of centuries of printing. When asked why, computer people sometimes explain that the books' fragile condition makes them hard to scan. That is ridiculous: most early books are far less fragile, thanks to the fine rag paper on which they were printed and the glorious craft skills-of their makers, than the nineteenth-cen~ novels-'mass<produc<;d on wood pulp paper and now dried out and brittle-that Goilgie's scanners are capturing by the hundreds. The real reason is commercial ..Rare boo~eq!lire expensive special conditions for copying, and most of those likely to glmerate a lot of use have /, already been made available by companies like Chad\vyck-Healey and Gale. These descendants of the microtilm houses sell massive collections to libraries and universities, for substantial ·fees. Early English Books Online (EEBO) offers 100,000 titles printed between 1475 and 1700, 25,000 of them searchable. Ei~teenth Century'Collections Online provides searchable full texts of around 150,000 books-33 million pages' worth. Massive tomes in Latin and the little pamphle;ts that poured <)ff the presses during the Puritan revolution, schoolbooks, Jaoobean tragedies with prompters' notes, and political pamphlets by wild-eyed Diggers are all available in their original form to any main library user in New York or London, Syracuse or Sydney. Google will not directly explore this territory. Other vast and viial sectors of·the world;s book production are neither catalogued nor accessible on site, much less available for digitization.

with cash flow. One possible outcome of the current race to digitize, then, is a new version of the existing imbalances between north and south, former metropoles and former colonies. The book-deprived inhabitants of subSaharan Africa aud much of India may be able to read Western works of every kind on screen. It is far less certain that they will be able to find and read texts in their own languages. Whatever happens on screen, the great libraries of the Northern Hemisphere will remain irreplaceable for a long time. One of the best things com' puterization will do for everyone is simply to pinpoint the location of the books people need. Astonishingly, for all the hundreds of millions of books in American college ·and university libraries, there are normally no more than five copies of any given book in a language other than English. Google has always described itself as a company that shows users the way to find the information they need, not as the primary provider of that information. In the carefully chosen words of Jim Gerber, director of Content Partnerships, "We · want to make sure readers can find books." The company does this job very well-and we would be·foolish to expect its managers to take on further tasks for no extra compensation. · A record of all history"appears \"'en more distant.

The point to keep in mind'is that if you plan to make the whole record of human experience avagable, as the ;,ost utopian champions of digitization imagine, you have to render both kinds of collection accessible online.

at everything from digitizing the papers of major thinkers like Hannah Arendt to collecting sound and video materials systematically and making them available as well. Its Web site is already a magnificent archive open to the world. Meanwhile, individual curiosity and passion have driven the creation of virtual archives on every imaginable subject, often unconnected with any material collection. The Web can transport you to documents on sages from Thomas and Jane Welch Carlyle to Edward Said, to vast runs of reproduced political poems and cartoons, and even into the recondite field that I cultivate: the Latin writing of the Renaissance (try the Web sites "White Trash . Scriptorium" and "Philological Museum"; both are indispensable). 20 . But even the biggest of these projects is nothing more than a flare of light . in the vast and -.still unexplore\1 night sky of humanity's documented past. The Archive of the Indies in Simancas, a magnificent product of the Spanish · monarchy's obsession with record keeping, possesses an estimated 86 million pages' worth of documents. With the help of IBM, it has now .digitized more than 10 million of these. Scholars and students who go to Simancas can do much of their work on screen, saving the originals and their eyesight at one and the same time. But they cannot search or aocess these pages from abroad. ArchivesUSA, a Web-based kuide to Americ'an archives, lists S,SOO·repositories and more than'160,000 collections of primary source material. The Na-' . tional Archives alone contain sonfe'fl.ine billion ·items. It is not likely that we will see the whole archives of tho/ United States online in the immediate _) rV" futnre-much less those of poo;<:r nations. The supposed nniversallibnrry,then, and its companion universal archive, will not be a seamless mass ofbooks, easily linked and studied together, but a patchwork ot different interfaces and databases, some open to anyone with a computer arid WiFi, others closed to those who lack access or money. The real challenge.now is how to chart the tectonic plates of infm;mation that are crashing irito .one another and then to learn to navigate the new landscapes they are creating. Blaise Agnera y Areas, until recently an architect at Microsoft Live Labs and a pioneer in computer-assisted bibliography (full disclosure: he took courses with me years _ago at Princeton), suggests that the best way to think about the masses of material that are being gathered on the Web is to divide them in two. One of them is a library and cultural archive of the present. Go ogle and its competitors have already gathered collections far more massive than anything

.

the world has known-collections of the books published and the music, art, and film produced after 1990 or so. Though these companies would all disclaim any ambition to serve as the world's repositories, that is what they have pecome. Each of them holds a sea of data, of books that have been captured and made searchable, of images and tunes-all of it washing around
in multiple, redundant servers, constantly moving, continually refreshed. Over time, as more of this material emerges from protection and becomes

accessible-and it will-we will be able to learn things about our culture, in the present, which we could never have known in the past. We will still be able to read books and scrutinize images as we always have, but we will also be able to interrogate this whole mass of material in new ways, using the same applied mathematical techniques that the National Security Agency uses to mine data from our telephone calls and e-mails. Soon the present will become overwhelmingly accessible. It is a thrilling prospect, but it has some scary implications. Readers and lovers of music and the arts already attend more to the present than the past. And the second great wodge of material-the great messy assemblage of sources for earlier periods, some complete but many partial, some open to all and others for profit, that is now taking shape-will not, in the foreseeable future, coalesce into a single, accessible database. Nj'ither Google nor anyone else will fuse the proprietary collectipns of early books and the local systems created by in~ dividtlal archives into a .single accessible mass of information. Though the distant past will also be more accessible than ever before, in a technical sense, once it is capfured artll.preserved as a vast, disjointed mosaic, it may actually recede ever more rapidly from our collective attention. We will still need our material libraries and archives. In some ways, we have come to understand better than ever before in the last twenty years or so just what makes old-fashioned, bricks-and mortar collections essential and distinctive. Historians, literary scholars, and librarians have realized, in the words ofJohn Seely Brown and Paul Duguid, that information leads a "social · . life" of its OWn. The form in which you eneounter a text can have a huge im" pact on how you use it. Take the simplest case: If you want to make people pelieve that a given official document-say, a letter from the commanding officer of a young Texan in the Air National Guard-is genuiri.e, you cannot just give people its wording.You have to show that it is on the right sort of pap~r, entered in the standard form, and type<! on the proper Selectric. The

only way to know that for certain is to see the original and compare it to others, and in most cases, you can do that only in an archive where they are reliably stored. As scanning technology improves, watermarks and other vital signs are becoming more accessible to remote users. But scholarly or even forensic exactitude still requires direct consultation of original documents. Original documents and books reward us for taking the trouble to find them by telling us things no im3.ge can. Duguid describes watching a fellow historian systematically sniff 250-year-old letters in an archive. By detecting the smell of vinegar-which had been sprinkled on letters from towns struck by cholera in the eighteenth century, in the hope of disinfecting them-he could trace the history of disease outbreaks. 21 Historians of the book, a new and growing tribe, /ead books as scouts read trails. Bindings-custom made, for the most part, in the early centuries of printing-can tell you who owned them and what level of society they belonged to. Marginal annotationswhich abounded in the centuries when readers habitually went through books pen in hand-identify the often surprising messages that individuals have found as they read. Many original writers and thinkers-Martin Luther, Hester Thrale Piozzi, John Adams, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge-filled their books with notes that are indispensable to understanding their thought. Thousands of forgotten men and women covered Bibles and prayer books, recipe collections'and political pamphlets with pointing hands, underlining, and notes that give deep insight into what their books meant to them-and how they cooked their meals, treated their illnesSes, and said their prayers. 1... ., · ' Ifyou wantto cap~ how a giveli )>ook was packaged and what it has meant to the readers who have~wrapped it, as many scholars now do, you have to ' look notjust at all the editions'h~t also at all the copies you can find, from original manuscripts to cheap reprints. The databases include multiple copies of some titles, l>ut they will never provide all the copies of, say, Adam Smith's _The Wi!alth Nations and the early responses it provoked. Sometimes, too, the processes that hav: turned material books into electronic texts have stripped them of the rich_ evidence that their original form could provtde. The texts available on EEBO; for example, were not scanned from the originals, but from microfilms. Their bindings are not reproduqd, and it is hard to be sure of their original sizes---:.two densely material sets of dues thatscholars constantly use, when working out who read, or was expected to read, a given book.

As companies compete for pole position, market share, and what the neers of the Dot Bomb laughingly called "first mover advantage," they are vising new projects with all the imaginative verve of Fremont Rider. Some these call to mind the effort of the 1960s and 1970s to put everything on crofilm, which did a lot of harm as well as a great deal of good, because ' creators and managers ignored the social life of information. Up to scanning has not caused a second Great Destruction ofn<1-vSI>ap·en:-thcmgh it has resulted in the disposal of a lot of older books and journals. But people who are now banging at library doors seem likely to malce some of the . same mistalces as the microfilm mavens of the 1950s and 1960s. On the other hand, some librarians, like those at Emory University, are beginning to away would-be suitors whose business plans do not properly justify why a collection should surrender its intellectual property to a company-even as , those at other institutions, like the Princeton Theological Seminary, say yes.

I! is not just the conditions of research ihat are changing, but the whole traditional system of writing and publishing-though here, too, the situation is not \ easy to"~ead Books, ma~es, daily n"""spapers, and scholarly journals con\tinue to appear. R. R. Bowker, a company baS<d in New Providence, N""" Jersey, ' ~- ·-~ compiles what was once a book and is now a database, Books in Print. According to Bowker, "publishers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Aus· tralia and New Zealand released 375,000 n""" titles and editions in 2004 ... In, . eluding imported editions available in multiple markets, the total number of new English language books available for sale in the English-speaking world in 2004 was a staggering 450;000."22 Go to any branch of Borders or Barnes & Noble or their British counterparts,_Jllaclcwell's and Waterstone's, and torrents of , brightly jaclceted n""" books on every subject confront you-not to mention · staclcs of penodicals. This tidal wave of n""" print, in fact, poses librarians one of their most serious current problems, In Prince,ton University's Firestone Library, the stacks are already full.

once have been spent on traditional media. Nonetheless, every year the library adds more than a mile of new printed materials to its collection. This mass of print enters the building dynamically, like a battering ram made of paper and buckram. It forces older materials-often rare and valuable-into storage and destroys the traditional order of the collections, which served scholars for generations as a spatially defined memory theater. Like the sorcerer's apprentice, administrators and professors have conjured up so many active young scholars writing theses, articles, and books that they threaten to overwhelm libraries, and the faithful guardians of the knowledge base with them. Journals pose even harder problems. In theory, scholarly and scientific periodicals offer the newest data and hypotheses-the very things that scholars need most urgently. But their subscription prices have risen starkly. Elsevier, said to be the world's-largest for-profit scientific publisher, claims to serve "a global scholarly community of 7,000 journal editors, 70,000 editorial board members, 300,000 reviewers, and 600,000 authors." It charges as much as $21,744 per year for one of its periodicals, Brain Research~more than any but the very richest libraries can possibly afford. And, of course, cataloguing, binding, and finding space for this pullulating mass of new print are formidably expensive. True, new databases offer direct access to thousands of articles. A..sc~olar in the humanities can rummage ~rough older articles in more than .§00 arts, humanities, and social sciences journals without ever leaving his or her aesk, thanks to JS~OR. Project Muse, a second nonprofit collaboration based at Johns Hopkins Unj~rsity Press, offers full-text access to cur' rent and' recent-ru;!i&s fr<;>.m alniost 400 leading journals. Many libraries \. .. have. solved their space problem""'though not their budgetary one""'by abandoning print subscriptions for electronic ones, which enable their faculty.a;id students to identify and read the articles they need more quicldy and easiljr than they could in the era -of print.

with justice, that for-profit journals guard the gates to the kingdom of scientific research paid for by public funds, and earn massive profits by doing so. Many argue that all scholarly and scientific journals--and all university presses-should provide free full-text access to their materials to all. In the case of medical research, Congress has mandated that all80,000 papers produced every year under the sponsorship of the National Institutes of Health be placed on an open federal database, PubMed, once a year has passed from the date of publication. The Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences has gone even further. It has decided that all members of the faculty should post all of their work on an open Harvard Web page. Editors who hope to publish the work of Harvard professors will simply have to accept that a version of the piece in question is already · availab!l'' to the whole world, or allow the professor to post a PDF file of the work as edited and typeset for their journal. I cannot speak for journals or editors in the sciences. But I do serve as one.offour editors of the Journal of the History of Ideas, now in its sixty-ninth year of operation.

CODEX IN CRISIS

Web has created a fantastic new public sphere-and a fantastic new mass of ungainly, misspelled prose. Editors ask writers to take a second and a third look at what they have written-to clarify, polish, and correct. We form a thinlipped gray line, protecting both readers and authors from first thoughts. And this job is more important than ever, now that scholars inhabit an environment that enables them to write on the basis of what the sociologist Andrew Abbott calls "on-time" research-that is to say, snatch-and-grab raids into what is online, carried out in the course of composition-rather than the decks of neadywritten file cards that they would have compiled fifty years ago. 24 Harvard's sweeping solution to the problems faced by libraries and students may have good results in some fields. But in the humanities, satisfying the demand · that every article become immediately accessible on the Web for free will force us to abandon valuable forms and standards. In this new world, journals will become something like blogs with footnotes: unedited texts, glittering with · insights, but also bleutished with errors that no informed eye has picked up, and succeeded by angry, scatological discussion threads. The world of humanistic scholarship needs updating, but it does not need to be transformed ·into one more province of the public sphere that already exists, and serves ( quite different needs, on the Web. ~. 'some of the strongest advocates for digitization seem to welcome this out~pme--or at least the transformation of prose forms that it would bring about. Gregory Crane, the creator of Perseus, evokes a future in which scholars cast all their information not in the traditional forms of nonfictional writing-the article and the book-but 4t smaller, "granular" units that can be combined and rea;inbllied by Web users in an infinite number of ways. Kristian )ensen of the British Library agrees that this may come about. When you.writeJor the Web, he points ,out, you naturallytend·to cast your thoughts in little textual monads rather than in the traditional linear forms. Unlike Crane, though, Jensen is concerned about the result:Thdlow of texts onto the Web, Jensen worries, may be accompanied by--or even help to cause-a revolution in forms of attention that will harm, or even eliutinate, traditional forms of argument and writingc As the railroad threatened the cathedral, the intellectual snack pack threatens slow food. It is not yet clear that online publication will transform writiug as radically as Crane and Jensen suggest. Critics and true believers converge in emphasizing one feature of Web publication above all: its new form. The traditional

book and periodical place a single story, told by a master narrator, in the foreground. Even the most aggressive reader has to accommodate him or herself to the given form of the text. And even the most extensive and aggressive handwritten comments wind themselves around the monumental printed text like ivy growing up a pillar. Web sites, by contrast, place as much emphasis on images as on words and · make lateral movement easier than straightforward progress. Votaries urge the reader to give up the crutches of traditional plot and argument in favor of the self-plotted curves and swoops of this new form of reading. They emphasize that the protean text of the Web, which may change hour by hour as a political crisis unrolls or a hurricane is tracked, fits the conditions of modetn life, with its lack of stable beliefs and even of stable human selves. Similarly, they argue that Web sites-which can be dipped into freely fur one article or image, and which encourage back talk from their readers-fit the dispersed nature of modern life better than stable print media. Others note that this new form of reading is not only dynamic but also interactive. Writers can count the number of hits an article receives on a Web page; readers can use an author's name, laid out in hypertext, to send an e-mail response. Discussion strings make it possible for all involved to carry on elaborate debates about a provocative colu~ or review. At their most intense, these discus$ions metamorphosize into a n~'w kind of reading and writing community--all of whose members exert pr~sure on the choice and treatment of topi~, making the Web site itself in, yractive. Thus, Talking PointsJ-.feniq (TPM), a liberal political site. run by J~sh · Marsliall, employs several rep~t;ters, but also depends on local mformation sent in by readers around the co!rntry. During Hurricane Katrina, readers who worked for the federal governmertt, tracking climate and weather conditions, provided TPM with a level of precision and expertise in reporting that no newspaper or btoadcast news service could match. -'-Critics, by-contrast, heap obloquy on many features of these new textsfr~in the fact that some of them overemphasize design, ,while their words a~~ often transcribed from out-of-copyright sources or. compiled by out-ofwork "content providers," to the ubiquitous presence of bright marginal strips of advertising~.

And they argue that the growth ofmultiple

tiny communities based on the Web will undermine the larger social community in which we all live. Votaries and critics alike exaggerate the novelty of the changes the Web has wrought. The new media of the decades around !900 transformed the presentation of texts just as radically as the Web has. Newspapers appeared regularly in multiple editions, rapidly bringing headline stories up to date. In Berlin, by the end of the nineteenth century, one of the major papers could be printed, packed, and on its way to distribution within eighteen minutes after news reached the central office. The existence of several editions each day meant that the newspaper <:ould follow a breaking story-like the hunt for an escaped murderer--stage by stage. Sometimes, of course, editors themselves promoted, or even created, stories of this kind. The Berliner Zeitung sent a reporter through the city, for example, while urging readers to try to catch him-an efferuve way to galvanize readers' interest and commitment, brilliandy evoked by Graham Greene in Brighton Rock. Kiosks, pillars, and cafes made each new edition available to readers. The city itself spoke, as Peter Fritzsche has shown, spewing an endless stream of stories and sense impressions over its inhabitants.25 Magazines, naturally, were not as protean as newspapers: their content was r fixed in each weeldy or monthly edition. But their massive advertising rev. · enue and longer leag.;time enabled them to experiment with even more varied ways of presenting text and advertisement. Editors self-consciously tried to make them into coherent works of art: not uninterrupted blocks of type, but artful combinations of word and image. William Dean Howells, describing'the creation of a fictional magazine, Every Other Week, in his 1890 novel A Hamrd of New Fortunes, showed the editor and owner realizing that they must hire an art director. He, in turn, commissioned what Howells calls "graphlcal comments" appropriate to each sto~y.. Eventually, the Gesamtkunstwerk of the American magazine adopted a particular, co[llll1ercial form. Publishers learned that they could cut subscription and newsstand prices radically, so long as they sold enough ads to recoup the loss they made on every copy of their magazine. Richard Ohmann and others have shown that as advertising itself became more professional, editors offered to work with advertisers and the makers of products, turning their magazines into magasins in the French sense: colleruons of attractive products, some to be read and others to be bought, rather like the Sears catalogue of the

same period. They encouraged readers to take a serious interest in advertising by running contests for new slogans, producing series of advertising collections that could be removed from the magazines and collected in albums, and even allowing writers to mention particular products, favorably, in their stories. Most important, the form of the magazine mutated, as editors introduced the new practice of "ad-streaming." Like Web sites, magazines used advertising to generate their income stream, they adopted as their standard form a long ribbon of text that unrolled between colorful ads, and they demanded that readers develop new skills. . The experienced reader soon learned how to consume each magazine: not in a sin!l'e, uniform way, like the old, learned quarterlies, which had confronted readers with immense blocks of text, but as a collection of materials useable for different purposes. Early in the 1950s, a New Yorker reader wrote · in to the magazine that each copy was "as efficiently used up around here as the packing plants' claim for their pork. The covers go in an art scrap book, cartoon,s & quips clipped and sent to a brother in Korea, & the fiction & book .. ' reviews( are passeled out among less fortunate acquaintances who have eame~y good will."26 Some _critics deplored the· fact that illustrated newspapefs and magazines, designed for a world in which "the rhythm of life pounds short and hard," did not foster the "tranquil and concentrated focus" 'and "surrender" demanded of the true reader. They noted querulously that ' the new emphasis on visuarinformation was designed to give a magazine "impact" in a life too hectic to allow the .individuals to read (both remarks were made by German critics in the1920s, lamenting the Americanization of German magatine cuitore.) The oddly familiar language of these critiques remihds us that our media landscape retains, and will retain, elements that wct\J.ld . have been . familiar generations ago. , ';f,he newspapers and magazines of the early years of the century did not have the near-total flexibility of the modern Web site, and their readers could not skip from one hot link to the next. But their mixture of commerce and culture, fueir juxtapositions of serious and trivial contents, and their ~bility to confront readers with the shock of the new were as wid~ly. noticed-and sometimes as forcefully deplored-by contemporaries as the similar features of the.Web. Like the Web, too, the new magazines and newspapers invited their readers to see themselves as members ofa single community. The evidence suggests that they often succeeded. Readership

320

surveys collected information about audience response; readers'
identified particular stories and articles as controversial or rewarding;

readers of magazines as diverse as the Saturday Evening Post and the Yorker professed that they kept their subscriptions because-as wrote to the latter-it says "what I think and feel"; "It has to be good because we agree with everything you say." Those who sent in such sages, as a study of the New Yorker by Mary Corey has established, in<:luc1eel
a bird curator at a museum, a UN official, an editor, doctors, enlisted men,

a British war bride and a former chorus boy-about as diverse a group as have ever shared any serious interest." In some ways, the world ofwriitina has not so much been transformed as restored to a ghostly, faster-m1oving< simulacrum of the media world of half a century ago. By contrast, the world of serious reading does seem to be changing, in related ways. As readers gain private, off-site access to treasures once fined to the British and New York Public Libraries, they may stay home in : their -pajamas rather than schlepping in; like the hard-pressed content providers in George Gissing's New Grub Stree~ to the Valley of the 'Shadow of the Book. Even in the great years of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century metropolitan library, after all,. the greatest scholars-the historian Leopold von: Ranke, for ~ample, or the social scientist Werner Sombart-did most of their work in their-own enormous collections. In Berlin, where great profes· .· sors were public figures, ricbly paid, these might contain as many as 30,000 books. It is hard to feel anything but pleasure at the thought that Google may enable impoverished graduate students to emulate the mandarins ofyesterday, and work where they like. Yet great city and university libraries have long been America's symbolic centers of culture-the nurseries of Kazins and Hofstadters. Traditionally, they have occnpied the grandest of publis buildings---m~terial, ·public testimony to the powers of the book. Pursuing one's studies in an environment like this was a way of learning an artisanal craft. Librarians, older scholars, and graduate students passed on informal advice. The librai:y's own ways of collecting information--'like the magnificent subject cards. in the old New York Public Library catalogue---rlirected the reader to extraordinary finds. And a sighting of a celebrity like Frank Manuel or Barbara Tnchman could leave a young student vibrating for weeks with the sense that hard work ·might lift bne from the Valley of the "Shadow to Parriassus.

A number of great American cities have recently built big central librarleB, range in style from neo-Beaux-Arts celebrations of the traditional cui· of the book to bright, glassy, open civic centers. And as Witold Rybczyn· ·pointed out in a recent "slide-show essay" in Slate, the heavy facades and elegant, sterile reading rooms of the libraries in Chicago and San Francisco seem to be crying out "Books still matter! Conan the Librarian is still in charge!" to a public that shows little interest. By contrast, the newer libraries in Seattle and Kansas City are hip, appealing structures that deliberately de'part from tradition. Rem Koolhaas did not even equip his ziggurat in Seattle with a reading room. These buildings pull in crowds composed of everyone, from graduate students to tourists to homeless people." The lesson Rybczynski draws is simple. Books have probably passed their sell-by date, as some prophets claim. Libraries, as such, are dinosaurs, doomed to elClinction. But build a really attractive building and call it a centrallibrary-a mall with natura! light, interesting spaces, and a comic book shop, like the new library in Salt Lake City-and the punters will come. Not for the books, but for the !'J'citement and the human connections tbat only a great public space can generate. Libraries, in otb<;r words, can survive. But if they insist on their original mis~ion, they will turn into enormous, handsome ghost ships, sailing along with..al!lights on and no passengers. On the other hand, if administrators decide_ that they can save libraries by sweeping all their dusty, old-fashioned books into off-site storage and filling their cavernous, loftlike spaces with the cafes and fast computers that might woo the crowds back, these treasure. houses will degenerate into bigger versions of Starbucks or Barnes & Noble: splendid public spaces that people frequent to use electronic sources,-most of whic:!t they could lind anywhere: Neither fate seems desirable: and neither will restqre the old function of the library as a training center for the crafts of scholarship. I As the books head for off-site warehouses, moreover, reading itself seems · to be under threat. Th~ neWspapers and magazines of the years around 1900 coexisted with more stable forms of writing-above all the serious book~ . and presupposed the superiority of engaged, informed study of texts even when they did not promote it. By contrast, the hot link and the search engine· seem to symbolize a particular postmodern way of approaching texts: rapid, superficial, appropriative, and individualistic. Readers do not need to master catalogues, to walk stacks, to use bibliographies---much less to work

322

'.

through stacks of books. All they need to do is enter a word or two into Google and compile the results. Some fear that the old-fashioned scholar's memory, stored with texts not only read, but digested and turned into marrow and bone, and the old-fashioned reader's deep play with novels and poetry studied for years, have given way to endless bricolage, mosaics assembled by students and writers who know only the bits of texts they pull from the screen. Listen, for example, to Jonathan Barnes, a specialist on ancient philosophy, describe what the computer database of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG)-a searchable, full-text archive of ancient Greek texts-has done for his field: Load it into your laptop, and you have instant access to virtually the whole ·of Greek literature. You cut and paste snippets from authors whose very names mean nothing to you. You affirm-and you're right-that a particular word used here by Plato occurs 43 times elsewhere in Greek literature. And you c..;, write an article-or a bookstuffed. with prodigious learning. (There are similar things available for Latin.) . :. The TLG is a lovely little 'resource (I think that's the word) and I use her all tl:te time. But she's strumpet-tongued: she flatters and she deceives. "what an enormous knowledge you have, my young cock-why not )enne make a real .scholar of you?" And the young cock crows on his dung-hill: he can cite anything and construe nothing." Barnes's. description of the siren song of the TLG will bring no pleasure to anyone who spends time, for example, grading papers or evaluating the work ofyoung writers. The 200,000 titles compiled by a single entrepreneur, Philip Parker, with the aid of algorithms and a staff of programmers, offer a preview of an~gly future. The shortcuts Barnes describes so witheringly are not confined to classics: in fact, they represent one version of what looks like a period style of approaching text. A report recently conimissioned by the British Library and the Joint Information Systems Committee details the reading practices of contemporary university students, using data drawn from actual search strings. Most students begin their searches for information at Google, rather than a library Web page that lists more refined search engines. Those who consult e-book sites stay on them for an average of four minutes. True,

, .The Book Dematerializes

323

students who consult e-journals stay longer: eight minutes) on average. But

around 60 percent of them look at no more than three pages of the article in question, and the majority never return to the site. The reading that most students do on the Web takes the form of "dipping," "cross-checking," and "power skimming"-just as the traditionalists croak.

Future Reading For now and for the foreseeable future, any serious reader will have to know how to travel down two very different roads simultaneously, No one should avoid the broad, smooth, and open road that leads through the screen into an electronic paradise of texts and images. But if you want to know what one of Coleridge's annotated books or an early "Spiderman" comic really looks and , feels }ike, or if you just want to read one of those_ millions of books that are being digitized but cannot as yet be opened and read-you still have to do it the old way, and you will have to for decades to come. At Kazin's beloved New York Public Library, the staff loves electronic media. The library has · made hundreds of thousands of images from its collections ac<:essible on the Web, and Google is digitizing more ·than a million ~ooks from the stacks. Still, the library has done all ihis in the knowledge that its collections comprise 53 million items. To ensure that as many of these as possible find users, it must keep bums on pews and books and documents in front of readers. When Paul Holdengraber, the. ambassador to New York from the lost realms· of European learning, organizes sellout events at Live from the New York Public Library, which thousands more hear as podcasts; or David Ferrerio, who runs the library system day to day, opens Central Branch for the first time to children, they have ""any ends in vie'Y· One is to provide the electronic media that New Yorkers need, in a setting that is no!;_ only disciplined and peaceful, but welcoming. Another, and no less important, is to keep the books and manuscripts alive ·by continuing to forge a. democratic public that will come to them. Sit in your local coffee shop and your laptop can tell you a lot, especially if you wield your search terms adeptly. But if you want deeper, more local knowledge, you will still have to take the narrower path-that leads between the lions and up the stone stairs. There-as in great libraries around the worldyou will use all the new sources, all the time. You will check musicians' names

324

CODEX IN CRISIS

and dates at Grove Music Online, read Marlowe's Doctor Faustus on Google Books or EEBO, or savor the idiosyncrasies of British justice as exhibited in the online proceedings of the Old Bailey. But these streams of data, rich as they are, will illuminate rather than eliminate the unique books and prints and manuscripts that only the library can put in front of you. For now, and for the foreseeable future, if you want to piece together the richest possible mosaic of documents and texts and images, you will have to do it in those crowded public rooms where sunlight gleams on varnished tables, as it has for more than a century, and knowledge is still embodied in millions of dusty, crumbling, smelly, irreplaceable manuscripts and books.

ick up a modern book. This one will do: the one you are looking at right now. What sort of object is this? There are certain features about it of which you can be reasonably confident. Its professed author does indeed exist and did indeed write it. It contains information believed to be accurate, and it professes to impart knowledge to readers like you. It is produced with its author's consent, and it is indeed the edition it claims to be. If the dust jacket announces that it is the product of a given organization-in this case the University of Chicago Press-then this too may be believed. Perhaps you may even say to yourself that that fact vouches for the quality of its content. You may safely assume that the book you now hold will have been printed in many copies, and a copy of the same book bought in Australia, say, will be identical in all relevant respects to one bought in the United States or in Great Britain. Begin to use this object. It should immediately become clear that there are things about its proper utilization of which a reader like you can be equally confident. This book has not been produced with a specific, individual reader in mind. To some extent, at least, it is a commercial product, designed to appeal to purchasers. Its cost may have limited its readership somewhat, but its distribution will still have been fairly widespread, and it may be available for consultation in a number of libraries. Readers will not have to endure any formal vetting or approval process before being permitted to read this book. You yourself are free to carry it around and to lend it to others. You are not free, however-beyond certain legal limits-to reproduce its contents in your own right for commercial gain. Nor may you now proceed to issue translations, epitomes, or abridgments of those contents. It is improbable (but not impossible) that you will choose to declaim the text of this book aloud in a public place, and it is even more unlikely that you will make it the focus of a collective act of commemoration, worship, or similar ritual. Some books are indeed used in these ways, incidentally, but this is probably not going to be one of them. In short, while in

some respects this book's usage is up to you, in others it appears to be quite closely constrained. That we can assume all these things of such an object-that such an object actually exists-derives from our living in what many people call "print culture." Such phenomena, we say, are due to printing. Or rather, we would say this, but so infallibly reliable are they that we rarely even have to articulate the relation. It is obvious, self-evident, even necessary. The practical consequence is that we do not have to agonize over the reliability of a published book before we can put it to use. We do not need to undertake investigatory work to confirm that its author does exist and that its text is authorized. No literary spy need be hired to ascertain that it was indeed made by its stated publisher and that its contents will be the same as those of another copy of the same book found in any other place. In our world, all these characteristics are inherent in virtually any published book (and the duties of a "literary agent" are comparatively mundane). We take them for granted, every day of our lives. We depend on them, and our reliance is, by and large, justified. It is this very self-evidence that encourages us to ascribe all these characteristics to a technological order of reality. Ifcalled upon, we may assert that printed texts are identical and reliable because that is simply what printing is. The identification is as momentous as it is straightforward. It has become the point of departure for all current interpretations of print and its cultural consequences, and is the root from which the very concept of "print culture" has grown. 1 It is thereby also the foundation of a conviction that that culture has rendered possible the establishment of veracious knowledge in modern society. Yet this book argues that it is substantially false. Not only that: The Nature ofthe Book maintains that it is probably the most powerful force resisting the acceptance ofa truly historical understanding ofprint and any cultural consequences it may foster. This book contends that what we often regard as essential elements and necessary concomitants of print are in fact rather more contingent than generally acknowledged. Veracity in particular is, it argues, extrinsic to the press itself, and has had to be grafted onto it. The same may be said of other cognate attributes associated with printing. In short, The Nature ofthe Book claims that the very identity of print itself has had to be made. It came to be as we now experience it only by virtue of hard work, exercised over generations and across nations. That labor has long been overlooked, and is not now evident. But its very obscurity is revealing. It was dedicated to effacing its own traces, and necessarily so: only if such efforts disappeared could

printing gain the air of intrinsic reliability on which its cultural and commercial success could be built. Recovering it is therefore a difficult task, but one well worth attempting. This book tries accordingly to excavate the complex issues involved in the historical shaping of print-issues that our conventional notion of print culture obscures with all the authority of a categorical definition. The Nature ofthe Book is the first real attempt to portray print culture in the making. Yet how could print conceivably be anything else? If it were really the result of a significant process of historical construction, then surely we could not now find it so obvious, universal, and undeniable. If it could have developed differently, then surely it would now differ noticeably from place to place, and in anyone place it would still bear the traces of its development. We would see the wreckage of failed alternatives all about us. In practical terms, we would indeed have to worry about the specific status of a given printed book in order to use it. Questions of where it had come from, who had made it, and whether or not its putative author acknowledged its content would all need to be posed and answered before we could safely trust any printed book. That they do not constitutes a powerful reason to accept the obvious. Even a little reflection suggests that there is greater complexity to the subject than this. Any printed book is, as a matter of fact, both the product of one complex set of social and technological processes and also the starting point for another. In the first place, a large number of people, machines, and materials must converge and act together for it to come into existence at all. How exactly they do so will inevitably affect its finished character in a number of ways. In that sense a book is the material embodiment of, if not a consensus, then at least a collective consent. Its identity can be understood accordingly, in terms of these intricate processes. But the story of a book evidently does not end with its creation. How it is then put to use, by whom, in what circumstances, and to what effect are all equally complex issues. Each is worthy of attention in its own right. So a printed book can be seen as a nexus conjoining a wide range of worlds of work. Look closely and you are likely to find simplicity and inevitability in neither the manufacture of an object like this nor its subsequent construal. The processes leading to the deployment of a book and those consequent upon its use both depend on too many contingencies. That in turn means that print cannot be as straightforward as it seems. One way to appreciate the implications is to examine more closely places where printing exists, but where its cultural consequences seem very different from those familiar to us. There are two such places, separated from us by space and by time. The first may be found in certain regions of the world where, to international publishers' disgust, so-called "piracy" has become a

4

CHAPTER ONE

prevalent commercial practice. You could not be so sure of all those "selfevident" facts about this book if you had bought your copy in such a place. It might indeed prove reliable. But it might also have been produced by an anonymous manufacturer, and have different contents. Its purported author might have no idea of the claims it contained. Some such companies produce not just unauthorized reprints of existing books, but wholly new texts claiming to be written by best-selling authors. Their products threaten to compromise both the economic production of authorized works and, by generating correspondingly divergent readings, their reception. The potential effects are suggested by the most notorious of all recent controversies to arise from publishing. The author Salman Rushdie was complaining of piracy of his works in Pakistan and India long before the appearance of his Satanic Verses. When it did appear, the book was properly published in neither country; the protests that occurred in Lahore and elsewhere, and that first set in train the events leading eventually to Khomeini's fatwa, centered on the public reading of unauthorized copies and photocopied extracts. A Penguin representative even noted that piracy would permit readers to circumvent the Indian government's subsequent ban on the book. 2 Rushdie's is admittedly an extreme case. But for good or ill, countless authors and publishers have encountered to some degree the loss of control induced by piracy. It means that the experiences associated with print are indeed different from those familiar to most Western readers. And any suggestion that the intrinsic cultural consequences of technology have simply been inadequately realized in such settings would be difficult to endorse. The evidence of recent international trade disputes indicates that modern technology, far from eliminating such practices, may even be facilitating them. The arguments currently raging over such matters are intense and important. Few claim to know how they will end. 3 The alternative is to look not to other places in our own time, but to other times in our own place. It is possible to argue not only that print may differ from place to place, but also that its nature has changed over time even in our own society. If this is so, the implications are again substantial, but in rather different ways. Such an argument compels us to reappraise where our own concept of print culture comes from, how it developed, w?en it took hold, and why its sway continues to seem secure. These are

3. These disputes extend far beyond "copyright" as conventionally understood, and include conventions now being forged to cover the "inventions" and "texts" produced in areas such as biotechnology and genome research. The economic, cultural, and moral implications at stake in these, as in the battles raging over computer and music software. are truly massive. For confrontations between the USA and China over the latter, see Faison, "Copyright Pirates."

some of the questions addressed in the following chapters. Tactically forgetting that we ourselves "know" what printing is, The Nature ofthe Book begins by asking the question ofwhat printing was. It addresses how the people of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries constructed and construed the craft, in their own setting and for their own ends. This entails comprehending the complex social processes by which books came to be made and used in their society-the society in which printing first really thrived, and in which any consequences it might have were first fully manifested. The result is that what began as a tactical decision to forget our own knowledge is soon vindicated as rather more. As chapter 2 will show in detail, early modern printing was not joined by any obvious or necessary bond to enhanced fidelity, reliability, and truth. That bond had to be forged. If an early modern reader picked up a printed book-De Natura Libri, perhaps-then he or she could not be immediately certain that it was what it claimed to be, and its proper use might not be so self-evident. Piracy was again one reason: illicit uses of the press threatened the credibility of all printed products. More broadly, ideas abour the correct ways to make and use books varied markedly from place to place and time to time. But whatever the cause, it is not easy for us to imagine such a realm, in which printed records were not necessarily authorized or faithful. What could one know in such a realm, and how could one know it? We ourselves rourinely rely on stable communications in our making and maintenance of knowledge, whether of the people around us or of the world in which we live. That stability helps to underpin the confidence we feel in our impressions and beliefs. Even the brisk skepticism we may express about certain printed materials-tabloid newspapers, say-rests on it, inasmuch as we feel confident that we can readily and consistently identify what it is that we are scorning. Instability in records would equally rapidly translate into uncertainty of judgment. The most immediate implication, then, would be epistemic. In a sense, the point is a well-entrenched one. It has been made at least since the sixteenth century, when printers and others took to lauding their craft for its power to preserve. The contrast they drew was with previous scribal forms of reproduction, which they delineated as intrinsically corruptive. It now seems almost indisputable. We should recognize, however, that the first identification of that contrast was partly a product of interest. Printers stood to gain from what was originally a contentious argument, not a straightforward observation. If, on the other hand, it is not printing per se that possesses preservative power, but printing put to use in particular ways, then we ourselves may usefully draw some rather different distinctions. We may look not just for differences between print and manuscript reproduction, but for different ways in which the press itself and its products have been (and continue to be) employed. The roots of textual stability may be

6

CHAPTER ONE

sought as much in these practices as in the press itself. And knowledge, such as it is, has come to depend on that stability. Here, then, is one way in which a social history of print can prove not just interesting, but consequential. A reappraisal of print in the making can contribute to our historical understanding of the conditions of knowledge itself.
TYCHO BRAHE, GALILEO GALILEI, AND THE PROBLEMS OF "PRINT CULTURE"

The central concern of this book is the relation between print and knowledge. As its title suggests, to pursue this theme it focuses in particular on natural knowledge-knowledge of Creation and of humanity's place within it. To that extent, The Nature ofthe Book may be regarded as contributing to the discipline known, rather anachronistically, as the history of science. 4 It proposes a new account of how early modern Europeans put printing to use to create and maintain knowledge about the natural world. The focus on the history of science is not, however, an exclusive one. The ambit of The Nature ofthe Book is not exhausted by scientific knowledge, and none of its conclusions should be regarded as restricted to science alone. Science is treated here as just one among a range of activities characterized by the creation and use of knowledge. The historical problems identified in the course of this book were so general that they applied to all of them, from scriptural exegesis, through astronomy, experiment, and alchemy, to the formation of political ideologies and representations of gender. All make their appearances in the following chapters. Nonetheless, the widely accepted status of modern science as the most objective, valuable, and robust kind of knowledge currently available makes it a peculiarly appealing subject for the historian of printing. 5 This high status means that any conclusions demonstrable for science stand a chance of being accredited a fortiori for other activities now held in lower repute. Furthermore, the history of science offers an unusually clear opportunity to discuss the assumptions and implications of the historiography of print. For it is in the history of science that one finds the figure who, more than any other, personifies print culture as conventionally understood. That figure is the Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe (fig. 1.1).
4. As explained further below, I share other historians' doubts about using the terms "science" and "scientist" in reference to periods before they became recognized by contemporaries, and will therefore employ them sparingly in this book. For the issues involved, see Jardine, "Writing Off the Scientific Revolution"; Copenhaver, "Did Science Have a Renaissance?"; Pickstone, "Past and Present Knowledges"; and the polemical argument in Cunningham and Williams, "De-centring the 'Big Picture.''' 5. I should stress the attributive and pragmatic character of such a representation; claims that scientific knowledge actually is objective are, of course, extremely controversial, and the image of science as such has been questioned many times.

In 1576 the king of Denmark granted Tycho feudal powers over a small island named Hven, lying in the sound just north of Copenhagen. Here Tycho erected a remarkable castle-observatory, in which he lived and worked for the next two decades. His work at this palatial observatory, which he called Uraniborg (fig. 1.2), resulted in an unequaled series of observations and interpretations of the heavens. They secured for him a reputation as the greatest of all astronomers. Almost immediately, Tycho himself became an icon of the very enterprise of astronomy. Mathematical practitioners in succeeding generations came to see in him an unimpugnable model of the harmony of nobility and "mechanic" skill. In the hands of modern historians, moreover, Tycho has again proved a powerful emblem, in two important and revealingly paradoxical respects. First, Uraniborg has become the outstanding Renaissance exemplar of the importance of locale in the making of knowledge. 6 This is an important issue, to be addressed
6. Hannaway, "Laboratory Design." Shackelford has responded to Hannaway, with more heat than really necessary, in ''Tycho Brahe."

10

CHAPTER ONE

later in this chapter. At the same time, however, Tycho has come to personify the role of print in transcending place and rendering natural knowledge universal. He has thus become emblematic of the transformation of local craft into global science. This latter apotheosis has been due above all to Elizabeth Eisenstein's The Printing Press as an Agent ofChange. Published in 1979, this is still probably the most influential anglophonic interpretation of the cultural effects of printing. Yet The Nature ofthe Book pursues for the most part a quite different approach from hers. A consideration of Tycho Brahe provides the ideal opportunity to specify how and why it does SO.7 The unifying concept of Eisenstein's argument is that of "print culture." This "culture" is characterized primarily in terms of certain traits that print is taken to endow on texts. Specifically, those produced in such an environment are subject to conditions of standardization, dissemination, and fixity. The last of these is perhaps the most important. According to Eisenstein, printing meant the mass reproduction of precisely the same text, repeatable on subsequent occasions and in different locations. No longer need any work suffer the increasing corruption that Eisenstein assumes to be endemic to any "script culture." She focuses on this attribute of fixity as the most important corollary of the press, seeing it as central to most of the effects of print culture. 8 For example, in conditions of fixity the simple practice of juxtaposing texts became immensely significant. Newly available printed representations of opposing astronomical, anatomical, or other knowledge could be placed side by side, and their viewer could now be confident that conclusions drawn from comparing such reliable texts would be worthwhile. Correspondents on the other side of Europe could do the same, with representations that could be supposed identical. 9 Such scholars no longer needed to concern themselves primarily with the fidelity of their representations, and were freed from spending their lives eradicating scribal mistakes. It was fixity that liberated them from such labor and thus made possible the progressive improvement of knowledge. This is the basis on which
7. Eisenstein, Printing Press, abridged as Printing Revolution. For examples of Eisenstein's influence in a range of fields, see Tribble, Margins and Marginality, 3- 4; Neuschel, Word of Honor, chap. 6; Olson, World on Paper, 37 and passim; Rose, Authors and Owners, 3-4; Sommerville, Secularization, 48, 70, 79, 178, 180, 219 n. I; Anderson, Imagined Communities, 30-49; Eamon, Science and the Secrets ofNature, 6-9, 94-6; Lowood and Rider, "Literary Technology and Typographic Culture" (where "typographic culture" and "print culture" are indistinguishable). Many more could be cited. It is difficult to be sure, but I would estimate that Tycho Brahe is referred to at least as frequently in Printing Press as any other Renaissance figure. 8. Eisenstein, Printing Press, 71-88, II3-26. 9. Eisenstein, Printing Press, 74-5, 597; Printing Revolution, 42-88. It is worth pointing out that these phenomena are similar to those attributed by anthropologists to the invention of writing, e.g., in Goody, Logic ofWriting, 134-8, 174.

INTRODUCTION

Eisenstein can claim that the Renaissance and Reformation were rendered permanent by the very permanence of their canonical texts, that nationalism developed thanks to the stabilization of laws and languages, and that science itself became possible on the basis of phenomena and theories reliably recorded. 10 With this new foundation ofcertainty at their disposal, "scientists" (as Eisenstein insists on calling them) could begin to develop new doubts about their previous authority, namely antiquity. The "Scientific Revolution" was thus inconceivable without a preceding printing revolution. I I And for Eisenstein Tycho Brahe personifies both. Eisenstein's Tycho was an autodidact. This in itself was remarkable: before the printing revolution, not enough faithful editions could have been amassed in one place to enable him to teach himself. But while he was doing this, Tycho was able to place authoritative printed representations of the Copernican and Ptolemaic systems of the heavens side by side before his eyes. By this simple process of juxtaposition, he could immediately see that there were serious discrepancies. Later, working on Hven, he instigated a program to rectify the data and theories on which astronomy was based. He and his assistants labored for years to produce a systematic corpus of recorded observations of the heavenly bodies, using not only Tycho's own careful observations but those sent to him by astronomers across central Europe. When ready, Tycho could then supervise the correct printing of this vital material in his own printing house, using paper made in his own paper mill (figs. 1.3 and 1.4). As a result, one nova-"Tycho's star," as it came to be called-became "fixed" to the extent that it continued to be shown on celestial globes long after it had disappeared from the sky. 12 In this guise has Eisenstein's Tycho entered a current debate over science itself. Bruno Latour has built an account of the making and power ofscience on her representation of a print culture, first in his concept of "immutable mobiles" 13 and more recently in that of "mediators." 14 Latour identifies the collection and deployment of durable paper entities as the foundation

of science's success. The creation and circulation of such objects, Latour maintains, enabled Tycho to master natural and social entities that were otherwise beyond reach. He could use print both to capture heavenly bodies, as Eisenstein claimed, and, furthermore, effectively to turn every observatory in Europe into an extension of Uraniborg. This he achieved by distributing printed forms on which astronomers could enter their observations before returning them to the central site of Hven. 15 In doing so, he pioneered a practice central to the development of modern science. For this, Latour thinks, is essentially how the modern laboratory sustains its authority too. The Latourian laboratory is an inscription engine, dedicated to the construction, collation, dispersal, and accommodation of such materials. It is a compelling and enormously influential argument. And it is consonant not only with Eisenstein herself, but more extensively still with her inspiration and bete noire, Marshall McLuhan. 16 Latour's vision of science in

A plausible summary of McLuhan's views in relation to Latour's might run as follows. Like Latour, McLuhan urged the importance of what he called the "network" as a category of analysis, important in deciding ways of perceiving the world. He too identified a railway system as the representative network par excellence (compare Latour, we Have Never Been Modern, II?; and Latour, Aramis). What McLuhan's networks achieve-what lends them their power-is their ability to produce changes in scale. They permit individuals and organizations to localize and universalize by allowing them to magnifY and reduce traces of the

action depends on Eisenstein's "print culture"-and thereby implicitly on McLuhan's "Gutenberg Galaxy"-to underwrite the stability of both knowledge and society. I? The Tycho of Eisenstein and Latour has become the incarnation of textual, social, and epistemic order. But just how credible is this Tycho? There is something altogether too neat, too immaculate, about the figure and his achievements. As Philip Marlowe put it in The Big Sleep, such testimony displays "the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled woof of fact." 18 Maybe the Tycho so far portrayed will change somewhat ifwe investigate more closely how his "mediators" actually came into being and were put to use. For Tycho does indeed represent perhaps the purest example of a particular kind of printing, and a particular way of using the products of the press. Like Regiomontanus before him, and Hevelius after, he controlled his own printing operation. His was a singular printing house, however. It was as geographically isolated on the island of Hven as it was socially isolated from the companies of the European book trade. It was even physically embedded in the five-meter high, five-meter thick wall that enclosed his entire estate. Such isolation meant, at least in principle, that Tycho could produce books when, for whom, and in whatever form he liked. 19 Works like his Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica, which described Uraniborg in all its glory, were scarcely intended to be published at all, but were to be distributed as gifts to patrons at courts and universities (fig. 1.5). The more prestigious were not just printed books, but hybrids-hand-colored, individualized tributes, presented to their intended recipients on specific dates. 2o Tycho meant to bypass the structures of the international book trade altogether.
things on which they wish to operate to roughly the same size without destroying them. The "message" of his networks is that they permit such control; and what is perceived as reality is in fact the current state of competing networks in dynamic interaction. The boundary between natural and social must therefore be forgotten when considering them. In such a world of natural/social hybrids, power comes from "translation." This is the agency by which we "enlarge the scope of [our] action" and affect sites distant from ourselves. See McLuhan, Understanding Media, 3-21, 56-61, 89-105, 338-45, 346-59; compare Latour, Science in Action, 108-21, 223-32, 247-57, and We Have Never Been Modern, 10-12, 49-142. A reassessment of McLuhan is, I think, overdue, though attention to his work is currently reviving. Eisenstein herself roundly denied following him, but with an insistence and a perseverance that almost amounted to protesting too much: e.g., Printing Press, ix-xi, xvii, 40-1, 88, 129,171. 17.

The recipient of a book like Tycho's Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica was thus likely to be found in a distinctive place: a royal court or a university. Here a book took its place and gained its meaning only amid a vast arsenal of other objects directed to similar ends. It would be encountered alongside natural curiosities, thaumaturgical wonders, mathematical devices, paintings, musical compositions, alchemical medallions, magical machines, and other books (fig. 1.6). In such surroundings, every aspect of appearance and handling mattered for creating an impact. The reader of such a work, in such a place, would be consciously engaging in a distinctive system of practices and ideas-in Tycho's case, feudal ones. The giving and receiving of such gifts was an important part of court culture, enmeshed in conventions of status recognition, reciprocation, and reward. This could not fail to affect the way in which that reader regarded the book. It was invested with enhanced credit, being untainted by "mechanick" influence, and it was accorded the privileged reception due to such a noble gesture. 21 The veracity of its contents warranted respect. They could not be dismissed without cost. Yet at the same time such a gesture all but commanded creative responsesincluding challenges-from suitably prestigious interlocutors. Tycho's book would now fall subject to the conventions surrounding philosophical and mathematical dispures in these settings. The variables that determined both whether a "scientific" debate would even take place, and, once battle had been joined, how it would proceed, were local ones: to whom one pre21.

sented the book, through which channels it was distributed, with which patron it was identified. Disputes like this were affairs of honor, conducted through appropriate intermediaries and champions. Printed books were their vehicles. That was what they were for. 22 When, therefore, Tycho found himself attacked by Nicolai Reymers Baer (or Ursus), a recognized mathematician but a man of low birth whom he himself had accused of plagiarism, a scientific debate was not the principal outcome. Rather unusually, Tycho did in fact deign to reply himself. But

he did so with a series of elaborately indignant letters to his fellows across Europe, which he had printed on his press at Uraniborg and circulated in 1596. In this correspondence he recited the tale ofUrsus's alleged theft and argued that, whatever the date ofUrsus's publication, Tycho had printed the cosmology first. Ever willing to recall his opponent's low birth, he even seems to have suggested that Ursus be executed for his presumption. But the more philosophical side of the dispute he delegated to a second, the relatively humble Kepler. The result was Kepler's "Defense ofTycho against Ursus," a remarkably sophisticated historical argument for the status of astronomical hypotheses and their creators. It was never printed. 23 Much even of this story could be taken as reinforcing Eisenstein's image. However, two elements make it less confirmatory. The first is that Tycho was extremely atypical in his successful use of print. Other writers regarded him not as representative of their own situation, but as a model that they sought, with widely varying degrees of success, to emulate. Like most icons, he stood for an ideal that was unrealizable. The second is that, as his argument against Ursus implies, even Tycho himself found the ideal impossible to achieve. That was why he built his own printing house and paper mill: he discovered that he could not otherwise obtain acceptable materials and workmanship.24 Even with these in place, moreover, most of his work remained unprinted until after his death. 25 Latour's preprinted forms, for example, seem to be mythical; Tycho did correspond extensively, but left no trace of having used such objects. 26 And while he began producing the images and descriptions for the Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica as early as

cho's decision to strike at Ursus personally (which Kepler, for one, found surprising) may well be related to the fact that, as Hannaway points out, his status was feudal in origin; Tycho was not a courtier. See Hannaway, "Laboratory Design," 589 n. II. For Tycho's conflicts see also Gingerich and Westman, Wittich Connection (which contrasts Tycho's treatment ofUrsus to his response to the relatively well-born Wittich), and Thoren, Lord ofUraniborg. I am grateful to Robert Westman for conversations about this affair, which remains one of the more controversial among scholars of early modern astronomy. 24.

Even with the mill in working order, he remained reliant on the cooperation of nearby parishioners to provide raw materials, as they were exhorted to do in regular "rag sermons." 25. In particular, the star catalogue (circulated only in manuscript until years after Tycho's death, and then inaccurately printed) and the Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata (begun at Uraniborg, but completed only under the aegis of his heirs in 1602). 26. I have found no trace of these preprinted forms in Tycho's Opera Omnia, nor in any relevant secondary authority. I am also unable to find Latour's source for this central claim; it may well derive from an imaginative reading of certain passages in Eisenstein's Printing Press, e.g., 626-7.

CHAPTER ONE

1585, soon after building his printing house, the volume was not completed until thirteen years later. By that time he was in exile in Hamburg-the only place he could find with printers capable of finishing the book, even though he had brought his own press with him from Hven. Taken by his son to the Holy Roman Emperor, the book now became an instrument in Tycho's attempt to secure imperial patronage. 27 This proved successful, and he removed to Prague. But he soon discovered that even here, in the center of the empire, no printer able to undertake his prized star catalogue could be found. He was reduced to circulating hand-copied versions, and the catalogue remained unprinted on his death (fig. 1.7).28 At that point his works began to fallout of court circles altogether. They descended into the hands of the book trade. Even the Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica was reprinted commercially. Such books were likely to be produced to different standards. They stood at risk of piracy and imitation, despite Rudolf II's stern commands forbidding such "printers' frauds." They were also likely to be read in different ways, by different people, in different places and for different reasons. Their accreditation became far more insecure. So, for example, the English astronomer royal, John Flamsteed-who, as we shall see, identified himself profoundly with Tycho-dismissed the posthumous printing of his star tables as, quite simply, a "fraud." 29 Tycho's inscriptions appear to have become distinctly mutable once they fell out of his control and left the courtly matrix (fig. 1.8). Ifeven Tycho Brahe found it so difficult to maintain his printed materials as mobile and immutable, what hope is there ofexplaining the achievements of less powerful figures in Eisenstein's terms? Attempting to do so would mean attributing to printed books themselves attributes of credibility and persuasion that actually took much work to maintain. It would thereby draw our attention away from important problems that any individual, even Tycho, had to overcome. 30 Talk of "print culture" is strangely ethereal when compared to Tycho's struggles. It stands oddly disconnected from the professed experiences of real historical figures. For example, who actually

For Rudolf II's undertaking to provide a "new Uraniborg," see Brahe, Opera, VIII, 178, 188. It is also likely, of course, that Tycho's circulation of the catalogue in manuscript was intended to enhance its status as a collectible object. 29.

printed (and reprinted) Tycho's pages? It is a question worth asking, since Tycho himself spent many frustrating years seeking suitable printers-and the astronomer Christoph Rothmann, at least, believed that Ursus had been able to plagiarize his world system because he had been employed in Tycho's printing house. 31 And how were those pages employed by their recipients? Of what use were they to them? How did Tycho ensure that such distant readers took them as authoritative, especially when, as was often the case in early modern testimony about celestial observations, they conflicted with figures produced locally? Eisenstein and Latour begin by decreeing such issues peripheral. The Nature ofthe Book does the opposite. If we are to understand how and why printed texts became trustworthy, it argues, we need to appreciate all of them, in something approaching their full "woof." The disconnected air exhibited by Eisenstein's account is not accidental. In her work, printing itself stands outside history. The press is something "sui generis," we are told, lying beyond the reach of conventional historical analysis. Its "culture" is correspondingly placeless and timeless. It is deemed to exist inasmuch as printed texts possess some key characteristic, fixity being the best candidate, and carry it with them as they are transported from place to place. The origins of this property are not analyzed. In fact, the accusations of technological determinism sometimes leveled against Eisenstein may even be wide of the mark, since she consistently declines to specify any position on the question of how print culture might emerge from printY But the example of Tycho does suggest that the focus of her approach is in practice highly selective. The portrait it generates identifies as significant only the clearest instances of fixity. It regards instances when fixity was not manifested as exceptional failures, and even in the successful cases it neglects the labors through which success was achieved. It identifies the results of those labors instead as powers intrinsic to texts. Readers consequently suffer the fate of obliteration: their intelligence and skill is reattributed to the printed page. Tycho's labors deserve better. To put it brutally, what those labors really tell us is that Eisenstein's print culture does not exist. There is an alternative. We may consider fiXity not as an inherent quality, but as a transitive one. That is, it may be more useful to reverse our commonsense assumption. We may adopt the principle that fixity exists only inasmuch as it is recognized and acted upon by people-and not otherwise. The consequence of this change in perspective is that print culture itself is

immediately laid open to analysis. It becomes a result of manifold representations, practices and conflicts, rather than just the monolithic cause with which we are often presented. 33 In contrast to talk ofa "print logic" imposed on humanity,34 this approach allows us to recover the construction ofdifferent print cultures in particular historical circumstances. It recognizes that texts, printed or not, cannot compel readers to react in specific ways, but that they must be interpreted in cultural spaces the character of which helps to decide what counts as a proper reading. In short, this recasting has the advantage of positioning the cultural and the social where they should be: at the center of our attention. IfTycho Brahe has hitherto been made the personification of print culture, then the experiences of his near-contemporary, Galileo Galilei, may in turn stand for this new approach. In 1610, Galileo produced the first of a series of dramatically successful books, called the Sidereus Nuncius. In vivid illustrations, he showed mountains and valleys on the surface of the Moon,

1.8. Iconic representation of the preservation and publication ofTycho Brahe's manuscripts. The four Holy Roman Emperors shown are Rudolf II, Ferdinand II, Ferdinand III, and Leopold 1. These respectively sponsored Tycho's writings (paravit), preserved and digested them into tables (usupavit-which could also mean "usurped"), recovered them from Kepler's family and saved them from damage during the Thirry Years' War (recepit), and published them (publicavit). The motto dedicates the book to the emperors as rulers of the two realms represented by the globes-exerting dominion over the terrestrial world politically, and over the celestial by possession of these manuscripts. The imperial message is reinforced by Ferdinand II's gesture towards Hercules, always a symbol of Hapsburg aspirations. Ironically, the double meaning of the term usupavit could well be apt: Curtius's manuscripts were actually very corrupt copies, which did Tycho's reputation no favors in the eyes of astronomers such as John Flamsteed.

and the discovery of new stars in Orion and the Pleiades (fig. 1.9). These and other "nebulous" regions-the Milky Way in particular-could now be resolved into stars. Above all, however, Galileo revealed four previously unknown satellites revolving about Jupiter, providing a vivid model of Copernican cosmology. This discovery, embodied in a small book, would soon establish him as the foremost philosopher on the Italian peninsula. Yet it

FIG. 1.9. Illustrations of the lunar surface, from the first and three subsequent editions of Galileo Galilei's Sidereus Nuncius. These are perhaps the most famous of all early modern scientific illustrations. They were the first images to show the lunar surface, revealing it to be rough and cratered, and constituted an important element in the campaign to establish the imperfection of this heavenly body. It is especially striking, then, to note the transformations wrought on Galileo's images through their reproduction. Here, the first row (across) of pictures is GaliIeo's own, printed in his Venice edition of the Sidereus Nuncius (1610). The second comes from an unauthorized impression issued almost immediately in Frankfurt. Note that the sequence of the first two pictures has been reversed. Moreover, the exigencies of such unauthorized printing dictated speed and economy, and as a result changed the images themselves. As well as showing degradation in each picture, the first and fourth images of this impression were in fact printed from the same woodcut, rotated through 180°. The third

version reproduced here was issued in London in 1653. It reused the same blocks as the Frankfurt edition, again duplicating the first and fourth images. It also reiterated the sequence of the unauthorized version. So did the fourth version, printed in 1683. By this time the painstakingly crafted verisimilitude of Galileo's original drawings had been significantly eroded-a degradation in which the practices of piratical reproduction had played a large part.

CHAPTER ONE

was not just for the intrinsic value of these observations that the Sidereus Nuncius had such an impact. In fact, Galileo and his allies deployed the book brilliantly to make its success. 35 He was angling to enter the court of an absolute prince, Cosimo II de' Medici, whose family had long been linked iconographically to Jupiter. Paying for the printing himself, Galileo named his new Jovian satellites accordingly. As the "Medicean stars" they formed the centerpiece of the book he now presented to the grand duke. It was not easy. Galileo actually had to change the name in mid-printing, after Medici officials told him that his original choice of "Cosmian" would not meet with approval; the new name was glued over the old on the pages already printed. He then went in person to make the presentation, ensuring that Cosimo would successfully see the new phenomena through his telescope. When Galileo distributed additional copies to princes and cardinals across Europe, along with spyglasses to support his claims, he did so under the carapace of Cosimo himself via the Medici diplomatic service. In promulgating the announcement, Galileo had presented Cosimo with heroic and noble homage, for which the conventions of patronage suggested an appropriate response. When that response came, Galileo declared that his whole "being" had been transformed. Perhaps for the first time, a mathematical practitioner underwent the transfiguration into court philosopher. 36 Galileo was trying to create a new kind of authority on, and for, natural knowledge. The construction of this persona and the elaboration ofhis work in cosmology and mechanics thus took place together, and both rested on the skillful exploitation of patronage dynamics at an absolutist court. The point is a rather subtle one. Patronage was not simply something that could be used as a tool to achieve aims defined by other, perhaps scientific, criteria. It helped constitute at once what were reasonable aims to adopt, what were good claims to make in pursuit of those aims, how they could best be made, and to which audiences. Evidence came into being and was accredited by means of the civil culture of the court. There was no "Galileo, scientist" standing outside this cultural realm and manipulating its mechanisms in order to achieve objective ends. It is important to appreciate this, since at each crucial moment of transition-from Venetian patronage to Florentine, and thence to papal-books were central to Galileo's advance.

Dialogo, which triggered his downfall at the hands of Pope Urban VIII's
Inquisition, books were key elements in any strategy to take advantage of patronage opportunities. 37 At court, what appear to modern eyes to be scientific disputes were seen by participant and spectator alike in these different terms. They would be triggered and structured by Galileo's patron for purposes of diversion and the expression of status. He was expected to produce entertaining and involving debates, and to challenge other court philosophers of sufficient rank. 38 While it was important not to lose such a dispute, it was also important to conduct it properly; and, as Tycho Brahe had known, regular challenges by qualified individuals were imperative to show that one's status was being recognized. So, for example, when the Medici ambassador presented a copy of the Sidereus Nuncius to imperial mathematician Johannes Kepler, he responded correctly with a printed reply dedicated not to Galileo, but to the ambassador. In a sense, Galileo was engaging with Kepler; but Cosimo was also communicating with the Holy Roman Emperor. 39 Unlike Tycho, however, Galileo had no private press. His book fell immediately into the hands of commercial printers. By late 16IO an unauthorized impression had appeared in Frankfurt, his fine illustrations marred by hasty reproduction. For the rest of the century these adulterated images would be reproduced repeatedly. Countless readers saw them-far more, in all likelihood, than ever came upon the authorized originals of what are probably the most momentous astronomical images of their era. 40 Even exempting such piratical enterprises, the social dynamics of challenges were modified by the unavoidable involvement of new personnel and places. The case of Galileo's 1623 work, II Saggiatore, is instructive in this respect. It was printed in April and May in a few hundred copies.

It is perhaps worth adding the rider that the latter edition was unauthorized as far as anyone then or now has known; Galileo (like Isaac Newton later in the century) was quite capable of perpetrating his own "unauthorized" publications. The point remains that he was unable to oversee the production of the work, and in particular that of its illustrations.

book in what looks much more like a process of publication. They did so in order to expose the tactics of a Jesuit antagonist lurking behind the pseudonym of "Lotario Sarsi." They ensured that one of the licenser's copies was delivered early to the Sun bookshop. This was a well-known center for libertine literature, which the Jesuit would surely be monitoring for such works. Its proprietor had agreed to cooperate in the plan. Sure enough, "Sarsi" arrived and seized upon that very copy. He "changed color" on the spot, attacked the bookseller himself as personally responsible for the text, and left declaring loudly that he would take up the challenge and produce a rebuttal within three months. In so doing, he revealed himself as Orazio Grassi, lecturer in mathematics at the Collegio Romano and the Jesuits' most prestigious architect. The bookseller immediately told Galileo's allies of his outburst. Two of them wrote excitedly to their friend to tell him the news, whereupon Galileo came to Rome and successfully preempted Grassi's rebuttal. 41 Access to the bookshop, and the character of both the premises and its proprietor, had transformed the dispute. Here was something quite alien to Tycho's Uraniborg. For Galileo too, however, despite this success it was ultimately to prove an inauspicious development. In the events of his notorious fall not only the printers and booksellers, but the entire licensing and publication mechanism, would be implicated. The Saggiatore incident led directly to this far more significant affair. It began in 1623 with the election of Galileo's ally, Maffeo Barberini, as Pope Urban VIII. This was the spur for Galileo, becalmed in Florence, to seek a position of favor in Rome itself. He did so by using two tools: II Saggiatore itself, which he redirected at the last moment and presented to Urban, and his long-projected Copernican work on the tides. The first of these was a great success. After the incident at the Sun bookshop, Urban had it read to him at table, and seems to have relished its wit and rhetorical dexterity. He began to accord Galileo audiences, in which his favor seemed clear. So clear, in fact, that Galileo probably understood himself released from a private instruction issued some years earlier not to engage in public support for Copernicanism. He returned to Florence and began writing his greater work, which became the momentous Dialogo ... sopra i due Massimi

Sistemi del Mondo. The Dialogo was not immediately or obviously scandalous. In fact, it
successfully underwent an extensive licensing procedure, such that the

stressing that those involved in this plan probably knew "Sarsi's" actual identity throughout; the objective was to get an open declaration from Grassi of the fact, and of his future intentions.

printed edition could boast as many as five imprimaturs. 42 Initially planned to appear in Rome in 1630, it was finally published only in 1632 in Florence. The book was in the event duly licensed in both cities, but nonetheless it caused a stir. Another of Galileo's Jesuit opponents, Christoph Scheiner, immediately repeated Grassi's error by revealing his outrage in front of the bookseller, who dutifully reported it back to his friends. 43 Murmurs soon spread that Galileo had violated Bellarmine's confidential instruction, which was rumored to ban him from even discussing the issue of Copernicanism, let alone supporting it. Events then moved very quickly. In April, Galileo's ally and patronage broker in Rome, Ciampoli, fell from grace, just as Urban came under stringent attack from Spanish interests for insufficient zeal in pursuing the Thirty Years' War and the struggle against heresy. This was a crucial development. Ciampoli was just the kind of intermediary needed by such a book to smooth its progress in courtly circles; he it was who had read If Saggiatore to Urban at table. Without such mediation the Dialogo would soon prove vulnerable, especially as the pope now associated its publication with Ciampoli's newly established impropriety. In these circumstances, what might otherwise have been appreciated as witty dialogic sallies came to be read very differently. Papal sensibilities took its barbs as personal affronts. That summer Urban called in the book, appointing a commission to investigate the circumstances of its appearance. In the autumn he transferred the case to the Inquisition. In February Galileo was summoned to Rome. From April until June negotiations continued in secret. The pope urged the Inquisition on, however, and Galileo was finally resolved to be "vehemently suspected of heresy"-one of the most serious offenses in the Inquisition's ambit. He was forced to abjure, and sentenced to permanent house arrest. 44 Sudden and irrevocable, Galileo's fall has remained one of the most resonant incidents in history, let alone in the history of science. Here, as throughout Galileo's life, the uses of a book had proved crucial to the transformation. This was no Tychonic success story. It would be difficult to identify fixity or immutability as important to the role of the Diafogo at any stage of its story. Galileo's fate was decided by different criteria. His fortunes, and in Mario Biagioli's terms perhaps even his identity, rested on the way in which his book would be read. As scholars working in the last two decades

FROM FIXITY TO CREDIT

A new historical understanding of print is needed. What will it look like? One immediately evident feature will be its regard for the labors of those actually involved in printing, publishing, and reading. Another will be its respect for their own representations of printing, embracing both its prospects and its dangers. The dangers in particular will loom larger and more substantial than they have hitherto. Historians tend to disregard such perils as accidental; early modern readers and writers knew otherwise. They had good cause to fear that in the realm of print seemingly in prospect, authorial control over such efforts as Galileo's would be undermined. More than that, some of them thought that it was already undermined. Increasingly they articulated responses by which the culture of the learned gentleman could be saved from this "mechanick art." Perhaps we should remind ourselves of the extent to which those responses appeared to fail- of the extent to which the print culture of the eighteenth century could be perceived by contemporaries, not as a realization of the rationalizing effects now so often ascribed to the press, but as destabilizing and threatening to civility. Such a stance, artificial though it would be, might help us to distance ourselves from the apparent stability of our own print culture, with its uniform editions, mass reproduction, and typographical fixity. Early modern fears would then begin to appear not as incidental lapses, defined a priori as marginal, but as credible statements of experience. They would finally be recognized as no less substantial than the phenomenon of fixity itself. The Nature ofthe Book tries to treat all sides of the world of print with equal historiographical respect. In so doing, it inherits and attempts to develop initiatives central to the current state of cultural history. In particular, it reflects the important French field of histoire du livre. This field, at first associated with the Annales movement, has since the 1950S developed into an academic industry in its own right. 46 At the same time, its approaches

have changed substantially. Its original practitioners dedicated themselves to accounting for the effects of printing in terms of quantitative measures of manufacture and distribution. They divided up the realm of print by subject matter and by the social character of purchasers, hoping to arrive at objective indices of cultural change. In fact, fewer useful figures emerged than had been hoped for. But the approach, so representative of Annales historiography, nonetheless had-and still has-substantial advantages. Above all, it suited commonsense perceptions of what it is that most properly characterizes print: the large-scale reproduction and distriburion of precisely the same objects. Eisenstein's representation of print culture effectively embodies those same perceptions, albeit without the quantification. However, as illustrated by the examples of Galileo and Tycho, there were also costs to such a strategy. One was that it was effectively "indifferent to the objects themselves." It assumed that successive editions of a work were essentially the same, whatever their variations in text, format, or appearance. It would have accounted the Venice edition of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius the same as the unauthorized Frankfurt impressionY Another, equally serious, disadvantage was that it remained silent about how the objects being counted were employed by readers such that they could have divergent cultural consequences. It could not have explained the different receptions accorded Galileo's Dialogo, because it ignored what Roger Chartier calls the "intellectual 'labor'" required to pur a book or paper to use. 48 Chartier himself has been central to efforts to address these costs. He has worked to recover the different modes of labor surrounding printed materials, revealing how readers in local settings could "appropriate" in different ways the books they read. From this perspective, ways of reading are recognized as "social and cultural practices." Like other such practices, they have a history, and one that can be reconstructed. The practical implications prove substantial. Sensitivity to the historical character of these practices often shows that an apparently authoritative text, however "fixed," could not compel uniformity in the cultures of its reception. In practice, rather the reverse seems to have happened. Local cultures created their own meanings with and for such objects. For example, during the Counter-Reformation, printed images issued in large numbers in an attempt to standardize religious practice instead frequently served as vehicles for continued differentiation. The elements of a printed book-its format, layout, and typographyacted as no more than elements in an instrument, the book itself, that was useful for constructing knowledge. They were the tools, among others, with

which users forged readings. In general, we may conclude that print entailed not one but many cultures, and that these cultures of the book were themselves local in character. 49 As the opening pages of this chapter implied, there was one concern in particular that possessed early modern readers, and that may be used as a key to the rest. Could a printed book be trusted to be what it claimed? Perhaps a reader would be prudent to reserve judgment. On the most obvious level, whether a Sidereus Nuncius printed in Frankfurt was really Galileo's text, or an Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica produced in N uremburg was really Tycho's, could justifiably be doubted. More broadly, the very apprehension that printed books might not be self-evidently creditable was enough to rule out any possibility of their bearing the power attributed to them by most modern historians. And that apprehension was widespread. Piracy and plagiarism occupied readers' minds just as prominently as fixity and enlightenment. Unauthorized translations, epitomes, imitations, and other varieties of "impropriety" were, they believed, routine hazards. Very few noteworthy publications seemed to escape altogether from such practices, and none at all could safely be regarded as immune a priori. It was regarded as extremely unusual for a book professing knowledge-from lowly almanacs to costly folios-to be published in the relatively unproblematic manner we now assume. Contemporaries had good reason to be wary. Their editions of Shakespeare, Donne, and Sir Thomas Browne were liable to be dubious. So were those of Robert Boyle, not to mention the first "scientific" journal, the Philosophical Transactions. Even Isaac Newton's Principia suffered from unauthorized reprinting. From Galileo and Tycho to Newton and John Flamsteed, no significant learned author seemed to escape the kinds of practices soon colloquially subsumed under the label of piracy. This meant that even when a book was not so treated, the possibility that it might be still permeated the negotiations, practices, and conventions by which it was made, distributed, exchanged, and used. If piracy was as widespread as commonly feared, then trusting any printed report without knowl49.

edge of those processes could be rash. Profound problems of credit thus attended printed materials of all kinds. Without solutions there could be few meaningful uses for books-and perhaps no durable reasoning from them. It should not be surprising, then, that contemporaries did not always identify fixity as a central characteristic of print. Surveying the books available to aid ocean navigators, Edmond Halley, for one, noted that "the first Editions have generally been the best; frequent Copying most commonly vitiating the Originals." 50 Even when people did refer to enhanced reliability, it was often in the face of direct evidence to the contrary. Textual corruption of even such closely monitored texts as the Bible actually increased with the advent of print, due to various combinations of piracy and careless printingY The first book reputed to have been printed without any errors appeared only in 1760. Before then, variety was the rule, even within single editions. Martin Luther's German translation of Scripture was actually beaten into print by its first piracy, and in succeeding years the proportion of unauthorized to authorized texts was roughly ninety to one; these inclu,ded Luther's own translation, newly ascribed to others (including Catholics), and others' work reattributed to him. A century later, the first folio of Shakespeare boasted some six hundred different typefaces, along with nonuniform spelling and punctuation, erratic divisions and arrangement, mispaging, and irregular proofing. No two copies were identical. It is impossible to decide even that anyone is "typical." 52 In such a world, questions of credit took the place of assumptions of fixity. In attending to this issue, The Nature of the Book builds on Steven Shapin's identification of trust as a key element in the making of knowledge. 53 Where Shapin concentrates particularly on intersubjective trust, asking fundamental questions about whom one should believe, why, and in what circumstances, The Nature ofthe Book identifies a similar issue in the trust accorded to printed materials. It asks how readers decided what to believe. A central element in the reading of a printed work was likely to be a critical appraisal of its identity and its credit. Readers were not without resources for such an assessment. When they approached a given book, with them came knowledge about the purposes, status, and reliability of printed materials in general-knowledge they used to determine the appropriate kind and degree of faith to vest in this unfamiliar object. Yet here too they also brought to bear knowledge about kinds of people. Their worries about

CHAPTER ONE

literary credit were often resolved, as a matter of everyday practice, into assessments of the people involved in the making, distribution, and reception of books. Readers worried about who decided what got into print, and about who controlled it once it was there. The twin problems of whom and what to credit were in practice often combined into one. When early modern readers determined a book not to be worthy of credit, they could do so on a number of grounds. It was in the attribution of "piracy," however, that the issues ofcredibility and print particularly converged. The term seems to have been coined by John Fell, bishop ofOxford, to describe the rapacious practices of London printers and booksellers. It had a technical meaning: a pirate was someone who indulged in the unauthorized reprinting of a title recognized to belong to someone else by the formal conventions of the printing and bookselling community. But it soon came to stand for a wide range of perceived transgressions of civility emanating from print's practitioners. As such, almost any book could, in principle, find itself accounted a piracy, whatever its actual circumstances of production and distribution. Historians of printing have therefore misconstrued instances of alleged piracy in at least two senses. First, they have seen piracy, like fixity, as inherent in the object, and not as a contestable attribution. Second, furthermore, they have assumed cases of piracy to be exceptions, accidental (in the philosophical sense of the word) to the essentially stabilizing character of print. Contemporaries were not so sure of this. Incidents that have been retrospectively dismissed as isolated and exceptional often seemed to them commonplace and representative. They might even be seen as attempts to undermine, and thereby to reform, the whole structure of the book trade. Even when conducted in more humdrum circumstances, moreover, and with less ambitious ends in sight, piracy still had powerful implications. Its apparent prevalence affected the economic and cultural conditions of all printed and written communication. It conditioned the accreditation of printed materials of all sorts, from the humblest ABC to the most elaborate encyclopedia. 54
54. An inspiration for this treatment, as for other aspects of this book, has come from medieval hisrory. Medievalists have devoted much attention to activities of "forgery" and "plagiarism." They have constructed a sophisticated historiography addressing the diversity of acts since subsumed under such labels, immersing the subject in a detailed and authoritative treatment of the cultural uses of writing and reading in general. Medieval "forgery" is appropriately seen as a form of truth-creation, justified (and perhaps even determined) by contemporary ideas about the nature and purposes of writing. It was also extraordinarily common. Perhaps half the documents known from Merovingian times are by our lights fake, and two-thirds of the documents known to have been issued to ecclesiastics before BOO would now be reckoned forgeries. See Grafton, Forgers and Critics, 24-5, 30-32; Clanchy, From Memory to Written Record, n8-20, 231-57; Stock, Implications o/Literacy, 59-87; Constable, "Forgery and Plagiarism."

For the learned, and for natural philosophers in particular, this had peculiarly important consequences. In the agonistic field ofearly modern natural knowledge, allegations of piracy readily shaded into charges of plagiarism. Such allegations therefore extended to the reputation of authors. That is, unauthorized printing threatened to "unauthorize" authors themselves. Even more important, it threatened the credibility to be attributed to their ideas. Like print itself, piracy therefore had epistemic as well as economic implications: it affected the structure and content of knowledge. For an enterprise like experimental philosophy, in particular, which depended implicitly on the trust accorded to the printed reports issued by its protagonists, the consequences threatened to be nothing short of devastating. The Nature ofthe Book provides the first extensive taxonomy of practices labeled piratical-from piracy itself, through abridgment, epitomizing, and translation, to plagiarism and libel. It not only traces the people, places, and practices through which books came into existence and were circulated. It also shows how allegations of impropriety in general, and of piracy in particular, emerged from the practices of the printing house and bookshop. It thus explains how and why such allegations gained their apparent ubiquity. Moreover, it then proceeds to ask how these changes could possibly be comprehended in terms of the polite civility supposed to guide intellectual conduct, and how claims that such practices had been pursued affected the reception of the works concerned. In short, it addresses precisely the epistemic significance of piracy. Printers and booksellers were manufacturers of credit. They had to be. The skills of those producing and trading in books, and the perceptions of those using them in learned work, might not intersect harmoniously. Whether or not they did at the moment of publication, moreover, accounts of printers' and booksellers' actions might still be drawn upon later by critics and rivals to challenge the value of any particular book, for example by alleging piracy. When they did succeed in remaining in the background-a rarer achievement than we might suppose- it was likely to be the result of hard and continuing work carried out "behind the scenes." A principal aim of The Nature ofthe Book is to recover this work and display its importance. While it mentions many instances in which publishing enterprises failed to proceed smoothly, then, its intent is not just to attest to the frequency of such failure. It instead substantiates Marc Bloch's dictum that "a good cataclysm suits our business." The historian, Bloch pointed out, often depends on "calamities" for the preservation and revelation of information, and this
hensibilis." For these medievalists' perspectives on print-which deserve more attention than they have received-see Clanchy, "Looking Back," and Rouse and Rouse, Authentic Witnesses, 449-66.

is no exception. 55 Problems and disputes were often the occasion for the creation of records documenting practices that remained unrecorded in cases of more successful publication. This volume is accordingly concerned to use such testimony to display the commonplace and unremarkable quite as much as the disastrous and spectacular; and especially to use the latter to reveal the former. The indispensable agency of printers and booksellers might remain unnoticed, for example, since the credit of their products depended on its being so. They themselves developed sophisticated ways of ensuring that they stayed just sufficiently in the background to avoid suspicion of either subterfuge or authorship. But in disputes the character of a bookseller or printer mattered. For readers attuned to its significance, anonymity itself might then become a source of suspicion. 56 Historians can put the resulting allegations to use as evidence. They need no longer be complicit in the cabal by their own silence. The ways in which such agents thought of and represented themselves were therefore of central importance to the received credit ofprinted knowledge. The point is not a simple one. What it was for a printer or bookseller to act "properly" could be determined in any number of ways. The principles of such propriety were consequently liable to vary. Yet it is impossible to understand impropriety without at the same time comprehending these, the conventions of propriety that were allegedly being violated. The two came into being in tandem. Chapter 3 thus addresses the ways in which printers and booksellers themselves fought to create a trustworthy realm of printed knowledge by articulating such conventions. The civility they adopted was complex, but it was also highly consequential. On its central concept of "propriety" rested the authorship of every writer who aspired to profess knowledge in print. Its maxims, reconstructed below, were important not just because of their use in resolving individual cases of piracy or unlicensed printing, but because they became central to the trade's representation of itself as a respectable craft. How printing should properly be practiced, in what ways it should properly be regulated - in effect, what printing itself was-would all be defined by reference to them. The epistemic significance of piracy therefore extended, reflexively, to printing itself: the very nature of print remained unresolved throughout the early modern period, and piracy was central to its resolution. From the practical regime described in chapter 3 emerged print culture itself. Chapters 4 and 5 trace how this happened. Chapter 4 tells the story of John Streater, a printer with a remarkably sophisticated republican philoso55. Bloch, Historian's Craft, 74-5· 56.

phy. Streater's actions threatened to transform the nature ofprint and society simultaneously. His activities and interests ranged widely, from soldiering and arms dealing to natural magic and law reform. In particular, though, Streater tried to redefine the grounds of proper action for printers and booksellers by doing historical work of an extraordinarily ambitious sort. He rewrote the history of printing in an attempt to reconfigure its governing political culture and thereby redefine its current and future identity. The initiative was then inherited from Streater himself by others who pursued cognate goals through the eighteenth century. Chapter 5 examines their rivalries. It explains the new historical identities they forged for both print and its propriety. In fact, the use of historiographical work to create new identities and proprieties is an idee fixe of this book. It has become well known that scholarly figures attempted this kind of enterprise fairly frequently. So, however, did craftsmen and hacks. Joseph Moxon placed the press and the printer in a tradition of the mathematical sciences going back, through Tycho Brahe, to Vitruvius; chapter 2 describes his work. Streater and his ally, the embittered ex-Cavalier Richard Atkyns, told the history of printing as one of proto-industrial espionage. Sir Thomas Browne constructed a history of plagiarism, and Joseph Glanvill articulated a double-usurpation theory of ancient philosophy in order to criticize Aristotle and make room for the experimentalists of the Royal Society. These characters appear in chapter 7. Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed, the subject of chapter 8, went further still, and constructed three parallel histories: that of his own feud with Newton; that of Tycho's with Ursus (of which he thought the former was a recapitulation); and a full history ofastronomy from biblical times to the present, designed to culminate in its own appearance at the head of Flamsteed's great Historia Gelestis Britannica. Through these he tried to guide posterity to an understanding of his own proper identity. Each of these historiographical projects plays its part in the narrative that follows. I take such historical self-representation to be of central importance in constituting the identities agents felt themselves to possess, and hence in influencing their notions of proper action for their contemporaries too. The historiographical efforts recounted in chapter 5, in particular, led directly to the assumptions of reliability and credibility from which the print culture of the modern age arose. And the present work is of course no exception to this rule. The transformed history presented in The Nature ofthe Book is intended to encourage new thinking about the character of print in our own age. The sources of print culture are therefore to be sought in civility as much as in technology, and in historical labors as much as in immediate cause and effect. The "printing revolution," if there was one, consisted of changes in the conventions of handling and investing credit in textual materials, as

CHAPTER ONE

much as in transformations in their manufacture. The point deserves to be stressed explicitly. I do not question that print enabled the stabilization of texts, to some extent; although fixity was far rarer and harder to discern in early modern Europe than most modern historians assume. I do, however, question the character of the link between the two. Printed texts were not intrinsically trustworthy. When they were in fact trusted, it was only as a result of hard work. Fixity was in the eye of the beholder, and its recognition could not be maintained without continuing effort. At no point could it be counted on to reside irremissibly in the object itself, and it was always liable to contradiction. Those faced with using the press to create and sustain knowledge thus found themselves confronting a culture characterized by nothing so much as indeterminacy. If printing held no necessary bond to truth, neither did it show a necessary bond to falsity or corruption. Each link remained vulnerable to dispute. It is this epistemic indeterminacy that lends the history of the book its powerful impact on cultural history. Understanding how it could be overcome to make knowledge and hence cultural change is what the history of the book is for. There did exist strategies that could be adopted in order to secure as much credibility for printed objects as readers needed. Chapters 6 and 7 describe such strategies, as pursued by gentlemen and philosophers in a number of different settings. They argue that their pursuit was vital for the establishment of both new philosophies of nature and new practices of knowledge-making. A central tactic in most cases was that of attributing trust to a book on the basis of an evaluation of a person. Look closely at attributions of credit to printed materials, and, as already noted, there will generally be an attribution of credit to an individual involved. "It must be only by the Marks and Properties of an Imposture, that we can know an Imposture from that which is a real Truth, when attested unto us," counseled Humphrey Prideaux in a much-read analysis of the credibility of alleged scriptural writings. But in identifying such "marks" of imposture, attention should center on consideration of its maker and his conduct. If the producer seemed a wicked man, using "craft" and "fraud" to propagate a claim for his own interest, then that claim could justifiably be accounted a falsehood. 57 Prideaux's recommendation was conventional enough. Similar exhortations appeared in many works of his era. In action, these skills were therefore intriguingly recursive. Readers assigned credit to printed materials

on the grounds of knowledge about their makers, which was in turn assessed pardy in terms of printed sources already accredited. In such ways might knowledge become more secure. But this was only one of many possible strategies. From the printing house and bookshop, through the craft center of Stationers' Hall, to the learned sites of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, The Nature ofthe Book identifies the techniques developed in each location by which books could be appraised and accredited. The use of print for making knowledge depended on these local practices of printing, exchange, and reading. The bookshop and printing house were regularly identified as places of promise and achievement. But they were also centers of conflict, plotting, and betrayal, where the proprietor could exhibit a notable fluidity of social identity. In anachronistic terms, he or she-the book trades were remarkable for the participation of both men and womenmerged the roles of socialite, friend, ally, entrepreneur, and even spy. His or her responsibility for the contents of a book seemed almost infinitely negotiable: however tactically unwise, outbursts such as those by Grassi and Scheiner against the bookseller were not intrinsically unreasonable. Hence the merging of trust in people with trust in things. Concerns over the effect of printing were readily expressed in terms of such practitioners. Bookshops represented points ofattraction for potential Brunos and Patrizis, it was said, in part because those who ran them were so inclined. They were also frighteningly good at their work. To flirt with anachronism once more, besides being manufacturers ofcredit, seventeenth-century booksellers were the best sociologists of literature of their day. The autonomy and creativity of Continental scholar-printers in these respects are well known. Eisenstein conjured an image of what she called "print-shops" as "'polyglot' households"-nodal points for the transfer of people, writings, and knowledge. The European "print-shop," she suggested, was where the "scholar" and the "craftsman" really met. 58 In some respects, and under certain circumstances, the smaller printing house or bookshop of London, Paris, or Rome could become a similar social site. Indeed, the household unit typically found here was perhaps rather more appropriate for such sociability than the relatively large operation of an EIzevir or a Plantin. But it also had to operate under more evident regulatory constraints. Eisenstein's view was that printers and booksellers were "natural" enemies to outside regulation of any kind. In fact, this was far from the case. In cities like London and Paris, the vast majority supported licensing

and similar regimes. They had good reason to do so. Those systems were deemed necessary to guarantee trust, order, and propriety in their craft. 59 Livelihoods therefore depended on them. A new understanding of these measures is needed. It must acknowledge their use to suppress texts ofwhich the state disapproved-a use that was certainly real, but that included publications discreditable for reasons of piracy as well as ofsedition or obscenity. But it must also appreciate the obverse of this function: the central role contemporaries ascribed to such systems in the maintenance of any trust at all in the realm of print. Printers were "mechanicks," as much in need of "licensing" as preachers (especially "mechanick" preachers) and medical practitioners (the analogue here being "empiricks"). For similar reasons, the book trades themselves participated in their own regulation. Some went further still. They proposed ways to change the very nature of the printing enterprise and to transform the character of its practitioners.
59. Eisenstein, Printing Press, 442. It is also significant that early modern images of the press showed a greater diversity than recognized by Eisenstein. Eisenstein shows only the complimentary iconography of Prosper Marchand ("The press descending from the heavens"); we need also to remember the devils chasing each other through the printing house portrayed in Huss's La Grante Dame Macabre, and broadsheets mocking those who believed anything produced by the press. Something ofthis iconographic range is reproduced in chapter 5 below. For an example of the importance of Catholic censorship in astronomy, see Gingerich, "Censorship of Copernicus."

Hevelius's "Civic Stellaeburg" in Danzig (now Gdansk). Hevelius's city building housed every device needed for an astronomer, from telescopes and lens-making equipment to a printing house. He sought to guarantee the credibility of his printed representations by doing all the corresponding activities, from observing to engraving, himself. His success was mixed. Still he needed imperial privileges to forbid other printers' "frauds"; and astronomers like John Flamsteed felt able to cast doubt on his accounts of these processes. Hevelius, Machina Gelestis.

There were ambitious attempts to establish a non-"mechanical" printing house for learned work, for example. In England the most notable such effort was Archbishop William Laud's at Oxford. Inherited by John Fell at the Restoration, Laud's initiative was eventually secured as Oxford University Press. GO The appointment of quasi-genteel "patentees" was, as chapters 3 and 4 show, an even more ambitious strategy to change the very nature of printing so as to eliminate problems of discredit. Patentees were wealthy printers or booksellers-or even gentlemen from outside the trade altogether-to whom the crown granted exclusive rights to key titles, or indeed to whole classes of publication. One patentee held the right to all law books, for example; another held that to all bibles. It was reckoned that they and their books would be securely trustworthy by virtue of their gentility and their dependence on royal favor. In the eyes of some, they could become a model for a future realm of print guaranteed by a decreed civility. Perhaps an urban equivalent to Tycho's civil press-or at least, to Hevelius's at Stellaeburg-could be constructed (fig. 1.10).

Ward, Oxford University Statutes, I, 205-6, declaring that an architypographus must be appointed so that "sordid and vulgar arrizans may not pervert the indulgence of that most clement prince [Charles I] to their own private lucre ... experience has shown [that] these mechanical artizans ... pay the least possible attention to calligraphy, or the beauty or elegance of the work, but thrust into publication any works, however rude and incorrect."

CHAPTER ONE

To the early modern world, then, the character of the printing house and the civil order in which printed books could be accorded trust were interdependent. Bookshops too were places encouraging novel interactions, as indeed were institutions such as the Royal Society. Throughout this book close attention is therefore accorded to the details ofsuch locations. Readers will be led down the darkest alleys of London, and guided through homes and workplaces to reveal their characters with an intimacy few early modern gentlemen can have shared. But here, it may be thought, crouches a paradox. Does the importance of print not lie precisely in its ability to transcend such local contexts and enable communication across wide distances? Sutely such a close focus on individual locations risks obscuring this, the most consequential issue of all. It is a real question, with implications beyond the understanding of print alone. The next section addresses this apparent paradox, and from a correspondingly broad perspective. For a central theme of The Nature ofthe Book is to see this power to transcend place as something itself in need of explanation.

The Nature ofthe Book concentrates for the most part on one country, England, and in particular on its capital city, London. 61 The focus is by no means exclusive, and in fact discussion does extend across Europe as appropriate. Nevertheless, the question must arise: why? The choice may appear arbitrary. More to the point, it may seem perverse to address questions of the identity and consequences of print by examining anyone location, when the very essence of print, supposedly, is that it enables human beings to transcend their immediate circumstances and communicate reliably with others in different times and places. These are important questions. One plausible answer to the first derives from the extensive attention that historians have directed at the emergence of polite commerce in Augustan England. 62 As part of this, England became one of the earliest nations to de61. Strictly speaking, from the early eighteenth century Britain succeeded England as the political entity in question. Since my discussion covers a long period before union, and in any case concentrates on the region around London, I have generally referred to England here. The issue of national identity was a charged one, however, as has been brought to the fore in such recent studies as Colley, Britons; Russell, Fall of the British Monarchies; and Morrill, Nature ofthe English Revolution, 91-II7. 62. The most recent and comprehensive survey is the massive three-volume series formed by Brewer and Porter, Consumption and the World ofGoods; Bermingham and Brewer, Consumption ofCulture; and Brewer and Staves, Early Modern Conceptions ofProperty.

velop a sophisticated commercial culture of printing and publishing, and its concepts of authorship, liberty of the press, and intellectual property have been of influence across the world. It warrants attention for that reason alone. But a further justification may also be advanced-one that addresses the more fundamental question of why it is appropriate to focus on anyone location at all. This book concentrates on the implications of printing for knowledge, and for knowledge of nature in particular, for reasons already outlined. It does so at what was undeniably a time of extraordinary creativity in the history of science. Early modern England witnessed not only the invention of experimental philosophy and the advent of the Royal Society, but the achievements of such figures as Francis Bacon, William Harvey, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton. The Nature ofthe Book aspires to address some of our founding assumptions about how such successes were attained. To do so, it concurs with much current work in the history of science in relating knowledge to its particular social and cultural settings. The universality of science, such work suggests, is an achievement realized only through much hard work. That work is necessarily specific to its particular sites, be they medieval universities, Renaissance courts, or Victorian laboratories. 63 Such are the places that have harbored the kind ofskilled practices through which knowledge has been created and sustained. From this perspective, museums, laboratories, and royal palaces are seen as not just architectural structures, but distinct social spaces generating different practices fertile of new knowledge. 64 The knowledge fashioned in such places answers the needs of the moment, addresses the questions of the time, and satisfies the standards of the local culture. For the historian, print and science share a rather intimidating characteristic. Both appear to transcend place. Scientific knowledge, it has been asserted, is by its very nature true wherever one may find oneself. That is what constitutes its claim to objectivity.65 Print seems blessed by a similar

transcendence: in many historians' hands, it appears to hint at something floating apart from specific, compromised, adulterated actuality. Just as appreciations of science have too often eschewed attention to the detailed intricacy of knowledge in the making, so cultural historians' appreciation of print has too frequently stopped short at the doors of the printing house. 66 But if the universal character ofscience can be appraised as an achievement, warranted and maintained by situated labors, may the same not be true of print? The suggestion is at the core of this book's approach. Searching for print culture in the making, we actually zero in not just on London, but on particular streets, buildings, floors, and rooms. We shall try to recover the identities, representations, and practices of the people who lived and worked in those rooms. And we shall see how hard they worked to create the realm of print, in a complex and unforgiving web of such domains. The close attention paid by The Nature ofthe Book to the intricate details of individuals' practices, characters, and motivations, far from being peripheral, is thus essential. Such a focus must be adopted in order to show how print, like scientific truth, attains the level of universality-by the hard, continuous work of real people in real places. This makes the conjunction of the history of print with that of science especially intriguing. The juxtaposition becomes only more curious when one recalls the enormous-perhaps even defining-role that historians have almost unconsciously ascribed to print in the history of science. That history is routinely represented in terms of a chronological skeleton, the joints of which are dates such as 1543, 1632, 1687, 1789, 1859, and 1905.67 These years are etched in the memory of every historian of science with a permanence no others can match. They seem ineluctable. Novel historiographical approaches leave them unscathed. And all, of course, are publication dates, ranging from Copernicus's De Revolutionihus (and Vesalius's De Humani Corporis Fabrica) to Einstein's revolutionary paper introducing special relativity. To that extent, the history of print and that of science are tacitly acknowledged to coincide. Yet, strangely, recent historiography has implicitly directed attention away from the conjunction. The reason for this apparent paradox is subtle, and even rather profound. There is a sense in which the history of early modern science no longer exists. Historians now employ all the resources of cultural and social histo66. This could not be said of bibliographers, but then these have often been too modest in their historiographical objectives. Historians of the book such as Henri-Jean Martin are a more consequential exception, for which see above, pp. 28-30. 67.

riography in an attempt to explain why people made certain claims in certain circumstances, and why they were or were not believed; whether or not such claims are, to modern eyes, "scientific" has ceased to seem so important. Indeed, although the early modern world recognized something it called "science" (or, more likely, the Latin scientia)-namely, the kind of demonstrative knowledge produced by geometers or infallible logiciansit did not acknowledge anything like the modern enterprise. And it certainly did not harbor any scientists. 68 The consequences of accepting this prove substantial. The extent ofacceptable topics has widened enormously. Movements previously assumed peripheral-Jesuit philosophy, for example, or, perhaps most spectacularly, hermeticism- have been reassessed as powerful and authoritative in their particular settings. More canonical subjects have also been transformed. Experimental philosophy and Newtonianism, in particular, are no longer seen as gaining straightforward victories over selfevidently inferior opposition. On the contrary, they are seen as struggling for credibility in a cultural bazaar filled with more different candidates for natural knowledge than had ever existed before, offering greater potential rewards. Their proponents' strategies must accordingly be understood as developing in response to these formidable and effective opponents. As they did so, they themselves diverged; it is difficult now to identify anyone thing to call "Newtonianism." An appreciation of the viability of alternatives has thus had enriching implications for our understanding of the canonical successes of the "scientific revolution" toO. 69 But this appreciation of a far wider range of places and practices has also had its costs. If natural knowledge was such a localized thing, then the processes by which it came to be transferred from place to place become rather mysterious. Talk of diffusion or dissemination will not now pass muster. The evocation of an all-powerful central source from which influence spreads across an inert terrain is no longer tenable, because sites of reception previously supposed passive are now recognized to have been vital, dynamic, and appropriative. Notions of "popularization" become equally problematic, since they too generally posit audiences as passive receptacles of influence rather than positive agents of appropriation. 70 With respect to

CHAPTER ONE

knowledge based in experiments the problem is especially evident. The transfer of this particular species of practical, performative knowledge to different sites could never be straightforward, if only because the replication of the localized skills in which such knowledge was based proved riddled with difficulties. Early modern experimentalists knew this all too well; it has only recently been rediscovered by historians. But what was most flagrantly true for experimental knowledge was also true, if less obviously, for other claims to epistemic authority. Here lies another reason to focus on England. In London, the Royal Society (chartered in 1662) pioneered solutions to these intractable problems. In part it did so by aggressive intervention in the realm of print. A long-term consequence was a transformation in both print and natural knowledge. Indeed, one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of Restoration experimental philosophy was that it explicitly confronted this situation. Robert Boyle and his colleagues at the Society recognized it remarkably early, and advanced notably cogent solutions. One aspect of their responses is well known, and has been extensively analyzed oflate. For all its difficulty of achievement, experimental philosophers appealed to replicability as testament to the truth of the knowledge they professed. In one sense, that very difficulty was an asset: it helped make successful repetition in different cultutal settings a robust criterion of truth. The result was a claim about replication that has become central to the authority of modern science. But the character of the obstacle to replication also deserves note. As has become well known, successful repetition of an experiment elsewhere often required the transfer of more than just written or printed materials alone. Extensive social contact berween practitioners was needed in order to reproduce cultural skills and settings in a new site. A skilled practitioner might even have to travel in person between the two locations in order for the attempted replication to succeed-or, for that matter, for it definitively to fail. It thus seems that nobody in 1660s Europe built an air-pump successfully by relying solely on Boyle's textual description of the engine. Some, we know, tried; all, we think, failed.?l A key assertion of the sociology of knowledge has been that this is true not just in practice, but in something approaching principle. Experimental knowledge of the kind sought by Restoration natural philosophers must necessarily be founded in skills, the character and application of which can never be stipulated exhaustively by written rules. Replication requires the recreation of a performative and interpretative culture in which candidate attempts can be conducted. Building new air-pumps could indeed be done

from recipe-like textual instructions, but only if interpreted in a shared recipe-reading culture. That is one reason why such knowledge seems to be inescapably social: it depends on the face-to-face interactions that help constitute such a culture.nlt is also why some historians ofscience have directed their attention away from what they think of as "texts." These are not, they suppose, the prime building blocks of either society or knowledge. Yet there must be more to say about the importance for the construction of natural knowledge of the construction of print. Early modern natural philosophers did make and use a variety of written, printed, and engraved objects. They labored over books, periodicals, letters, "schemes," and any number of similar textual and pictorial materials. They expended very large amounts of time and money doing so-larger, as chapter 7 will show, even than those expended on experimental instruments like the air-pump. Even the most basic historicist sensibility is likely to rebel at the thought that all this activity was intrinsically futile. In fact, it is possible to argue that it was central to enterprises dedicated to making knowledge-even experimental ones. Several historians have already noted that experiments often did not, in fact, need to be replicated at all. Rhetoric helped.?3 Boyle and his interlocutors developed sophisticated and prolix ways of writing reports of their experimental trials. By stating explicitly every circumstance of the experimental scene, a report sufficiently crammed with detail could aspire to persuade distant readers that they had as good as been there themselves. In that event, they effectively became "virtual witnesses" to the experiment itself. Such virtual witnessing could thereby render the actual practice of replication largely otiose. The skills of an experimenter may indeed have demanded complex cultural modes of transfer and appropriation, then, in which texts were not omnipotent (fig. 1.11). But if "texts" were ineffective for transmitting manual skills, more tangible objects could be put to use to mediate the creation of consensus by means of recruiting readers. Books, periodicals, papers, letters, maps, graphs, and diagrams did move back and forth between sites, proving extremely useful tools for the making and maintenance of knowledge. Rhetoric, however persuasive, came into being and achieved its effects only when incarnated in such objects. Historians of science need

to begin considering in detail their processes of manufacture, distribution, and use,?4 Use in particular is important here. It raises rather a subtle issue, hinted at in general above bur now requiring explicit attention. Almost all historians put themselves in the place of early modern readers and assume that their own act of reading replicates that of their historical counterparts. But this substitution may not be entirely innocuous,?5 A rather different approach is suggested ifone identifies reading itselfas a skill, just as historically specific as the more obvious dexterity involved in experimentation. If reading has a history, then assuming that modern readers' responses to a printed page accurately reproduce those of seventeenth-century men and women becomes problematic. Attendance to the conventions constraining the appropriation of printed objects in particular historical settings seems much more pertinent. Agreement across cultural spaces arose out of the exercise of such reading skills. Rhetoric, however expert, depended on them. The ques74. There are exceptions.

tions addressed in The Nature ofthe Book are of a correspondingly specific order: of how an experimental paper was actually composed by this writer, made by these workmen, distributed by these merchants and diplomats, and discussed in these ways, by these people, here, in these circumstances, with these results. This very minuteness of focus enables it to trace a grand process: the elaboration of a print culture and a culture of natural knowledge in tandem,76 Chapter 6 pursues this specificity to its most intimate level. It examines how early modern people represented reading itself, in terms of their very minds and bodies.?? Directing attention to the human frame, it asks how readers sought to understand their experiences in terms of its "passions." The implications of their quest extended very widely indeed: from the fortunes of Protestantism to the transmutation of metals, and from the education of gentlemen to the development of women's authorship. It also impinged directly upon their responses to Creation. Investigating the "book of nature" was thus a profoundly reflexive process: early modern people arrived at natural knowledge through reading, a skill that they in turn understood in terms of the natural knowledge so gained,78 Recognition of the ineffable character of skill thus need not imply that print is a peripheral subject for the historian of science. On the contrary, in the future we shall need to marry the two. The history of reading suggests one way to do so. The salience of printed books and papers cannot now simply be exorcised by alleging the inability of texts to determine their readers' conclusions; that they were unable to force concurrence does not

Gingerich and Westman are among the few historians of Renaissance science to have consistently attended to the entire history of books, from writing to reading: e.g., Gingerich, "Copernicus's De Revolutionibus"; Gingerich, "Censorship of Copernicus"; Westman, "Proof, Poetics, and Patronage"; Westman, "Reception ofGalileo's Dialogue"; Gingerich and Westman, Wittich Connection. William Eamon, although his work centers on books, does not generally venture into such details: see especially his Science and the Secrets o/Nature, and also his "Books of Secrets"; "Arcana Disclosed"; "From the Secrets of Nature to Public Knowledge"; "Court, Academy and Printing House."

mean that such objects were not interpreted at all. The reading of a book is no less skillful, and no less local, than the conducting of an experiment.?9 To understand the transformation of science into an apparently universal culture, then, we need to create a history of the reading practices surrounding scientific books as detailed and intricate as the appreciation we already have of the experimental practices surrounding scientific instruments. The Nature ofthe Book marks the beginning of that enterprise.
NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IN ENGLAND: WISDOM IN THE CONCOURSE

Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: She ctieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof ... But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity ... For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. PROVERBS I: 20-32

Translating the experiences of Galileo and Tycho into the rather different situation of late Renaissance England is not a straightforward task. The courts of Elizabeth, James I, and Charles I never attained the culture of absolutism surrounding those of Rudolf or Cosimo- much though they may have tried-and there was no official court philosopher here. 80 Yet in some ways English natural philosophy disputes were modeled on such Continental forms. Books and manuscripts played just as central a role in English courtly life, and percipient historians have noted the extent to which those presented at court might be assumed to bear the patron's authorship.8l Nor did this courtly role end with the Civil War. As we shall see in chapter 8, as late as 1712 not one of the four hundred copies printed of John Flamsteed's

Historia Ca'lestis-the greatest work of observational astronomy then in existence-seems actually to have been sold, but volumes were distributed through diplomatic channels across Europe and as far as Muscovy. Flamsteed, like Tycho in Prague, held the title of royal astronomer, and chapter 8 will show the extent to which he modeled every aspect of his conduct on Tycho's. But the difference between English and imperial natural knowledge may be measured by his failure. Although his observatory on Greenwich Hill more than matched his predecessor's Uraniborg for the accuracy of its instruments, Flamsteed had no private printing house. For him, the consequences were to prove calamitous. In England, there was no noble Tycho Brahe able to boast his own autonomous printing operation. There was no way in which the production of learned books could be taken out of commercial hands. Philosophers could not hope to emulate Tycho's success-partial and compromised though even that success was-because they had to live and work in an environment of city and court in juxtaposition. They had to reconcile civility with commerce. They had to utter their wisdom in the streets of London, where its reception would be far from secure. The first thing to appreciate about the articulation and reception of natural knowledge in early modern England is its insecurity. The achievements of the Royal Society were consequently but one element in a continuing history of attempts to discipline print and render it a sound platform for building a godly nation. That history included the development of vital and lasting new concepts of authorship, publication, and reading. A series of proposals for the reform of knowledge and its circulation grappled with this situation. Most influential were the ambitious schemes put fOlWard by James I's lord chancellor, Sir Francis Bacon. Bacon's identification of a trinity of transforming inventions-compass, gunpowder, and press-is, of course, famous. It is often assumed from this proclamation that Bacon recommended the open printing and publication of knowledge to aid in its advancement. Yet this is a misapprehension. Bacon in fact represented the printing press as a prime example of how inventions should not be sought. He believed that there was "nothing in the art of printing which is not plain and obvious." Speaking to Queen Elizabeth through the personified figure of Natural Philosophy, he called the press "a gross invention," which had been not so much invented as "stumbled upon and lighted on by chaunce." 82 And he certainly did not recommend unrestricted publication of knowledge, urging rather its retention within a tiny community of

CHAPTER ONE

royal licentiates. Both opinions derived from his view of the purpose and organization of knowledge. Bacon aimed to make natural philosophy a sector of the state. Regarding himself primarily as a statesman and royal counselor, he wished to establish an administrative mechanism for generating natural knowledge that would best serve the advancement of the crown. The best natural philosopher, in this vision, would be the best state official. His greatest targets in proposing this scheme were thus what he called "voluntaries": individuals who claimed a right to profess knowledge independent of the state's bureaucracy.83 In order to eradicate such dangerous knowledgepeddlers, it would be necessary to "purge the floors of men's understandings," and to replace their independent notions with rigid, unified rules of operation. "The business," he decreed, "must be done as if by machinery." The press was the exception that proved this rather daunting rule. It was a device discovered by chance, and by disorganized artisans. Yet it had prospered, and the commonwealth had profited by its success. Or had it? True, there were many new books to be read; but this did not mean that they conveyed any more genuine knowledge. Bacon urged that his bureaucracy create new editions of classic authors, "with more correct impressions, more faithful translations, more profitable glosses, more diligent annotations," the implication being that the creations of the press were at present profoundly unsatisfactory. Besides, open printing encouraged dangerous ambitions. Bacon therefore insisted that his own proposals be known only to "some fit and selected minds," and that the knowledge produced by his state machinery be similarly guarded. In the New Atlantis, his grand vision ofa political state founded on natural knowledge, the personnel of Solomon's House were required to take an oath of secrecy. Only three selected individuals were allowed to be "Interpreters of Nature." The governors would authorize only approved conclusions to be made public on their periodic "circuits." And the deep knowledge on which their useful promulgations were based would never be revealed at all. 84 A problem of authorship thus coincided with that of knowledge. In Bacon's era, ambitious treatises of natural knowledge were being written by an unprecedented multiplicity ofwriters: not only royal counselors, but lawyers (like Bacon himself, and later Sir Matthew Hale), mathematical practitioners (like Robert Recorde, Sir Henry Billingsley, Robert Norman, and Thomas Digges), university scholars (like Nathaniel Carpenter and John Wallis), churchmen (like John Wilkins and Seth Ward), and physicians (like William Harvey, William Gilbert, and Robert Fludd). Soon women like Margaret Cavendish would be added to their number. What was their claim

to legitimacy in so acting? How were their arguments properly to be resolved? Ironically, all claimed to offer unity and an end to the discord inspired by the very proliferation of voluntaries in which they themselves participated. Even natural magicians, conventionally identified as the worst of voluntaries, tried to establish their credentials as bringers oforder by waxing indignant at the "cavilling, brabling" and seditious scholastics. 85 Whether expressed as ridicule or hostility, opposition to illegitimate authorship became a pervasive feature of English writing on the natural world. Bacon's was a forthright statement of one ideal for the determination of disputes in natural knowledge. It effectively envisaged an English social equivalent ofUraniborg. All practitioners must be licensed by court officers, resolution of arguments must be centralized and decisive, word of the debates must be restricted to the central legislators, and there must be no publication to the populace without central approval. Printing, dispersal, and reading of books were to be monitored by a privileged elite according to its civil conventions. For a Jacobean counselor it was a tempting prospect. And it would be repeated in various forms by successive systematizers later in the century. Gabriel Plattes's proposed state "Laboratory," for example, would admit only someone prepared to stay inside "till he be brought forth to go to the Church to be buried." Even this seemed mild compared to Macaria, where anyone dispersing unlicensed opinion would, quite simply, be executed. 86 ' But although Tychonic isolation was tempting, it was not achievable. Courtly aspirations notwithstanding, in England there would always be other printers, booksellers, writers, and readers at work. The fact was that book dispersal did not operate entirely through diplomatic and courtly channels. There was a national and international book trade, and before long even books directed at restricted audiences- including, as already observed, both Tycho's and Galileo's-participated in it. Courts were continuously being reminded of the unpredictability (and worse) that could result, and again England's was no exception. If the propriety of disputes was that of the court-or, for that matter, the university-then the very involvement of the book trade introduced an important new element. It was not necessarily disastrous; Galileo, after all, embraced this realm for a while with
85. For a particularly insistent example see Fludd, Mosaicall Philosophy. Fludd raised the denial of controversy into an ontological principle, insisting that all apparent contrariety in the natural world must be referred to the undivided action of God; the quarrels ofscholastics, he thought, corresponded to their idolatrous respect for natural oppositions such as antipathies. 86.

creativity and skill. But it was definitely threatening. Printing and bookselling were concentrated almost exclusively in the vast social morass of London, a city represented by most courtiers and scholars as incipiently rebellious and fascinatingly venal. As would-be authors complained, Wisdom might find as heedless an audience in these streets as in those of Old Testament timesY Philosophers would be forced to see the problem with particularly stark clarity. We cannot say how Galileo would have fared had he been an Englishman. The nearest equivalent to his struggles in Rome and Florence, however, was a controversy over Copernicanism and related issues that occurred in 1634 - 46 between Alexander Ross and John Wilkins. Wilkins indeed took the Sidereus Nuncius as his model, reproducing one of its images of the Moon. 88 But the differences between the two cases are as revealing as the similarities. There was scant trace in this dispute ofTycho's sterilized way of printing and distributing texts, and of Galileo's recourse to court convenand was displayed in the shop tions. Wilkins's initial tract was of the most incendiary Puritan bookseller in London, Michael Sparke, who had earlier introduced Tycho himself to the London public in the guise of a Protestant millenarian prophet (fig. 1.12).89 Sparke's was the most prominent name on the title page. His notoriety, like that of Galileo's bookseller in Rome, fueled the conflict. Ross did attempt to use the issue for preferment in the church, but with minimal success. He ended up a bookseller's hack, churning out pedantic diatribes against every original thinker of the time. Neither writer managed to gain an audience at court, if that was their aim. In a sense, neither achieved authorship at all. The aspiration to authorship, however, stood at the center ofthe WilkinsRoss dispute, just as it had of Bacon's concerns. It was expressed as a mutual repudiation of the illegitimate "singularity" displayed by those who boasted, not reasoned knowledge, but passionate "fancy." Reconciling aspiration with credit was clearly difficult. To assert originality while avoiding the taint of singularity became a central problem for writers in all fields.

Some simply listened to the advice of their peers, and kept silent. Others relied on a flourishing and successful manuscript distribution system to evade the charge. 9o Still others, like Wilkins himself, chose to insist upon a "Philosophical Liberty" to suggest (but not to insist upon) ideas at variance with those espoused by received authorities. Geographer Nathaniel Carpenter actually funded his own printing and publication. 91 Wilkins took a further step, and ingeniously appropriated the conventions of modesty to avoid the charge of singularity. A writer must display hesitancy and probability, not a stentorian insistence on the certainty of his ideas, in order to reconcile credit with authorship. Doing so, one could avoid the trap of "boldness" into which singular authors invariably fell. Modesty could hold the commonweal together. Wilkins thus argued that Ross's "singularity" encapsulated at once his "conceit" for his own ideas, his "servile and superstitious" attitude to authority, and his slavery to "sense" rather than "discourse and

reason." Wilkins's opponent was the archetypal "captious" man. 92 In contrast, Wilkins himself had begun to articulate principles of authorship that historians of science will recognize as characteristic of early experimental philosophy. Wilkins's espousal of modesty and a liberty of philosophizing immediately reminds the modern reader of Boyle. But a significant difference exists. Wilkins's argument extended to questions normally the preserve of the mathematical sciences, not just natural philosophy and natural history. This division-between disciplines devoted to the mathematical representation of phenomena and those characterized by their collection and philosophical investigation-was ancient and persevering. Wilkins was one of several important figures to advocate a novel realignment. But such a transformation was as yet far from complete. One should therefore recall that the specific program of experimental philosophy proposed by Boyle was far from the only candidate for natural knowledge on offer. Even within the Royal Society itself, there were noteworthy alternatives, including various plans for natural and artificial histories, and indeed the "Physico-MathematicallExperimentall Learning" recommended by Wilkins himself. Isaac Newton was one contributor who pointed up the differences between Wilkins's and Boyle's conventions. 93 All, however, from mathematicians to alchemists and from experimentalists to physico-mathematicians, found themselves facing the problems of authorship and reception cast up by contemporary printing. The Royal Society helped all to address those problems, and it did so partly under the aegis of Boylean principles. It is in this context, then, and not just in that of Boylean experimental philosophy itself, that the Society's experiences of print proved consequential. It is not just that the virtuosi-as the Society's fellows were widely known - pioneered ways of dealing with print; those ways became central to the fortunes of natural knowledge of diverse traditions. The Society's own success has always been signaled by its publishing enterprises-which included the first "scientific" periodical, the Philosophical Transactions, and Isaac Newton's masterpiece, the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. But an account of the role of the book and other printed materials in the Society should end with these, not begin with them. One must first reconstruct the efforts to enact conventions of reading within

the Society itself, by which incoming books and papers could be handled and, perhaps, published in conditions of civil trust. In its interactions with the book trade, too, the Society worked hard to establish mastery, so that its productions would not be reprinted, translated, or even pirated without its consent. The maintenance of faith in its reports-and therefore in important natural and technical conclusions-depended on its success. Without these conventions it could not have built up and maintained renown as a location in which personal authorship would be safe. Indeed, upon them rested the very possibility of reconciling personal probity with the aspiration to philosophical authorship. Without them even a respected virtuoso might fall victim to a printer's conduct. "All l' Stationers" had to be "reduced to better Termes of Reason & honesty," warned John Beale, an active fellow of the Society. But the Society had to start with its own Printer, who generated "1' loudest outcrye" of all. "I wish he had subscrib'd his own name, & not mine," Beale complained after seeing the printed version of one of his papers, for readers would otherwise ascribe its "Phantastical, Imprudent, or Distracted" character to the authorship of Beale himself. "Wee should have more prudence, than to expose our reputations to the humour of such a sordid man." 94 Surely, it may be objected, printing may have affected the communication of knowledge, but scarcely its creation. Chapters 6 and 7 challenge this assumption by looking in close detail at the practices of knowledge-making in the Royal Society, and at the notions of reading and representation that underlay them. Chapter 7 in particular addresses the forrunes of natural philosophy. Chapter 8 then extends the scope of this analysis. It proceeds to examine one of the major mathematical sciences, namely astronomy. It demonstrates that not even apparently "raw" empirical observations and rigorously quantitative calculations could escape the implications. To do so it traces in detail the course of an astronomical dispute of central importance to the history of science. From 1675 Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed worked to construct a catalogue of the positions of the fixed stars. It promised to be the greatest work of observational astronomy ever produced. But by the end of 1712 Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, and John Arbuthnot had printed and dispersed a text of his work, against Flamsteed's vehement opposition. The unauthorized volumes presented a radically different view of the role of the astronomer from his own-one implying that he had been sorely deficient as a public servant. Even its apparently objective positional figures had been changed in the course of Halley's extensive "correction" of the press. The

chapter shows in detail how booksellers, printers, and natural philosophers combined in alliance to achieve their aims. If they failed, even elementary statements of observation would prove vulnerable. Together chapters 7 and 8 therefore demonstrate the centrality of the issues raised by earlier sections of the book for both philosophical and mathematical approaches to Creation. One reason Flamsteed suffered was that his observatory stood on Greenwich Hill, several miles distant from the clamor and grime of London. The character of the metropolis itself represents a final reason to focus on England. The unprecedented expansion of London created a unique urban environment with powerful and assertive craft communities. Here, as the Restoration virtuosi always stressed, the creation of natural knowledge must be a collaborative enterprise. It must draw together not just gentlemen, but printers and booksellers too-not to mention the critical readership thronging the coffeehouses. The labor would be long, and it would be hazardous to the good names of all involved. Philosophical writers would have to negotiate all the obstacles facing every other kind of would-be author, including regulatory regimes, piracy, skeptical booksellers, and unruly readers. Printers and booksellers, for their part, would suffer frustration, ridicule, debt, prison, and death. The story of natural knowledge in this period should embrace all their efforts. This book thus proceeds in a trajectory from the printing house and bookshop to the Royal Society and the Royal Observatory: from Joseph Moxon and Francis Kirkman to Isaac Newton and John Flamsteed. It is a valuable realignment. Emphatically, intellectual history cannot be just the history of intellectuals. 95 Scientific debate as such was unknown in the early modern world. We would be unjustified in artificially selecting what seems to us the "scientific" content of disputes such as that between Newton and Flamsteed in order to explain the successes of some theories, artifacts, and individuals over others. It is scarcely a novel proposition. A vast amount of work has been done to reveal the historical and cultural specificity of such strategies. What is more original is the suggestion that we need to appreciate just how important conventions of propriety in books' manufacture, dispersal, and use really were in the practice of natural philosophy. Adding this appreciation may result not just in an extension ofour knowledge, but in a change to the very essence of our historical perceptions. Early modern London, where the cultural construction of print coincided with the fashioning of experimental philosophy, offers unusually intriguing possibilities for such an approach. So intriguing, perhaps, that it is possible to suggest a still greater implication.

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF READING

Print and the Passions

I read in a book that rhe objectivity of thought can be expressed using the verb "to think" in the impersonal third person: saying not "I think" but "it thinks" as we say "it rains." There is thought in the universethis is the constant from which we must set out evety time.... And for the verb "to read"? Will we be able to say, "Today it reads" as we say "Today it rains"? If you think about it, reading is a necessarily individual act, far more than writing. If we assume that writing manages
to

go beyond the limitations of the author, it will continue to have a

meaning only when it is read by a single person and passes through his mental circuits. Only the ability to be read by a given individual proves that what is written shares in the power of writing, a power based on something that goes beyond the individual. The universe will express itself as long as somebody will be able to say, "I read, therefore it writes."

hile he was still at school, the natural philosopher Robert Boyle later recalled, he had once contracted a tertian ague. All physic failed. Reduced to a melancholic state, the young Boyle returned from London to Eton in the hope that the change of air and diet might help ease his condition. But his mentors also had other remedies in mind. To "divert his Melancholy," they made their charge "read the stale Adventures [of] Arnadis de Gaule; & other Rayiflg B06!{eS Fabulous & wandring Storys." Their treatment was by no means a success. Far from curing Boyle, he later testified, the stories "prejudic'd him by unsettling his Thoughts." They thereby exacerbated his complaint, and produced an effect more lasting than any remedy might have been. Meeting in him with "a restlesse Fancy, then made more susceptible of any Impressions by an unemploy'd Pensivenesse," his

reading "accustom'd his Thoughts to such a Habitude of Raving, that he has scarce ever been their quiet Master since." 1 Boyle's advisers should have read their Burton. The Anatomy ofMelancholy had endorsed the reading of learned books, not that of romances, to counter melancholy. But then, even such a well-attested remedy was prone to be counterproductive. The unhappy patient might all too easily "make a Skeleton of himselfe," Burton attested, eventually coming to resemble those "inamoratoes" who read nothing but "play-bookes, Idle Poems, Jests"and, to be specific, Amadis de Gaule itself. Far from being cured, Boyle risked ending up "as mad as Don QUixot."2 Luckily for him, in the end no such traumatic outcome came to pass. As Boyle later acknowledged, after much effort he did largely manage to "fixe his Volatile Fancy." He achieved this by subjecting himself to a rigorous intellectual regime. In particular, he found that mathematics provided the best tool "to fetter (or at least, to curbe) the roving wildness of his wandring Thoughts." The most effective way to restrain his meandering mind was to concentrate on the "more laborious Operations of Algebra." These, he found, "both accustome & necessitate the Mind to attention, by so entirely exacting the whole Man; that the least Distraction, or heedlessnesse, constraines us to renew our (Taske &) Trouble, & rebegin the Operation." They thus disciplined the mind out of the lax habits formed by romances. Nevertheless, the harmful effects of his earlier experience could never be eradicated entirely. Years later Boyle would still find himself leaving his manor at Stalbridge to wander alone in the fields, there to "thinke at Random; making his delighted Imagination the busy Scene, where some Romance or other was dayly acted." This odd behavior was regularly imputed to his melancholic complexion; but Boyle himself knew better. It was in reality nothing but "his yet untam'd Habitude of Raving; a custome (as his owne Experience often & sadly taught him) much more easily contracted, then Depos'd." 3 The effects of reading those romances had proved permanent, and Boyle simply had to live with them.

But Boyle also expressed positive views on romances: Principe, "Virtuous Romance and Romantic Virtuoso."

CHAPTER SIX

Reading was clearly a powerful force. True, it could be a positive one. What originally made Boyle so "passionate a Friend to Reading," he was wont to say, "was the accidentall Perusall of Quintus Curtius." This ancient romance of Alexander the Great had "conjur'd up in [him] that unsatisfy'd Curiosity of Knowledge, that is yet as greedy, as when it first was rays'd." Here was a benefit to outweigh his "raving." In Geneva on the grand tour, moreover, Boyle would continue to pursue "above all the Reading of Romances," and would become fluent in French from doing SO.4 But it was equally evident that if one wished to retain reliability and independence of mind, then one must be careful what, and how, one read. Back in Oxford in the 1650s, then, at the time when he, Wren, Wilkins, and others were pursuing the discussions of experimental philosophy that would eventually lead to the creation of the Royal Society, Boyle applied this hard-earned knowledge well. This was the time when "the Cartesian philosophy began to make a noise in the world," and he could hardly avoid hearing about it. But he resolved to "acquiesce in no single man's hypothesis." Accordingly, by a publicly declared self-denying ordinance (and in defiance of the strict rules for reading his work that Descartes himself had tried to impose), "for many years he would not read over Des Cartes's Principles." Boyle had even refused to read Bacon's Novum Organum, he claimed, "that I might not be prepossessed with any theory or principles." 5 True or not, to the historian these declarations are remarkable. A typical account of the intellectual history of Boyle's period would make Descartes and Bacon the most influential of all the disciples of "the new philosophy," yet here one sees the "acknowledged leader" 6 of experimentalism denying having read either. At the same time, Boyle claimed that the reading of romances had had a permanent unhealthy effect on him. Clearly, he must have thought that reading exercised a remarkable power over body and mind alike. And Boyle was by no means unusual in his appreciation of the power of reading. Many of his contemporaries testified to similarly impressive

encounters with books at an early age. The natural historian Francis Willughby, like Boyle, was thought to have weakened his body during childhood by too much reading. Again like Boyle, he fought to become a model gentleman by struggling to regulate his "motions and desires," but never fully recovered. Still more disquieting was the experience of Abraham Cowley, who found that reading Spenser in his mother's parlor "made [him] a Poet as immediately as a Child is made an Eunuch." Even Queen Mary was thought to have been permanently damaged by her childhood reading. Such experiences extended into adulthood too. Laudian scholar Peter Heylyn was one victim, his excessive reading engendering blindness as the "Laboratory" of his brain overheated and destroyed the crystalline humor of his eyes. Henry More advised Anne Conway not to read Descartes "with too much curiosity and solicitude," since it might exacerbate her persistent headaches. Rather later, the crypto-Jacobite virtuoso John Byrom used laudanum to treat his sister, Ellen, after noting that she had been "disturbed" by reading Clarendon. The treatment proved unsuccessful, and Ellen died. Many other examples could be cited, extending from the sixteenth through to the eighteenth centuries-and quite possibly beyond. From Boyle to Byrom, these diverse experiences were widely credited. They transcended place, time, sex, and social rank.? The message was as clear as it was disturbing. As much as it could facilitate learning and the communication of knowledge, reading had the power to determine one's future fate. It could blind, derange, and even kill. Yet there were countermeasures. As much as Boyle's distemper was widely recognized, so too was his successful treatment well warranted. Francis Bacon himself had said that there was no "impediment in the wit" that could not be "wrought out by fit studies: like as diseases of the body may have appropriate exercises." "So if a man's wit be wandering," he had advised, "let him study the mathematics." 8 Such advice was commonly available in the seventeenth century, and there is no reason to suppose that it was not just as commonly followed. Boyle knew what he was talking about. Both his condition and its cure were widely accredited. Similar concerns affected both the concept and practice of reading for many men and women of his

age, first during their upbringing and later in mature life. The historian would therefore be unwise to disregard his testimony too hastily as simply na'ive or erroneous. Such testimony was put to use in his own time, and it can now be put to use again. This chapter does so. It examines the grounds and consequences of experiences like Boyle's. It argues that the powerful effects of reading to which he fell victim were not only widely attested, but supported by contemporary knowledge about human beings and the physical world they inhabited. In consequence, accounts of the practical experience of reading came to playa central role in arguments about the status ofclaims to knowledge, especially when such claims came to be controverted. In a Protestant nation, defining itself substantially through the collective and individual experiences of reading Scripture, such a conclusion was of particular importance. As this chapter shows, argument centering on professed religious knowledge became a peculiarly intense site for discussions of the nature, role, and consequences of reading. This was one reason why the representation of reading was of profound concern to pedagogic writers, who addressed the problems involved in creating good Protestant subjects-and therefore devoted considerable effort to explaining experiences like those of the young Boyle. It also helps to explain why concepts of reading became essential to the conventions adopted by the newest claimant to knowledge, the experimental philosophy. Reading is a deceptively simple practice. It can seem so obvious and selfevident an activity that the idea of its having a history appears bizarre. But it is becoming increasingly clear that people in the past and ofother cultures do not read in anything that might unproblematically be called the same way as us. Reading shares this characteristic with other, more manual skills the historical dimensions of which have also recently been identified. 9 The historicizing of reading has particularly important implications, however, for the simple reason that it is through reading that documents of all kinds are put to use and thereby produce historical effects. The history of reading is devoted to exploring this theme. It is now a flourishing field. 10 A wealth of work exists showing that if reading is considered as a practice that, like such other practices, changes across time and space, then useful insights may follow about the character of personal, political, and social knowledge. This chapter argues that the same holds true for natural knowledge. 11

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF READING

The experience of reading is extremely difficult to describe in words. If Collins's and Polanyi's arguments about the ineffable character of skill are correct, then capturing it may even be impossible.1 2 The place of a reading practice, and its consequences as expressed in subsequent writings, are often traceable, being preserved in textual, pictorial, and material archives; but the immediacy of reading itself is not. Nevertheless, we may still hope to arrive at a useful understanding of how particular appropriations of books could come to be articulated in particular circumstances (and why others could not), why they had an impact, and why that impact was as it was. 13 The conventions adopted in the Stationers' court, which were investigated in chapter 3, and those developed at the Royal Society, which are the subject of chapter 7, are examples. Both could be assessed in terms of conventions of reading pursued in particular social spaces. The history of reading aims to trace and account for such dynamic processes, by appreciating the different practices by which readers in various times and places attribute meanings to the objects of their reading. It explains the global by rigorous attention to the local. One approach to the subject lies through what Roger Chartier calls "object studies." This involves tracing the different appropriations accorded a single book as it traverses a number of distinct social spaces. Such studies combine attention to the book itself, with its format, layout, and typography-the cluster ofcharacteristics connoted by the term mise en page-with research into the diverse conventions of reading in operation in its places of use. 14 An alternative is to concentrate not on one object, but on one reader. The opportunity to do this arises when such a reader has left traces of his or her reading, generally in the form of annotations on, or about, a set of books. The most impressive claims for the history of reading in Anglophonic historiography have probably been those based on the study of such annotations. 15 These traces are not necessarily rare. In the seventeenth century, especially, printed sheets bought at a bookshop would often be

regarded not as complete, but as remaining to be individualized by readers' additions. 16 The study of the resulting hybrids, half printed book and half unique manuscript, shows convincingly that "scholarly" reading, at least, was, as Grafton and Jardine put it, a "goal-orientated" enterprise. It aimed at immediate, active purposes, the "interpretation" of a given work varying according to what those purposes were. The efforts ofseveral historians have provided us with an incipient taxonomy of annotation strategies that may eventually revolutionize our understanding of how such interpretations were constructed. This chapter employs an approach rather different from these, but at the same time one complementary to both object studies and the analysis of annotations. It begins from experiences like Boyle's. In describing such powerful effects, Boyle's cautionary statements directed attention to what he thought actually occurred at the decisive moment of face-to-face confrontation between reader and read. Historians have remained remarkably reticent about this moment of confrontation, perhaps because it seems to embody so self-evident, so natural an act that there appears little they could usefully say about it. Even historians of reading have largely left it alone. Yet it ought to be central to an account of the history of reading, ifonly because, as a matter of fact, descriptions of it have varied widely in different periods. What is it that passes from page to mind when someone reads, and how does it have an effect? This is the fundamental question with which the analysis presented here begins. It is properly answered, however, not in out own terms, but in those of early modern England. 17 The following account does not propose that all individuals theorized the act of reading in the same way-nor even that most theorized it at all. But it does identify the most important anatomical, physiological, philosophical, and moral resources available to them when they did need to understand it. And it shows that when they wished to propose radical new kinds of knowledge, the need to deploy those resources could become extremely urgent. The most important resources available to early modern readers for describing their experiences derived from what contemporaries called the passions. Human beings perceived letters on a page through the mediation of their bodies; the passions were the emotional, physiological, and moral responses of the human body to its surroundings, and thus played an unavoidable part in the reading process. This chapter provides an account of these composite entities. They were discussed and analyzed by all branches of society, providing an extensive array of knowledge usable in understanding one's own and one's neighbors' conduct. The chapter argues that accounts

of reading generated with the aid of such knowledge became central to the attempted discrimination of true insight from dangerous error. Individuals who failed to control their passionate reading practices, and thereby fell prey to them, could then be diagnosed by a series ofsymptoms that were likewise understood in terms of the passions. And remedies could be proposed for them, disciplining the passions into conformity. By recovering this extensive and influential repertoire, the chapter provides a fresh perspective on the most personal aspects of reading. It also helps to bring the histories of reading and knowledge together.
SEEING PHYSIOLOGY

There is a fundamental problem with which to start. In early modern England, what was it to "see"? When one exercised vision, what actually passed through the air and into the eye, and how did it have an effect when it got there? Patrick Collinson has suggested that this question is really "where an account of protestant culture ought to begin." What follows will largely confirm his suggestion. IS Once this problem has been addressed, we shall then be able to move on to the more specific question of how one saw letters on a page. These two issues are the subject of this section. As an initial strategy, one can try interpreting Boyle's words at face value. "Prejudice," "fancy," "impressions," "habitude," "thoughts"-to an informed early modern reader these were readily recognizable terms. They were in regular use both in lay contexts and, more formally, in a variety of sciences relating to the mechanisms of perception and the workings of the mind. They should perhaps be read literally, then, to refer to processes of the mind and body. Knowledge of such processes was widely available in early modern England. It was staple to any number of discourses, ranging from everyday medicine, through casuistry and the moral advice of ministers, to highly specialized anatomical practice. Contemporaries felt able to use such resources to describe their experiences of perception and reasoning, including those involved in reading, and invested enough faith in them to act on those descriptions. The following discussion attempts to recover their knowledge and its uses. Discussions of vision began with the eye. They typically represented it as the natural equivalent ofa camera obscura (fig. 6.1).19 This was a well-known

device, familiar to a vast range of readers from Giambattista della Porta's Natural Magick and countless books of secrets. It could be made easily and bought cheaply. By 1655, Meric Casaubon could assume that most people "that have any curiosity" would have seen one, and the apparatus remained popular throughout the succeeding century, not least as an aid for drawing. 20 A camera obscura consisted of a darkened chamber of any size, ranging from a small box to a room large enough to contain a human being, with a pinhole in one wall. Light admitted through this hole formed an inverted image of the scene outside on the opposite surface. 21 In the eye, correspondingly, an image was thought to be "imprinted" or "painted" (both words were used) on the retina. The process could be reconstructed using specimen eyes from cadavers or, human bodies being scarce commodities, from animals (fig. 6.2). William Briggs used sheep's eyes to demonstrate his own theory before the Royal Society. Based on such studies, artificial eyes could be constructed on the camera obscura model, Wren suggesting that one would represent a suitable gift for Charles II should he ever deign to visit the Society.22 Such gadgets served to demonstrate the casting of an inverted image onto the retinal surface. From thence, it was assumed, "spirits" channeled in the optic nerves transmitted this image instantly to the brain. There it was again "impressed" onto something called the sensus communis, and thus perceived by the mind. 23 In what was by the Restoration probably the most influential general treatment of the subject, Rene Descartes famously placed this sensus communis at the pineal gland. Whether or not this was accepted, contemporaries universally believed that the sensus communis was imprinted at the same instant as the retina and in a manner mediated by the structure of the human body. 24 Such a camera obscura model provided a convincing account of correct perception. But impressions incident upon the sensus communis need not come from the eyes. They could equally have originated from any of the senses of smell, taste, hearing, or touch. Or, more interestingly, they might not have derived from outside the body at all. For images produced by the imagination were apprehended by the same process of imprinting as those generated by the senses from exterior phenomena. Whenever the mind

FIG. 6+ Isaac Newton's description of experimenting on his own eye. This was one of an intermittent series of trials that Newton undertook privately over a period of at least a year in the mid-166os. He had already concluded that his "fantasie" could excite the spirits in his optic nerve sufficiently to generate apparent images; now he "tooke a bodkin & put it betwixt my eye & y< bone as neare to y< backside of my eye as I could." Pressing the surface of his eye with this bodkin, he found that he could generate "white darke & coloured circles." Together the experiments illuminated the reliance of vision on physical and imaginative capacities. CUL Ms. Add. 3975, p. 15. (By permission of the Syndics of Cambridge University Library.)

either imagined or perceived an object, then, it was really considering an image traced on the surface of the sensus communis-and it could not always be sure which it was doing. Descartes himself therefore insisted that the term idea must be applied rigorously to any such "impressions," whether imaginative or perceptive in origin. Ideas of either source then acted as the spur to physical actions, the impulses inducing such actions being transmitted through the body by the same nervous system that mediated perception (fig. 6.3).25 This intimate and continuous interaction of body, imagination, and perception had at least one important consequence. It meant that camera obscura models of vision could never be as straightforward as their proponents had perhaps hoped. Far from having been rendered regular, and even mechanical, vision remained liable to corruption and counterfeiting, either by the imagination or by physiological conditions. Qualifications to camera obscura models accordingly became as routine as the models themselves. In

fact, even Della Porta had noted the problem. Describing the camera obscura, he had remarked that observers had to be conditioned in order for it to function properly, because of the role of "affection" in conditioning perception. 26 Descartes, too, observed that his anatomical demonstration of the eye as a camera worked only as long as it kept its "natural" shape-"for if you squeeze it just a little more or less than you ought, the picture becomes less distinct." 27 Just what constituted proper squeezing he left unclear. And Isaac Newton endorsed such qualifications in his Opticks, which came to be recognized as the most authoritative of all discussions. Newton warned that vision could be corrupted if the eye were either colored, too "plump," or not plump enough. Only in the proper circumstances, and only if the perceived phenomena were not "produced or altered by the power of imagination," could knowledge of colors be considered a Newtonian science. This he had actually verified on himself, managing solely through the exercise of his "fantasie" to create an illusory perception of the Sun in his rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge (fig. 6.4).28 The structure of the brain and nervous system thus played an essential part in the reception, manipulation, and effects of ideas. Even with a camera obscura model of the eye, this part could not be gainsaid, since it was built into the human frame. On the contrary, it must be confronted and understood. Although mechanical philosophers might call in principle for explanations to be couched in reductionist terms, in practice this further understanding had to be physiological (and, as we shall see, even moral) in character. To account for the construction of knowledge from perceptions, one needed an appreciation of the "affections" attendant upon the human constitution. The most significant contemporary account of this subject was to be found in the work of Oxford's Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy, Thomas Willis. In the early 1660s Willis undertook a series of detailed dissections of the brain and nervous system, accompanied by Richard Lower, who probably did much of the more grisly work, and by Christopher Wren, who drew the results. 29 Theirs was an epic enterprise. "Hecatombs" of cadavers were dissected- not only humans, but horses, sheep, calves, goats, hogs, dogs, cats, foxes, hares, geese, turkeys, fish, and even a monkey. In

London, Robert Boyle was kept informed of their labors, Walter Charleton repeated them, and Henry Oldenburg spread news of their findings across Europe. 3o Together these men created the most importanr work on neurology to be produced before the nineteenth century. And technical though it was, it proved extraordinarily influential in a range of contexts. Aspiring gentlemen were even exhorted to study it as a central part of their education. It was thereby also to prove of prime importance to representations of reading,31 It is important to convey some impression of the motivations driving Willis's enterprise, since that enterprise was a specific and unusual one. Willis was a convinced Church of England man, to the extent of having orchestrated clandestine Common Prayer services during the Interregnum. His project reflected this. Its printed representation, dedicated to his patron, the archbishop of Canterbury, revealed that Willis was not engaged in routinely didactic morbid anatomy. His true subject was what he called "Psycheology," or the "Discourse of the Soul." Willis began from a widely shared belief that the soul was divisible into two parts: a rational component, which was immaterial, immortal, and intellectual, and a sensitive one, which was corporeal and mortal. The former could not be subjected to physiological study, but the latter could, and on this he focused. This "sensitive soul" conducted all the physical processes of perception and movement, acting through the vehicle of "animal spirits" sublimed from the blood and channeled through the nervous system. These were the same spirits as those that transmitted perceptions to the sensus communis. They were like internal, corporeal "Rays of Light," Willis declared: "For as light figures the Impressions of all visible things, and the Air of all audible things; so the Animal Spirits, receive the impressed Images of those, and also of Odors, and tangible Qualities." Their essence was the conveyance of perceptions. Imagination and perception were thus difficult to distinguish precisely because they depended on this same vehicle. It was a vehicle not confined to any particular organ, let alone to the mind, but "Coextended to the whole Body." Willis wanted his anatomy to elucidate its workings to the full. 32 Believing that the sensitive soul functioned by the flow of animal spirits through material channels, Willis thought it possible to reveal those channels by anatomical practice. He especially hoped to identify in the brain

physical features associated specifically with such functions as memory, imagination, and the appetites. This required a novel method of dissection. He advocated "a new way of opening ye Brains," observers reported. Rather than slicing horizontal sections through the head, he uncovered the brain layer by concentric layer, thereby revealing "the order of Nature" (fig. 6.5).33 It was their embodiment in practice that lent such legitimacy to Willis's views. His anatomical works were not just texts: they were representations of practical procedure, performed before authoritative audiences, and this afforded them their unique prestige. Briefly, Willis's technique revealed two membranes enveloping the brain. The first of these membranes was loose, and in four places it formed cavities called "bosoms." Blood flowing into the brain collected in these bosoms, before fine vessels carried it down into the interior of the head. Beneath lay

the second membrane, tightly fitting the three inner structures ofcerebrum, "oblong marrow," and, to the rear, cerebellum. Its purpose was to distinguish these parts of the brain one from another, and thereby to act as a "fence" restraining the animal spirits in their proper "orbs." 34 All physicians and anatomists knew that the animal spirits had their origin in the blood. But Willis could now discern exactly where, and hence how, they were generated. He could see within each of the bosoms a matrix of strong "Fibres" that, like "flood-gates," must control the flow of blood into the brain. Additional ligaments traversing the bosoms controlled their expansion and contraction. 35 Together these fibers regulated the flow of blood through the bosoms. When full, the bosoms acted as heat sources, gradually warming the blood flowing onward in tiny vessels beneath. Eventually, "as if it were a certain Chymical operation," this blood underwent a distillation. Its subtle extracts were then channeled toward the brain by vessels in the inner membrane, which, when injected with an ink solution, could be displayed to an audience as resembling "little serpentine chanels hanging to an alembic." Like this alchemical apparatus, they served as extra "distillatory Organs," rendering the refined blood still more "subtil and elaborated" as it proceeded. At length, they admitted only the finest "Chymical Elixir" into the inner brain, in the form of animal spirits. There they circulated "as in a publick Emporium or Mart" in a "free and open space" at the base of the brain. This was the "common Sensory"-the sensus communis. Here the brain registered the "Strokes of all sensible things." It was here that impressions from the senses and the imagination were combined, and remembered ideas received. This was also the center from which the animal spirits were "directed into appropriate Nerves" for all responsive actions. A "fountain" of animal spirits continuously flowed out from the semus communis, through the spinal cord, to all parts of the body, there to "irradiate" it and spark such actions (fig. 6.6).36 The sensus communis was a space of open exchange, where the animal spirits mingled freely. But some differentiation of the motions they stimulated nevertheless remained. Most important, while the cerebrum was the site of imaginative and rationative actions, the cerebellum directed all those functions that did not rely on imagination, memory, or reason: that is, all the regular motions necessary for life. The nerves controlling respiration, nutrition, and similar functions derived their spirits from here. It seemed essential, indeed, that this distinction be maintained, for otherwise the most

basic life-preserving activities of the body would have lain vulnerable to "the winds of Passions and Cogitations." Yet even separated in this way they were not immune, for a mechanically transmitted "sympathy" linked the spirits in the cerebellum and those in the cerebrum, so that any passion excited in the latter could still produce physical symptoms. In fact, whenever "a violent passion, as Joy, Sadness, Anger, [or] Fear" arose, its "impression" would produce "notable mutations in the Organs." Hence someone subject to a fit of rage, say, experienced changes in body temperature, heart rate, and stomach functions. 37 This, then, was the dynamic system in which vision and imagination participated. Willis went on to describe how. He began by accepting the

397

camera obscura theory of the eye. On seeing an object, the "Optick Species" generated by the eye at the retina was transmitted through the optic nerves and into the brain. There a variety of things might happen. It might simply be reflected from the callous body back through the nervous system, yielding the sort of reflex action maintained even in sleep. But if it disturbed the spirits circulating in the sensus communis, then it gave rise to a passion. It could also pass still further into the cortex, when "it impresse[d] on it the image or character of the sensible Object." This generated a memory. Perception, imagination, and memory were therefore part of a single, continuous process. Seeing an object, imagining one, and reasoning with the resulting ideas and memories could never be separated from the circulation of the blood and the movements of the body. 38 Willis showed how much a skilled anatomist could do to elucidate the nature, routes, and purposes of the animal spirits, despite the impossibility of actually seeing them in action. His work was exemplary of the efforts of anatomists and natural philosophers to understand and account for such processes. More than any other, however, it was Willis's description that became influential. The fundamentals of his account came to be widely known in succeeding years, and were put to use in an extensive range of debates. The notion that vision, imagination, and the body were intimately linked, long a commonplace, had been given a newly authoritative explanation. The proper way to approach that special instance of vision that was reading would therefore need to embrace both physiology and the faculties of the mind. Fortunately, Willis's anatomical investigations had led him to a readily available set of resources to aid such an approach: those developed in the extensive literature devoted to the passions.

A DISCOURSE OF THE PASSIONS

In order to appreciate the significance of that literature, it is necessary to grasp the meaning of the term passion in early modern England. Passions were "Apprehensions, resentments, or emotions of the Soul," caused by "some motion of the spirits." That is, they were the responses excited by the senses and other stimuli, such as the imagination, when they impressed the sensus communis: passiones correspondent to the actiones of motions impinging on the brain. They included and affected both reasoned and corporeal responses. 39

CHAPTER SIX

The wide scope of this definition meant that the range of early modern passions embraced some that we would not now recognize as passions at all, the desire for knowledge being a significant example. Their study, accordingly, was reckoned to be extremely important. The philosophy of the passions, wrote Catholic priest Jean Senault, might be less formally prestigious than other branches of learning, but in reality it was fundamental to them all. "For it is she that makes Philosophers, and which purifying their understanding, makes them capable of considering the wonders of Nature." In short, all knowledge rested on a foundation of knowledge of the passions. Such learning was "to Philosophy, the same as Foundations are to Buildings." Someone possessing adequate knowledge of-and thereby control overthe passions was in a good position to become "an honest man, ... a good Father of a Family, a wise Politician, and an understanding Philosopher." Those without such knowledge would soon be forced to confess that "our Passions are chains, which make us slaves to all such as know how to manage them well" (fig. 6.7).40 In accordance with this principle, a large and popular literature had grown up-as extensive, probably, as that dealing with civility-describing the passions and drawing moral and practical conclusions from them. One of its contributing authors, Rene Descartes, had anticipated that by its title alone his own account of the passions would sell better than any ofhis other books; and the only one of his works that the young Boyle would admit to reading was this one. 41 Willis, Descartes, royal physician Walter Charleton, and others created a market for such discussions that was still flourishing in the mid-eighteenth century.42 Willis's anatomical work, which demonstrated that every "passion of the sensitive Soul" affected both the physical body and its perceptions "whether we will or no," became one of their central foundations (fig. 6.8). Chapter 2 argued that Stationers were amphibious creatures. They traversed what could be seen as essentially separate realms of commerce and civility. But there was a more profound sense, expressed by Sir Thomas Browne and others, in which every human being was a "great and true Amphibium." Each person was a soul forced to live in the alien environment of the body. It was therefore reasonable to consider the experiences, achievements, and anxieties of such a creature in terms of this disjunction. The

discourse of the passions did just that. 43 Physicians and ministers, in particular, felt themselves qualified to use this branch of knowledge, which, traversing the gulf separating body from soul, embraced embodied morality-the morality of amphibians. As Bishop Edward Reynolds expressed it when introducing his own treatise on the subject, "whereas the principall acts of mans Soule are either of Reason and Discourse, proceeding from his Understanding; or of Action and Moralitie, from his Will; both these, in the present condition of mans estate, have their dependance on the Organs and faculties of the Body." With respect to the understanding, the body was "an Eye, through which it seeth"; with respect to the will, the body was "a

Various examples of "credulity" and "superstition" are prominent, including Mary Toft, the Surrey woman who had claimed to give birth to rabbits in 1726. On the right-hand side, a thermometer of passionate states appears, its summit being that of "raving" (the same state, perhaps, as that induced in the young Boyle by reading romances).

Hand, by which it worketh." This being so, the body, while it did not possess an absolute dominion over reasoning, could exercise a "disturbing power." Its conditions and distempers affected the impressions perceived at the sensus communis, and could therefore distort the conclusions derived from them. 44 This was why the interaction between body, reason, and action that was summed up in the passions was so crucial to practical morality. What made the passions especially problematic to such writers was the postlapsarian state of humanity. Before the Fall, everyone agreed, human apprehensions had been in perfect accord with nature. The senses had "made no false reports," and, being "uninterressed," had remained in conformity with Reason. The expulsion from Eden had destroyed this harmony, throwing distortive passions between the human mind and the rest of Creation. The corrupted senses of a representative early modern reader were therefore thought to be "subject to a thousand illusions." Guided by their passions, the mind was almost certain to go wrong. 45 Charleton, for one, declared that "most commonly false Opinions are occasioned ... by our Passions." 46 The serious problem of knowledge that this implied was the reason why understanding the passions was so important. At stake were the discrimination of truth from falsity and the moral propriety of all actions resultant upon such discrimination. Contemporary understanding of the passions was complex and highly developed and can only be summarized here. In any case, it was impossible to enumerate all the passions that could affect one's knowledge. The variety of impressions constantly arriving at the brain from the senses, memory, and imagination made their number simply too great. But writers nevertheless did frame a standard taxonomy in terms of which they and their effects could be discussed. First, they recognized a division between metaphysical and physical passions. These were relatively simple: the former were restricted to the rational soul, and were familiar to divines as the affections appropriate to religious contemplation, while the latter affected the sensitive soul through material, effiuvial mechanisms. As well as these two relatively straightforward types, however, there also existed what writers called moral passions. These were much more complex, since they engaged the body and the soul in concert. It was in relation to these that writers articulated the full physiology of the passions. The first stage in generating a moral passion occurred when the senses presented a "new and strange object" to the soul, thus "giv[ing] her hope

of knowing somewhat that she knew not before." Instantly the soul "admire[d]" this image. This admiration was the primary ofall passions. It then entertained an "appetite" to know the object better, "which is called Curiosity or desire of Knowledge." Curiosity was thus the second passion. This passion was nothing less than "the mother of knowledge." On it depended all further intellectual inquiry; in particular, "all natural Philosophy, andAstronomyowe themselves to this passion." Typical genealogies then went on to recognize five more simple varieties of passion: love and hatred, desire, and joy and grief. All others were best regarded as compounds or species of these. 47 There were ways of diagnosing such passions. Their concomitant motions of spirits, as Charleton reported, "change the very countenance, gestures, [and] walking." Writers thus linked a wide variety of visible symptoms, through the physiology of the passions, to processes ofperception and imagination. For example, the primary passion, admiration, caused the animal spirits to be called into the brain to hold the image in place for consideration. Simultaneously they were also directed into the muscles holding the body in position and the eyes focused, so as to keep the organs in contact with the object. By such symptoms could it be recognized. 48 Such a repertoire of diagnostic signs permitted laypeople to become skilled interpreters of their neighbors' bodies. There is evidence that such knowledge was routinely used in the realm of face-to-face trust and suspicion described above in chapter 2. "Men judg of meanings by actions," observed Senault, "and read in the eyes, and face, the most secret motions of the soul." The benevolent use of such insight to temper one's own and others' social interactions was in large part what contemporaries meant when they spoke of prudence. By the same token, however, early modern citizens also became accustomed to concealing and "counterfeiting" their own passions. Governing the passions was essential if one were not to be left vulnerable to observers able to deploy skilled observation, and then employ what was called "craft" to put their knowledge to evil ends. Craft, to be precise, was the perversion of prudence: it was knowledge of the passions dedicated to immoral ends. Servants, with privileged access to the "upstairs" of one's premises and to one's less guarded moments, were among its more noted exponents. For those lacking such access, alcohol was a good way to circumvent dissembling

strategies: a drunk, John Earle said, was "an uncover'd man," since "all his passions come out." 49 In extreme cases, however, passions might prove not only revealing, but physically dangerous. The passion of admiration, for example, while harmless enough in normal circumstances, could produce "Stupor, or Astonishment"-perhaps even catalepsy-if suffered in excess. Such "immoderate" admiration could not but be harmful to the health. This was a pattern common to all the passions. Their physical symptoms merely revealed one's passionate state in normal circumstances, but became actively harmful in extreme ones. Physicians, above all, became familiar with the complaints accompanying such intense states. The symptoms they encountered included leanness, defects of nutrition, melancholy, scurvy, consumption, rheumatism, lameness, bloated faces, swollen limbs, amenorrhea, green sickness, fevers, and death. As Charleton warned, excessive passions could result in "the whole Oeconomy of nature" being "perverted." 50 The problem of knowledge that the passions posed had not only personal implications, but also a much wider and even more serious political significance. The conflicts wracking seventeenth-century Europe were so violent, it was argued, because central to the human condition itself was a constant civil war. Human beings contained two distinct "faculties of Knowing": the understanding, which was seated in the rational soul, and the imagination, which was seated in the sensitive. Ideally, the faculty producing knowledge should have been the understanding,51 However, the sensitive soul mediated between this faculty and the body that provided its raw materials, and was the main seat of both the imagination and the passions. By consequence a highly unstable entity, it was subject to both diseases of the body and "impressions of sensible Objects." 52 All reasoning was thus liable to be subjugated to a strife between the two candidates for knowledge. Neither could be dispensed with. Only the understanding could perform the essentially

judicial processes of constructing "trains of notions convenient either to Speculation, or to practice." These "royal prerogatives" meant that only the rational soul was properly entitled to "the whole Encyclopaedia or Zodiac of Arts and Sciences; Theology, Logic, Physic, Metaphysics, Mathematics, Algebra, Geometry, Astronomy, Mechanics." All these sciences were properly regarded as "the products or creatures of Mans Mind" (with the possible exception of theology, which was of a higher order). Nonetheless, that mind still relied on the sensitive soul for the ideas with which it worked. The imagination alone was sufficient to compound and divide sensations, thus forming ideas. A constant" intestin war" raged between the two, as Willis himself testified. The "twofold Knowing Power" in every subject, he declared, led necessarily to "wicked Combinations, troublesom Contests, and more than Civil Wars." It was a vital struggle, on the outcome of which rested the fate of every individual human being, and hence that of the polity as a whole. If the sensitive soul won, then the "divine Politie" of the rational soul would be lost forever to "the brutish lusts of the insolent usurper," and hence to its appetite for "triumphs of libidinous carnality." Moralists might with justification say that the devil "mingles himself with our most intimate corruptions, and the Seate of his warfare is the inward man." In Willis's terms, the sensitive appetite "seduces in us the Mind or Chief Soul, and snatches it away with it self, to role in the Mud of Sensual Pleasures." Charleton for one considered this the more likely outcome, "for, it is from the Imagination alone that [the soul] takes all the representations of things, and the fundamental ideas, upon which she afterward builds up all her Science." 53 Proposals to tackle this problem of knowledge consequently lay at the heart of attempts to reconstruct some degree of social and moral order out of the chaos of the Civil War-and, more widely, of the Thirty Years' War. In their various ways, such diverse figures as Charles I, Thomas Hobbes, and even the notorious republican Algernon Sidney all aimed at producing polities that could successfully discipline the inescapably passionate nature of humanity and channel it to correct ends. 54 As we have seen in chapter 4, John Streater's republicanism also partook of this aim. Their answers depended on proper forms of self-discipline, social organization, literary representation, and communication. As that implies, reading and writing were profoundly implicated. Reading consequently became an important ele53. [Charleton], Natural History of the Passions, sig.

ment-perhaps the important element-in these civil wars of both microcosm and macrocosm. The immediate reason for this lay in the very fundamentals of the practice, beginning, again, with vision. In many instances the exercise ofvisual perception seemed fairly straightforward, as when one simply "saw" a block of wood. The camera obscura model accounted for these cases perfectly well. But even in such straightforward perceptions, as everyone acknowledged and Willis explained, vision was necessarily refracted through the natural economy of the passions. There were other cases in which this became extremely clear, because some active conditioning of that economy must be involved in them. Speaking, listening, writing, and reading were examples. In each of these cases, simple camera obscura-like perception must necessarily be abetted by a degree of unconscious conditioning. An agreed account of this conditioning was widely available, according to which "habits" had grown up in each individual facilitating the practice in question. The motions of the animal spirits, and thence the passions and imagination, in response to certain particular sensations had been regularized over long periods of repetition. A habit of this sort was in effect a tamed, artificial passion. In learning to speak, for example, one "habituated" the motions of the spirits so that one had only to imagine what one wished to say, rather than specifying the countless individual movements of the body that together produced audible speech. The "habit" acquired in developing speech, said Descartes, had "taught us to joyn the action of the Soul, ... the tongue, and the lipps, with the signification of the words which follow out of these motions, rather than with the motions themselves." Similar habituation allowed a subject to understand speech immediately, without having to undergo a conscious parsing ofheard sounds into intelligible syllables. And it was again habituation that permitted one to read words "by the figure of their letters, when they are written." Accustomed responses rendered the translation of seen images into legible characters virtually instantaneous and entirely indiscernible. Reading itself depended upon a habituated passion. 55 The concept of habits was also central to the essential task of disciplining and pacifying the passions themselves. Habits were held to be the best hope an individual had of countering immoral, unhealthy, excessive, or erroneous passions. Habituation provided the key to exerting some practical "Regulation" or "mitigation" of them and their effects. Such action was regarded as essential for English gentlemen. Without effective control of their passions, human beings remained slaves to their own corporeality, denied the freedom

CHAPTER SIX

of action definitive of the gentle state. 56 Although the rational soul could not simply remove such passions, it could perhaps habituate the individual to physiological responses taming them. There were two principal means by which this might be effected, both of which could be seen to depend on the labyrinthine matrices of vessels in the brain that Willis had revealed. First, one could imagine objects producing a passion contrary to that being experienced. Pursued intensely and at length, this could eventually produce a habit separating the motions of the blood and spirits from the impressions to which they would naturally be consequent, by accustoming them to passing through alternative channels. And second, one could learn to delay judgment of an impression, perhaps by doggedly reciting the letters of the alphabet or the Lord's Prayer. This would allow the turbulence of the spirits to recede, permitting the rational soul a more detached interpretationY Contrariety and hesitation: these were the roures to virtue. Senault in fact proposed that the history of the arts and sciences constitured a series of "documents" of such efforts, urging that "the government of Passions is of such importance, and so difficult, as the better part of sciences seem only to have been invented to regulate them." 58 The habituation process reckoned so fundamental to reading was thus the same as that proposed as the solution to the political problem of the passions. This was one reason why both Hobbes and Locke reckoned habituation "the great Thing to be minded in Education." "Education, and Discipline" were conceived to be vital for channeling and restraining the passions. Prudence should be cultivated; its depraved counterpart, "craft" or "cunning," must be shunned. 59 Locke believed that "the great Principle and Foundation ofall Vertue and Worth" was "that a Man is able to deny himself his own Desires, cross his own Inclinations, and purely follow what Reason directs as best, tho' the appetite lean the other way," and insisted that education was the key to "imprinting" such prudence. He envisaged education in terms of the instilling of "Habits" into the minds of children by "little, and almost insensible Impressions." His recipe for bringing up young gentlemen was therefore strongly reminiscent of many recommended remedies for excessive or inappropriate passions. "By repeating the same Action till it be grown habitual in them, the Performance will not depend on Memory,

or Reflection," he insisted, "but will be natural." By following this strategy to eradicate every unwanted habituation, the tutor could eventually "weed them out all, and plant what Habits you please." Bowing to a gentleman, for example, would become "as natural ... as breathing." According to Locke, only one appetite was carefully to be fostered by the pedagogue: the passion of "Curiosity." This was because his aim should be to inculcate "a love of Credit." The inescapable role of curiosity in the pursuit and acquisition of knowledge made it a central element in the formation of a gentleman. Its importance applied especially in the process of learning to read, which must be encouraged by manipulating a child's curiosity through its desire for enjoyment. The early development of reading skills demanded delicacy and care. Choosing the right materials, and ensuring that children approached them in the right ways, would rarely be straightforward, and mistakes at this stage could result in danger later. The provision of cautionary advice started early. Parents were urged "above all" to keep their offspring from pamphlets, "the Primers of all Vice." One manual of childbirth opened by showing that printing had done more harm than guns, by at least a factor of ten. And even Locke himselfseemed unsure what to recommend from the many titles competing for parents' favor. But in the end he insisted that early reading experiences must be in the form of games, not chores. By such means, he claimed, "Children may play themselves into what others are whipp'd for." When they graduated to reading their first books, works such as Aesop would be most suitable, since they combined moral lessons with "entertainment." Editions with pictures were best of all, since the images would provide a Lockean child with the necessary "Idea's" to comprehend the text. To disregard this advice and set formal tasks was to risk permanently damaging the children in one's care. "Neither their Minds nor Bodies will bear it," Locke warned. "It injures their Healths." 60 Locke believed that education made his contemporaries "Wellftshion'd" and able to display an "internal Civility of the Mind." And there is evidence that English subjects were indeed fashioned in this way. Throughout the early modern period, and on into the Victorian era, practicing tutors put just such notions of the nature of the child into effect, especially during the most elementary stages of education. Their catechizing and similar techniques were not (or not just) the mindless rote-learning drudgery familiar from later caricature. In fact, they rested explicitly on the assumption that correct habits must be imprinted on children while they were still malleable, and improper appetites drained of all potency through constant drilling.

The resulting pedagogic practices, and the genres of literature they employed, helped form generations of men and women. Represenrations of the physiology of reading were thus perhaps instrumenral in creating an entire British population notoriously ready to rein in its passions. 61 But improper education could be correspondingly harmful. Bemoaning his own wandering mind, Boyle himself remarked on the misery attending "Persons that are borne with such Busy Thoughts, not to have congruent Objects propos'd to them at First." 62 Citing Willis, John Webster likewise argued that an "evil education" could cause "a most deep impression of the verity of the most gross and impossible things" to be "instamped in [pupils'] fancies, hardly ever after in their whole life time to be obliterated or washt out." He thought this true especially of pupils of melancholic disposition. It was a conventional opinion-and it meshed perfectly with Boyle's diagnosis of his own reading of romances. A poor education could instill inappropriate habits into the human frame, and thereby condition the subject for the rest of his or her life to experience improper, and perhaps even harmful, responses while reading. Unfortunately, not all pupils were appropriately trained. Physicians, Willis among them, became as accustomed to treating the symptoms of improper or excessive reading as those of the passions. They found that excessive reading could bring on a vast range of conditions. Many of them were experienced disproportionately by women, as could be explained readily enough in terms of the heightened sensitivity regularly attributed to the female body. One seventeenth-century physician thus noted that his patients complained to him that their reading brought on insomnia, breathlessness, trembling, upset stomachs, vertigo, headaches, ringing ears, "rising" sensations, and swooning. Such complaints persisted in the face of even the most fearsome seventeenth-century remedies. 63 For women in particular they were to prove highly consequential.

and what idolatrous forgery, of how Scripture should be represented and read, and ofwhat effects it should have on which readers consequently stood at the heart of its identity.64 The making of authoritative, recognized texts of Scripture-the Authorized Version being by far the most importantstructured its history. But Protestants felt themselves under threat. The dangers posed by popery, superstition, enthusiasm, and atheism appeared both all too real and all too united. 65 In these circumstances, the credit of books professing religious knowledge became a key battleground. And arguments connecting the reading of Scripture to the human frame and the soul became central to the discrimination of true faith from error, and even from heresy. This was most prominently displayed in the combats, well known to historians, over what antagonists called "enthusiasm." As defined by two of its major opponents, Henry More and Meric Casaubon, enthusiasm was "nothing else but a mis-conceit of being inspired." It was the conviction, held especially by some of the Interregnum's more notorious religious radicals, that at certain moments God would enter into direct communication with them, and that at such moments he would grant them privileged knowledge by immediate personal revelation. 66 Such a belief clearly warranted drastic action on the part of its holder. It threatened social upheaval of unlimited extent and duration. Whether or not it actually incited violent rebellion, this led to its increasing stigmatization as a leading cause of the Civil War. More and Casaubon in the 1650s, and the Latitudinarians thereafter, were in the front line of the assault. Their campaign against enthusiasm has long been identified as an element in the articulation of "modest" schemes for experimental learning, although again the true extent of its importance remains controversial. This section presents a new account of enthusiasm and its repudiation. It argues that concepts of the passionate character of reading, and of the proper self-management that they demanded, were central to the experiences and arguments of both "enthusiasts" and their enemies. The debate over enthusiasm was a debate over the political and personal ramifications of reading. It is appropriate to begin with the experiences recorded by an enthusiast himself. John Rogers, born in 1627, is an excellent candidate. He was among the most notorious of all enthusiasts, and, for reasons shortly to become clear, we can trace the role of reading in Rogers's development with

exemplary clarity. Rogers's life was repeatedly punctuated by two kinds of confrontation with God: reading and visions. Hellfire sermons heard in his boyhood had filled him with terror, and, propelled by his fear, he had scoured the Scriptures. The young Rogers had "read every day," he recalled: "I knew not what I read, but only thought the bare reading was enough." He learned his catechism by heart, reciting it as a talisman against the demons he knew were lurking under every bush; he wrote down the sermons he heard, and learned those too; he memorized morning and evening prayers, "out of a book, for I knew no better yet." All this reading threw Rogers into despair over his prospects for salvation, and he descended into suicidal despondency. Distraught, he "took the Bible," turned to the relevant pages, and "read them over and over and over again." It did little good: "the more I read the more I roar'd in the black gulf of despair." He would "read, and weep, and ... fall flat (all along) with my face on the ground, and cry, and call, and sigh, and weep, and call for help." At length Rogers gave up reading altogether, feeling tempted to conclude that "there was no God" and that "all things come by Nature." It was a classic symptom of the despair leading to atheism and damnation. 67 He began to see demons not just under the bushes but in them, and to sit up all night in a turret in his father's orchard, wailing and drawing strange figures. Finally, as he was about to commit suicide, he was seized and tied to a bed until his fits subsided. From this point Rogers's condition had improved somewhat, stabilizing at an "inward malady" of "melancholy." He dreamed about Scriptute itself-"the letter which killed me"-and that the righteousness of Christ would be sufficient for his salvation. He awoke from this dream transformed. Rogers had long acknowledged that his dreams "seised much upon my spirits." But he had regarded them as products of his own "fancy" (that is, his imagination). This dream was different: far from emerging out of his body, it had transformed it. "I was so much changed that I was amazed at my self," he recalled. Now it was his previous reality that seemed imaginary. He leaped up, exclaiming, "Why, I am not damned! what's the matter? am I so filled with afancy?" Again his response was to turn to the Bible. He pored over its pages with new attention until, "divine infusions ... writing it within me," he achieved "assurance of salvation." It was only now that Rogers could begin "plainly to see my self (and by my self others)." Expelled from his family's home, Rogers wandered to Cambridge. There he called the devil's attempts to lure him into necromancy a ''passion.'' He would "fall to prayer [or] reading" in an attempt to ward it off. At his lowest

ebb, reduced to near-starvation in a Cambridge garret, Rogers had another dream. He dreamed that he was walking, staff in hand, to his father's house. At first he could hardly see the path, and even began to question its existence; but at length he noticed footprints from others who had passed the same way before. He followed them, and as he did so the path became clearer. Before long a fine mansion appeared to his left, from which emerged a beam of light that partially blocked Rogers's way. He walked around it. But as he did so he happened to touch the beam, and the house immediately butst into flame. He was soon overtaken by an angry posse violently accusing Rogers himself of having started the conflagration. The furious mob dragged him off to prison, at which, terrified, he awoke. Finding himself safe in his Cambridge garret, Rogers chided himself for being scared at "a foolish fancy." He fell asleep again. But immediately he sank back into the same dream, which repeated itself from beginning to end-except that this time Rogers the pilgrim found himself accompanied by an old, bearded man, who provided reassurance that God had selected him to preach his Word. This "grave ancient man" proceeded to interpret the whole of Rogers's dream from within the dream itself. The house represented heaven, his father, God, and his staff, God's Word. Rogers would be troubled by the various ways of men, he but would follow the example (the footprints) of the saints and would find his path becoming clearer. The magnificent house represented the "great ones of the world." They were at present proud and ostentatious, and Rogers was to preach against themthe beam represented the cluster of powers and opinions he must circumvent in order to do so. The worldly powers would soon fall, but they would pursue Rogers and blame him for their catastrophe. With that, Rogers awoke again and found that it was finally dawn. The Cambridge "dream and vision," as he now called it, changed Rogers to the extent that his entire identity was transmuted. As he himself succinctly put it, "I am not I." Assured of salvation, and with his self freshly refashioned, Rogers set forth on a pilgrimage that would lead to both Fifth Monarchism and, eventually, medicine. 68 Preaching in Dublin in the early 1650s, Rogers collected from his listeners a long series of what he called "experiences," which he later caused to be printed. The origin of these testimonies lay in the procedure for admitting new members to his church. Before joining, he explained, every would-be congregant must attest to "some EXPERMENTAL [sic] Evidences of the work of GRACE upon his SOUL . . . whereby he (or she) is convinced, that he is regenerate." That is, everyone was expected to provide a record (often an oral

record, since the subject was unlikely to be an accomplished writer) of a transformation such as Rogers himself had enjoyed-a transformation, that is, into a new and "assured" self. This was summed up in a simple formula: "Experience, we say, proves principles." 69 Rogers's own Cambridge "experience"-indeed, his entire self-fashioning as constructed in this extensive testimony-constituted his personal contribution to this effort. The history presented here was an artifact of his experimental faith. Rogers's own experience was innocuous compared to some ofhis congregants', which reflected in full the disease, murder, and war destroying Irish life in the 1640s. Yet the resulting accounts do betray certain common characteristics, showing the extent to which Rogers's experience was typical of so-called enthusiasts. Like Rogers himself, his subjects had often been brought up in families they described as godly. But they had at first practiced merely what they called "book" (or "legal") religion. They had then passed through a critical period, characterized as a death and rebirth, and emerged transformed, assured of their salvation. The conversions themselves generally came about by one or more of a relatively small number of possible mechanisms that, it was said, "wrought upon" and thereby "affected" the individual concerned. Hearing sermons, reading books, and having visions were the three main ones. Each was described in intimate terms. In each case success was then ascribed to the holy spirit's having "wrought" within the subject: their accounts of reading Scripture, for example, often displayed a sense of helplessness before the Word. Thus one Raphael Swinfield described how he was first "affected" by hearing Puritan preachers, becoming "disconsolate" and "diseased." Then, he related, a "place in Isa. 50.10. came into me" and 'fasten[edl upon me," insisting that Swinfield should trust in God. To reinforce the point, he had a dream that convinced him of his assurance. John Cooper was also converted by a dream, as were a number of others. Francis Bishop, condemned to be shot, "turned open the Bible" and read a passage enjoining him to trust in God; when he resolved to do so, he was freed. Hugh Leeson was first "wrought upon" by his wife, "whom God made the first Instrument of my good; by her often reading of the Scriptures to me ... and by the Spirits working within me, with it." Adrian Strong testified that "by the word preached, and read out of good Books and the Bible, I was brought in to God." Finally, Mary Barker was converted by all means short of visions: by "preaching, and praying, and reading, in private and publique." 70

These people, whose testimony was either written down by themselves or taken down from their own words, claimed that visions-and inspiration in general-occurred in definite cultural and practical conditions. They particularly stressed their experiences of reading Scripture, and how those experiences changed in the course of their descent into "disease" and transforming ascent into "assurance." In fact, one could characterize their personal experiences as transformations in reading practices. 71 The torpid routines of "book religion" were swept aside as God "irradiated" them directly during their exposure to Scripture. Radicals even referred to themselves as possessing an internal "Book of Conscience," "imprinted" by God's spirit to produce their visions. Appropriating mystical, alchemical, and Paracelsian sources, they spoke of the imagination, or "fancy," representing such images to the reason, which could then elaborate them into knowledge. 72 Analyzing their "experiences" of reading thus meant representing states of mind and of the body simultaneously. Rogers and his like clearly thought about the body as well as the soul. Some actually pursued medicine: William Walwyn, Laurence Clarkson, and Abiezer Coppe practiced physic, while Rogers himself eventually gained medical degrees from both Utrecht and Oxford. Medical practitioners or not, however, radicals commonly described their religious transformations by reference to the passions.?3 This being so, it should not be surprising that women in particular found their experiences transforming. As Mack remarks, "seventeenth-century men and women felt certain kinds of knowledge"-and women felt them more strongly than men. Their bodies, conventionally represented as far more sensitive than those of men, purportedly rendered them all the more prone to the passions. That was why they were deemed particularly susceptible to the pathologies of reading, such as the violent headaches experienced by Anne Conway and Queen Mary. But it also had more ambivalent consequences in a society that denied advanced educational opportunities to almost all women. On the one hand, female creativity of all kinds was liable to denigration and distrust as a mere product of the passions. It was thus readily identifiable, as chapter 2 showed, with other supposedly female traits such as gossip, inconstancy, and even infidelity. To hostile eyes, the women prophets of the 1640S and beyond therefore merely displayed with unusual

vividness a physiological difference that existing medical and ethical authorities insisted to be universal between the sexes. On the other hand, however, male scholars could also choose to see this sensitivity as liberating. Themselves irredeemably reliant on the tortuous mechanisms of reason, they might envy the untutored immediacy with which women prophets could seem to experience their "conversations with God." John Rogers himself remarked that women were often quicker to perceive spiritual truths than men, since they were "more readily wrought upon." This had immediate consequences extending beyond the epistemic value attached to women's readings. Through their claims to privileged knowledge, it affected the development of women's authorship itself. .AJ; noted in chapter 2, women authors began to appear on an appreciable scale only in the 1640S. When they did, most were prophets newly transformed by the kinds of experience just described. About three hundred women are known to have become vociferously active in the radical religious movements thrown up by the disorder of the Civil War. Inspired, as Rebeckah Travers put it, not by "ink and paper" but by "spirit, life, and power," many either published their experiences or saw them published by others. The contrast was qualitative as well as quantitative. The most prolific woman writer of the sixteenth century had probably been Queen Elizabeth I; the most prolific of the entire seventeenth was Lady Eleanor Davies, the extraordinary prophet who emerged at Charles I's court and remained active into the 1650s. This unprecedented development sprang directly from arguments exploiting the physiology of reading. For once, the peculiar predicament in which contemporary representations of female nature placed them allowed women to venture into print while averting conventional charges ofimmodesty and insubordination. Some actually attempted to transcend a realm of epistemic authority that was so consistently gendered by denying their womanhood altogether. Several explicitly claimed to have become men-not just by adopting male pseudonyms, but by announcing themselves as possessing male souls in their female bodies. These were surely the most amphibious of amphibians. Even more radical was the strategy of suppressing one's human nature altogether. Some could infer such suppression even while preserving the unique female sensitivity to visions generated through the passions. Appropriating traditional forms dating from the Middle Ages, women thus testified while struck dumb, while in a trance, or while emaciated and bedridden in the grip of a harrowing fast. What more legitimate authority for publication could there be than a direct message from the Holy Spirit, apprehended with vivid intensity and unshackled from the corrupt forms of human learning? The possibilities opened up by this unanswerable ques-

tion survived the Restoration and changed the conditions of authorship for good,74 Such possibilities were always likely to raise terrors in many minds. John Rogers, Rebeckah Travers, Mary Cary, Elizabeth Poole-these were precisely the people whom Samuel Parker, Henry More, Meric Casaubon, and others had in mind when they condemned "enrhusiasts." Medical knowledge could be of value on their side of the conflict too. Antienrhusiast polemics generally charged that talk of inspiration was either deliberate imposture or evidence of madness. Credit and the human frame were brought into collision in such polemics. The imagination was well known to be unstable and capricious, the seat of "distempers" affecting the mind. "Without better evidence then their bare word," Joseph Sedgwick argued in 1653, "we may modestly suspect that [enthusiasts' visions] are nothing but the distempers of a disaffected brain." Others simply manifested "counterfeit inspiration." George Hickes agreed, defining enthusiasm as "Spiritual drunkenness, or Lunacy." It "distemper[ed] the minds of men," he elaborated, "with extravagant phancies." William Ramesay likewise opined that those who "in their Enthusiasm" aspired to prophesy typically went mad. 75 A major problem with such argumenrs, however, was that they threatened to outlaw much that their proponents themselves wanted to defend. Sedgwick, for instance, acknowledged the importance of "experience" in much the same sense as Rogers's, and Ralph Cudworth accepted that of "irradiation." Quite as much as Rogers's congregants, Cudworth went out of his way to reject the idea that religion was simply "Book-craft." Only when a spiritual truth was found "within our selves," he maintained, could we be said to be "experimentally acquainted with it." "All the Books and Writings which we converse with," Cudworth told Parliament, "can but represent Spiritual Objects to our understandings; which yet we can never see in their own true Figure, Colour and Proportion, until we have a Divine Light within, to irradiate and shine upon them." Such irradiated representation could happen only in the imagination. Cudworth also defined holiness as "nothing else but God stamped and printed upon the Soul." Such language was strikingly similar to that of the very enthusiasts whom

Cudworth, along with More, Sedgwick, Smith, and Casaubon, wished to proscribe. The crux of the conflict would therefore lie in the practical application of these arguments: the actual discrimination of proper "irradiation" from improper, and of true reading from false.?6 Sir Thomas Browne provided one clue as to how to exercise such judgment. He reckoned that grounds for discrimination lay in the apparent mode of conveyance of candidate visions, alleging that the "the revelations of heaven are conveied by new impressions, and the immediate illumination of the soul; whereas the deceiving spirit, by concitation of humors, produceth his conceited phantasmes." 77 That is, true visions partook of the immaterial soul. False visions, like ordinary perceptions of the outside world, relied on corporeal mediation and therefore always arose in the body. They could never engage directly and exclusively with the rational soul. Henry More likewise alleged that "Enthusiasts for the most part are intoxicated with vapours from the lowest region of their Body." His fellow Platonist John Smith agreed, describing false visions as "seated only in the imaginative power," and ascribing the "many enthusiastical impostors ofour age" to this phenomenon. This was no mere academic distinction: it suggested ways to discriminate in practice between true prophecy and self-idolatry. A false vision was one that could not "rise up above this low and dark region of sense or matter." Aristotelian reasoning straightforwardly implied that since it originated in the realm of change, it must always manifest instability and conflict. The "prophetical spirit" could therefore be discerned from the "pseudo-prophetical," Hales affirmed, because the latter could "rise no higher than the middle region of man, which is his fancy, there dwells as in storms and tempests, and ... is also conjoined with alienations and abruptions of mind." Such symptoms, he added, were "commonly observed by physicians." 78 Hales was not the only person to reckon that physicians were well acquainted with the corporeal signs accompanying false inspiration. Reference to commonly held beliefs about the structure of the body and a physician's role in interpreting its signs recurred widely. By the end of the seventeenth century, and probably before, such criteria constituted the main resource for defining enthusiasm and visions. Antagonists therefore alleged that an ex76.

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF READING

perience of apparent inspiration was in fact a "distemper." It was a physiological condition, needing to be cured rather than exorcized or idolized. 79 In short, it had natural causes. Analysis of visions was therefore a diagnostic exercise, the chief tool for which was knowledge of the passions. Henry More exemplified the approach. More knew Cartesian philosophy better than anyone else in the country at this time-he it was who introduced it into English intellectual culture, in the context of this very struggle against enthusiasm-and he singled out Descartes's Passions ofthe Soule as an influential work. 50 it is unsurprising that, like Descartes, More placed the passions at the center of his analysis. 80 According to his trearment, enthusiasm was nothing more than the consequence of an excess of "ecstatical passion," reinforcing an "illusion of the imagination." This was the consequence of a broader account of the human perceptions and reasoning. Although his own proffered physiology did not agree with Willis's, which he regarded as materialist, More concurred with the 5edleian Professor that in practice reasoning could never be separated from corporeal perceptions. It therefore must always be prey to "Phantasmes." "Thoughts," he believed, "offer or force themselves upon the mind, ... according to the nature or strength of the complexion of our Bodies."81 In certain individuals (especially women), and in certain circumstances, the images thus presented in the imagination became as strong as those sensed in the outside world-and in such a case the party concerned could scarcely fail to confuse the two. The dreams experienced while sleeping were a canonical instance. Here was the real source for alleged experiences of inspiration. In their dreams, enthusiasts attained a state of "Extasie," in which the imagination was able to dominate the sensus communis to such an extent that the memory was "as thoroughly sealed therewith, as from the sense of any external Object." 82 Thomas Hobbes reputedly died with this explanation on his lips: "Dreams are the Reverse of our waking Imaginations; the motion when we are awake, beginning at one end, and when we dream, at the other." 83 The most systematic analysis of the political implications was to be found

in the greatest of all discourses on the passions, Hobbes's Leviathan. His most perceptive critic, Seth Ward, told Hobbes that his reasoning had "never risen beyond imagination, or the first apprehension of bodies performed in the brain." 84 He had a point. The passions played a central part in Hobbes's work. Since they stimulated all human actions, and no polity could ever reach such a state of perfection that their disruptive consequences could be eradicated, the passions lay at the root of both social order and social disorder. Hobbes analyzed the processes of reasoning, will, and memory as dependent on them-understanding, for example, was achieved as the result of that passion, the"desire of Knowledge." 85 Appropriating the common interpretation of passions writers, Hobbes maintained that the experience of a dream, along with false apparitions and spurious claims to prophecy, derived from the difficulty of distinguishing perceptions received from the outside world from imagined ones generated internally. He thus maintained that those who worshiped such nonexistent spiritual beings were in effect idolaters, "in awe of their own imaginations," and that the observable variety of such religions in the world was but a simple consequence of "the different Fancies, Judgements, and Passions." 86 Madness, similarly, was "nothing else, but too much appearing Passion," which could appear in certain circumstances as "inspiration." Enthusiasts and madmen alike were liable to be "cast out of Society" altogether, whence they existed in a state of "perpetuall war, of every man against his neighbour." That is, they occupied a position that was as close as Hobbes's contemporaries ever came to the state of nature-"that miserable condition of Warre, which is necessarily consequent ... to the naturalI Passions of men." If unrestrained, such "singular Passions" became "the Seditious roaring of a troubled Nation." This was why Hobbes pursued with such dedication the advocates of priestcraft and scholasticism. Their philosophy was merely "a description of their own Passions," and therefore "rather a Dream than Science." It warranted claims to inspiration, whether by priests or sectaries, and therefore led inexorably to civil warY In an enthusiast, then, the sensitive soul was well on the way to winning the microcosmic civil war: the "Imaginative facultie has the preheminence above the Rationall." 88 As writers on the passions declared, at the height of that war the subject "acted little less than like a Daemoniack possess'd with

a Legion." 89 Since enthusiasts effectively surrendered their reason to their passions, far from being emancipated by their "visions," as they themselves claimed, they were in fact delivering themselves up to merely mechanical reflexes. More and his friend Ralph Cudworth had a name for such individuals. They called them "Neurospasts." Enthusiasts were marionettes, "meer Puppets" subjugated to the mechanisms of their bodies. Since they had let the sensitive soul dominate completely, they had reverted to the status of mere beasts. The body ofsuch a person became "perfectly Cartesius his Machina." 90 But More now faced the same problem of practical demarcation encountered by Cudworth and others. In the 1640S, he himself had published Platonic poems that had expressed what looked very like ecstasies. Was he then, as his opponent Thomas Vaughan claimed, "sick of that Disease I would pretend to cure others of"? More could see the point. He himself confessed that he had "a natural touch of Enthusiasm in my complexion." 91 To illustrate the difference between his own experiences and the professed inspirations of the enthusiast, however, he now recounted a dream he himself claimed to have had at around the time of the outbreak of the Civil War. More had experienced this remarkable dream at much the same time as Rogers, on the other side of Cambridge, was falling asleep to dream ofGod. A comparison between the two is highly instructive. More had dreamed that he was at a friend's house on the road between England and Scotland. Leaving this house on a bright moonlit night, he saw a series of huge figures in the sky, most prominent among them that of an old man with a long beard. Lying on his side in the heavens, this figure made a number of gestures with his arm; and finally, as More reentered the house, he intoned, "There is indeed love amongstyou, but onely according to theflesh." Back indoors, More was able to tell his companions the import of the vision, "expounding the generall meaning of my dream in my dream." He interpreted the movements of the old man's arm as "an Embleme of the proceedings of God when he chastises a nation," adducing "reasons out of Aristotles Mechanicks, which I had very lately read," for the precise nature of the movements. It appeared to have been a true vision, with a valid and substantial message. But then More revealed that "the Vision (as I may so

call it) in this dream" had a terrestrial origin after all. He had been reading Ptolemy's Geographia the evening before, and seeing a particular iconographic figure on the engraved frontispiece, "my fancy it seems having laid hold on his venerable beard, drew in thereby the whole scene of things that presented themselves to me in my sleep" (fig. 6.9). Both More and Rogers described remarkable dreams springing from impressive reading experiences. Both identified their dreams as moments of personal transformation. But they were important to them in directly contradictory ways. Rogers had moved from dismissing his dreams as artifacts of "fancy" to respecting them as genuine visions, and simultaneously from despair at the impossibility of his salvation to assurance that that was itself mere "fancy." More had pursued the opposite trajectory. From a belief that he had experienced a real vision, he had convinced himself that his striking dream was the product of his own "Fancy." One's imagination could evidently be imprinted entirely naturally by an image on the frontispiece of Ptolemy, without one's being aware ofany unusual effects. 92 It could happen to anybody, and could produce a seeming vision of utterly convincing reality. More went on to mention an even more convincing" Vision or Enthusiasme" that he had again experienced after reading Aristotle's Mechanicks. A description he had read there of a lever-based machine for timber moving had raised such a "Temper and frame of spirit" in him, he recalled, that "I should be prone to suspect something more then naturall in what preceded it, did I not consider that sometimes there may be of it self such a Terrour and Disposition of body, that may either suggest or imitate what is most holy or divine." 93 Such an awareness of the power of reading to create visions through the mechanisms of the body was far from unique to More. The effects of representing images seen in print in the imagination were well known. For example, natural magic books and books of secrets often suggested that would-be parents concerned to produce handsome children should place in their bedchambers "images of Cupid, Adonis, and Ganymedes, ... that they may alwayes have them in their eyes." The imagination also raised difficult problems of idolatry, especially when, as here, the mental images involved were of bearded old men. Puritans had long wanted to discipline such imaginative constructs out of existence, replacing them with schemes of words

able to act as their own mnemonics: that is, by printed Ramist diagrams. As Aston puts it, every Protestant was obliged to "act the iconoclast on the idolprocesses of his mind." 94 As this strategy itself implied, however, words themselves could have similar effects. Who could wonder that Chrysostom had dreamed of Saint Paul, Sir Thomas Browne asked, since he read Paul's Epistles "dayly"? These were "butt animal visions." In his own attack on enthusiasm, Meric Casaubon likewise concentrated on what he called "the strange, but natural effects" produced by words. Metaphors, for example, worked by the "representation of shapes and images" to the imagination-that is, they worked "by a kind ofEnthusiasme." Casaubon himself could testify that when he read a passage from a classical poet, "I do not only phansy to my self, that I see those things that they describe; but also find in my self (as I phansy) the very same content and pleasure, that I should, if my eyes beheld them in some whether coloured, or carved representation of some excellent Artist." The error of the enthusiast lay in attributing to such experiences the status of certain, even divine, ttuth. 95 Casaubon agreed that enthusiasts were suffering from a medical condition: they should go to a "Physician of the body." But he did not want such a strategy to be too widely applied. In particular, Casaubon did not wish to deny the reality of demons altogether. Those who had done so, he noted, had attempted to attribute all spirits to "a depraved fancy, or imagination." He had in mind men like John Webster, who applied his account of the power of educating the passions to explain away spirits entirely, alleging that they were "effects of the imaginative function depraved by the fumes of the melancholick humor." Angelologists, on the contrary, reckoned that angels could manipulate images already present in the imagination in order to produce apparent visions, although they could not generate new ones ex nihilo. According to Webster, reading could either cause such "effects" or, indeed, eliminate them. Webster even cited the case ofa student who, by the careful reading of sacred books, had been able to expel a devil from his posterior. 96 Such writers, like Casaubon, had pointed out "how easily [the imagination] may represent to it self Devils, and Spirits," which "may make great im94.

423

pressions in the brain, and offer themselves in sleep, or when the brain is sick." But Casaubon insisted that demons did exist. Moreover, theyoperated, like angels, precisely by casting "false species" into the imagination. Denying spirits meant also denying angels. In this too Casaubon agreed with Willis, Glanvill, and More. But he now found himself facing an extraordinarily delicate problem. Casaubon believed that those denying the existence of spirits were "Atheists." Yet such "atheists" relied on almost exactly the same arguments from imagination and the passions that he himself employed to crush enthusiasts. The difference was that the atheist relegated every spirit phenomenon to the imagination. But if there were absolutely no such phenomena not reducible to the passions, Casaubon demanded, then "What hath he left to us, that we can call truth"?97 This question-the question of what could still be trusted as truth, if experience were entirely subjected to the imagination-was fundamental. It was especially fundamental when related to reading. Such an error was at its most dangerous, needless to say, when what was being read was Scripture itself. A Protestant reading the Bible was using the eyes provided by God to "satisfie himself and others" in matters of "trust and consequence." It was this that made the correct habituation of reading so important. But enthusiasts' reading practices were dangerous. Casaubon illustrated this by the example of an ancient bishop, Synesius. Synesius used to begin reading a text, then close his eyes and extrapolate from what he had read a passage so harmonious with the work that nobody listening could tell that he was no longer reading. "It is likely that he often practised it by himself, before he adventured to do it before others," Casaubon admitted, and the applauding audience probably did not know any more of the work being read than what they had just heard. Nonetheless, "what he so supplied by his extemporary wit, did sometimes prove to be the very same that he found afterwards in the book." Such performative reading captured the fundamentals of delusive inspiration: deceit, prodigy, and display. That was why it should "very properly be referred to some kind of enthusiasme." 98 A fundamental reason for this lay in the culture of discredit surrounding printed books. Enthusiasts, pursuing their professed inspirations to the exclusion of all prudence, credited the imaginative passions generated in their reading far too readily. That was why they fell foul of the sort of strong

CHAPTER SIX

impressions that had caused More's dream (and Rogers's). At the same time, this also meant that they credited printed books in general far too readily. By contrast, in Casaubon's eyes books were not necessarily trustworthy. Writers and printers were prone to produce "lyes, or frauds," especially if convinced that the end justified doing so. "What a world of lyes and counterfeit books" had "the conceit of piae fraudes" produced, for example, and "how many have been gulled and deceived by them, who doth not know, or hath not heard?" Casaubon insisted that reading must therefore be not a passive imprinting on the mind-the writing of a supposedly divine spirit-but an active and critical labor. Given the culture that he perceived around him, the production of safe (and true) knowledge depended utterly on this. He had a point. Even the Bible itself could be corrupted, his contemporaries feared, and small variations in such a text could have momentous consequences. The entire Arian schism could be explained by the misconstrual ofa single Greek letter. And the "errors" could indeed be deliberate. As early as 1538, Thomas Elyot had found it necessary to list heresies so that they could be "the sooner espyed and abhorred in suche bokes, where they be craftily enterlaced with holsom doctrine." William Bentley claimed that a notorious 1653 misprint of I Corinthians 6: 9-"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall inherit the Kingdom of God?"-had generated sectarian enthusiasm in Casaubon's own time, since "many Libertines and licentious people did produce, and urge this Text from the authority of this corrupt Bible ... , in justification of their vicious and inordinate Conversations." Proposals for a polyglot bible therefore stressed its purity from errors generated "by the wilful corruption of Sectaries, and Hereticks, which (as was foretold) abound in these latter times." Isaac Newton too endorsed the likelihood of intentional corruption, warning of an elaborate Catholic plot to obliterate sound Scripture by printing debased Trinitarian copies in vast numbers at presses in Spain and Italy. In Newton's eyes, the Trinitarians were powerful not because they were right, but because they possessed the most sophisticated of printing houses and distribution networks. All modern editions of the Bible were therefore suspect to him, whatever critical apparatus they might display-or, more precisely, the more elaborate the apparatus, the more suspect the edition. Others made a theological point of the concern. Before the Fall, Hales argued, just as the senses had apprehended Creation faithfully, so God had communicated his laws directly into the mind. With such communication there had been no possible doubt about "who the author was, and how far his intent and meaning reacht." But this certainty had ceased as soon as the Word was written down. It was "a great argument of our shame and imperfection," then, "that the holy

things are written in books." The press had not obviated the problem. Edmond Halley might assert that "since the Invention of Printing" the survival of "exactly the same" texts had been virtually assured, but the veracity of those texts and the validity of their applications depended on their printers and readers. Yet, Ward cautioned, the literal variations encountered in different bibles ought not to lead readers "to conclude the books not to be credited." Otherwise, he pointed out, "upon the same reason it will be concluded that no Book in the world is to be credited." On the contrary, God himself had preserved such variations deliberately. He had done so to prove a point: that comparison by appropriately laborious readers could reveal "both the true sence and the true reading" of Scripture. Errata were matters of providence. 99 Such writers argued that there was no labor more noble and more necessary than that devoted to revealing false books. It required enormous skill in obscure languages, customs, and fashions. This was one major reason why Casaubon questioned the faith placed by some of his contemporaries in experimental philosophy. Casaubon-the son of perhaps the greatest of all detectors of printed fraud, Isaac Casaubon-believed that those who, he claimed, reduced all knowledge to that produced through "natural experiments" ran the risk of losing the skills needed to ward off enthusiastic reading habits. In a learned world inhabited solely by experimental philosophers, there would be no techniques left to discriminate between true "Oracles" and "abominable forgeries," and to ward off the imaginative effects of the latter. Casaubon defended the legitimacy of the scholar in the face of such a threat. The classical learning that suggested Homer's debt to Scripture, for example, thereby confirmed the truth of the Old Testamentsomething profoundly necessary "in this visible sad increase of Atheism every where." In contrast, Casaubon charged that in their naIvete experimental philosophers even questioned "whether those works, generally ascribed to Aristotle, were, or are his indeed?" Should this perilous blend of credulity and skepticism hold sway, and people be "made incapable to uphold their faith" by an erosion of the scholarly skills needed to establish or contest

textual credit, then a "new Religion" would be the inevitable consequence. Instead of their present damaging labors, then, Casaubon suggested that the Royal Society appoint a committee to try the techniques in a book such as Porta's Natural Magick, "that so we might know what men may certainly trust to." 100 Casaubon, like More, exploited his own vivid experiences of reading books to expose enthusiasm. Unlike More, however, Casaubon recalled, not a dream derived from a book, but a direct and industrious confrontation with a book. He described an encounter with a work on Etruscan antiquities which he had come across in a Stationer's shop in London (fig. 6.10). Helped, no doubt, by the bookseller, Casaubon had found its engravings so impressive that he had all but lost control of his body: "the first sight of the book did so ravish me," he affirmed, "that I scarce knew where I was, or what I did." Had he left things at that, the result might have been similar to

the experiences of More and Rogers. Instead, buying the volume, Casaubon began to read it as he embarked on a boat for Gravesend. Before long he had realized his mistake. "The truth is, when once the heat or violence of my expectation (which did almost transport me) was once over," he recalled, "I began to wonder at my self." Every line of the work was fraudulent. But the point was that many other readers did credit it-even to the extent of voyaging to Italy to see the monuments it purported to represent. This convincingly demonstrated how "prone" readers were not only to "entertain an imposture," but to resist its overthrow thereafter. The question this raised was enormously consequential. "What wonder then," Casaubon asked, "if Christianism was so soon turned into Mahometism," when so limited was the dedication of readers "to discover the impostures of pretended Enthusiasts?" The implication of his experience when confronting this forgery was, then, both clear and immense. "Had these Antiquities been received generally, as a true piece," Casaubon warned, "halfthe world would have been Conjurers, and Enthusiasts by this time." 101 Casaubon, More, and others thus used accounts of the effects of reading-accounts based in knowledge of the passions-to characterize and attack false claims to knowledge under the label of enthusiasm. Enthusiasts, they charged, were those who did not properly habituate their reading and their passions. Knowledge, civility, and the physiology of reading intersected here, as they put ideas of the nature and effects of reading to work in the most controversial of circumstances, to discriminate true knowledge from error, and safe veneration from rebellious sectarianism. In general terms, the view was widely shared. As the greatest of all anatomists, William Harvey, had put it, those who read a book and did not "by the aid of their own Senses, abstract true representations of the things themselves (comprehended in the authors expressions)" would apprehend not "true Ideas" but "deceitful Idols, & Phantasms." As a result, Harvey concluded, "they frame

For a slightly later example, compare also [Trenchard], Natural History ofSuperstition, 8 -9, 28, on the effects of the "Forgeries of the Papists, and the Frauds and Follies of some who call themselves Protestants." Such falsities could not have enjoyed so great a success, Trenchard felt, "unless something in our Constitutions made us easily to be susceptible of wrong Impressions." So he felt that "it is incumbent upon us, first of all to examine into the frame and constitution of our own Bodies." Trenchard described from this how "a poor Enthusiast with his Brains intoxicated with reading the Revelations" could seem to make "a lucky discovery that the last Day is at hand."

DISPASSIONATE KNOWLEDGE: IMAGES, CREDIT, AND EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY

Harvey was by this time revered by a certain group of men as providing something that they, at least, "counted science." The life of the early Royal Society will be introduced in chapter 7. Its "experimental" philosophy was designed partly to overcome the problem of knowledge that was thought to have fostered the turmoil of the Great Rebellion. At the forefront of this effort stood the victim of passionate reading already introduced, Robert Boyle. 103 Many sources could be used to illustrate the Society's involvement with issues of knowledge and the passions, not least Boyle's own writings. However, by common consent the most impressive single document produced during the first decade of its existence was Robert Hooke's Micrographia. It is therefore appropriate to concentrate on this work. Moreover, while the spectacular engravings for which it has been remembered were indeed unprecedented, contemporaries also recognized in the volume a prescriptive model for the practice of natural philosophy itself, and therefore for the safe and reliable attainment of knowledge. 104 If the Royal Society had an answer to Casaubon's arguments, it was to be found here. Hooke began by expressing concerns similar to those of Casaubon and More. He pronounced it no wonder that existing knowledge was imperfect, since "the forces ofour own minds conspire to betray us." His book was dedicated to circumventing this problem, "by rectifying the operations of the Sense, the Memory, and Reason." Hooke was thus proposing nothing less than a "universal cute of the Mind." He aimed to achieve this cure by using instruments (fig. 6.11). He believed that the senses could give false information for two reasons. They might be disproportionate to the objects of interest and thus unable to perceive them at all (as was the case, for example, with atoms); or they might err in their perception of those things that they could perceive. As a result, even the most "solid" notions of philosophers were "rather expressions of our own misguided apprehensions then of the true nature of the things themselves." The remedy had to reach to the essential cause of the problem. For Hooke this meant "the adding of artificial Organs to the natural." If the operation of perception could thereby be reguHarvey, Anatomical Exercitations, sig. [lJIrJ. Schaffer, "Godly Men and Mechanical Philosophers." 104.

lated, then the reformation ofknowledge at which he professed to aim might be achieved. Reliance on the "strength of Imagination" would be replaced simply by "a sincere Hand, and afaithful Eye." The "Science of Nature" had been too long "only a work of the Brain and Fancy," Hooke proclaimed, and it was time for his artificial organs to rectify them. If his approach proved fruitful, it might even be possible to recapture the original "unpassionate" knowledge that had existed before the Fall. Meric Casaubon found such aspirations incredible. Indeed, so determined was he to repudiate them that he risked breaking the prime convention ofcivil conversation by flatly denying the truth ofa recounted incident. He questioned the power of experimental philosophy to "moralize men" by recalling a story given by Gassendi in his biography of Peiresc. According to Gassendi's version, Peiresc had enclosed a louse and a fly together under a microscope and observed the deleterious physical effects of the consequent passions excited in the louse. By seeing how damaging excess passions could be, the story went, Peiresc had "profited more to rule his passions in the rest of his life, then he had done by anything he had heard, or read before." Casaubon flatly refused to believe it. Peiresc could not possibly have been influenced more by cwo insects than by the countless writings of philosophers on the passions, which had included extensive accounts of their physiological effects. Reading, not experiment, had the potential to calm one's passions. Casaubon referred in particular to the reading of histories, which

could even cure physical diseases: at least two monarchs had been cured after all medical advice had proved fruitless by reading Livy and Quintus Curtius (Boyle's own favorite). He remained flatly unconvinced "what use can be made, . . . in point of life and manners, of a microscope." And in the meantime, Casaubon insisted, "I have not faith enough to beleeve Gassendus in this." 105 Hooke preempted such denials. Imitating classical conventions, Micrographia began as if it were a work of geometry. Instead of a mathematical point, though - the classic starting element of that science-Hooke began with its physical equivalent, the tip of a pin. Under his microscope this sharpest of material points was revealed to be blunt and pitted. Natural points such as an insect's sting displayed no such imperfections, and Hooke took this to be powerful evidence of a Creator. The argument proved persuasive, and was frequently repeated. lOG But Hooke then turned the microscope onto "a point commonly so call'd": "that is, the mark of a full stop, or period" (fig. 6.12). Through the microscope, any such character, printed

or written-and Hooke examined "multitudes" of each-appeared "like smutty daubings on a matt or uneven floor [made] with a blunt extinguisht brand or stick's end." Thanks to a combination of irregularity of type, uneven cloth-based paper, and rough use of ink, the result resembled nothing so much as "a great splatch of London dirt." All letters, Hooke reported, were like this, so that seeing them as letters was not simple. The microscope revealed some much-vaunted tiny writing as barely readable without "a good [antsy well preposest to help one through," and in fact a good fancy was needed for all reading. Since the "Imaginations" we had of objects were not decided by "the Nature of the things themselves" so much as by "the peculiar Organs, by which they are made sensible to the Understanding," different organs would have produced different perceptions. Hooke had himself been able to read letters in what would otherwise be reckoned darkness, thanks to one of his artificial organs contrived from "an ordinary double Convex Spherical Lens." The postlapsarian disproportion of the senses to nature, and their alliance with the passions and imagination, were both necessary and precisely sufficient to allow human beings to read. 107 The variations of perception obviously had serious consequences for knowledge: in the brain, the understanding was "apt to be sway'd to this or that hand, according as it is more affected ·or prest by this or that Instance." Hooke now pointed out a still greater implication of the corporeality of human beings. There existed fundamental causes of prejudice particular to individuals, he maintained, by virtue of "every Man's own peculiar Structure." Every philosopher was born to "a Constitution of Body and Mind, that does more or less dispose him to this or that kind of Imagination or Phant'sy of things." This affected the sort of philosophy he produced: "some kind of Constitutions of Body does more incline a Man to Contemplation, and Speculation, another to Operation, Examination, and making Experiments." 108 The history of natural philosophy demonstrated as much. Previous philosophers, Hooke indicated, had become "habituated" against "any thing that offered it self as a Novelty or New Discovery," and as a result they had embraced dogmatism-the Royal Society's professed antithesis, and to many a sure sign of enthusiasm. Hooke could even provide real examples to

suggested at this juncture as a way of calibrating the quality of lenses when too far apart for direct comparison: Bonelli and Van Heiden, "Divini and Campani," 13. Thus Molyneux (after Flamsteed) suggested that the best way to test an object glass was to put it in a telescope tube, fit an eyepiece, and look through it at the distant title page of a large book, "wherein there are generally Letters printed of divers Magnitudes." Cassini apparently used this method in the French royal observatory, fixing his title page a quarter of a mile away on a steeple window. Molyneux, Dioptrica Nova, 223. 108.

prove the point, relating some of the most eminent schools of philosophy to the passions and physiology of their founders:
Just as a Man that is troubled with the Jaundice, supposes all things to be Yellow, and all things he eats, till otherwise prevented, serve to augment his Choler, by being chang'd into it: Or a melancholy Person, that thinks he meets with nothing but frightful Apparitions, does convert all things he either sees or hears into dreadful Representations, and makes use of them to strengthen his Phant'sy, and fill it fuller of such uneasy Apprehensions, so is it in Constitutions of Mind as to Philosophy. Thus Aristotle's Physick is very much influenced by his Logick: Des Cartes Philosophy savours much of his Opticks: Vtm Helmonts, and the rest of the Chymists of their Chimical Operations: Gilberts of the Loadstone: Pythagoras's and Jordanus Brunus's, Kepler's, &c. ofArithmetick and Harmony of Numbers. The Philosophy, of some Divines, is intermingled with Divinity; of others with Spirits and immaterial Agents: Astrologers endeavour to bring all things under the Power and Influence of Celestial Bodies, and would have them the chief Efficients of the World, and indeed every one according to the things he most fancies naturally, ... endeavours to make all things he meets with, agreeable or subservient thereto. 109

If Hooke was right, then there was no way, even in principle, to produce true knowledge on one's own. The history of natural philosophy was a catalogue of demonstrations of that fact. I 10 Hooke did maintain, however, that the best "Remedy" for this was selfstudy. The philosopher must "find out of what Constitution ones self is, and to what one is either naturally or accidentally most inclin'd to believe." Then one must "accustom ones self" to "a quite contrary Supposal or Practice." It was the standard tactic, as we have seen, for remedying the passions. According to Hooke, education, breeding, and social background likewise served to "sway" the affections of the individual. He especially stressed the importance of education, which, being imbibed while young, could exercise "a kind of Soveraignty" over the understanding. l l l During schooling, Hooke opined, "the Reason of a Man is very easily impos'd on by Discourse," whether that of a tutor or that of a persuasive book. The best remedy, again, was to concentrate on imagining a directly contrary idea to the one proposed, or, if the tutor were particularly liked, to imagine a speaker against whom one held a grudge. Alternatively, one could "accustom

433

the Mind to an Equilibrium or Indifferency." Yet again, this is familiar as a major tactic for counteracting the passions. But such countermeasures could only mitigate the effects of the passions; they could not eliminate them altogether. Since humans were intrinsically passionate, knowledge must be produced collectively. This was, of course, exemplified by the practice of the Royal Society. To a substantial degree, the Society's great virtue was that in creating a disciplined, polite, and above all collective judgment it went as far as humanly possible to eliminate passionate error. Its reading, writing, and printing practices were a core element in this scheme. Hooke's recommendation, since it valued social processes of legitimation so highly, thus necessarily brought him back to the issue of the proper recording and transmission of knowledge. During his four decades at the Society, Hooke returned repeatedly to the problems associated with reading and writing experimental knowledge. Experiments must be "registered" as soon as they had been conducted, he insisted, in as much incidental detail as possible. They should be written down on "a very fine piece of Paper" and entered in a large book called a "Repository." Just as the quality of the lens in a microscope was allimportant, moreover, so was the visual layout of this register. Its contents must be "ranged in the best and most Natural Order" so as to be "manifest to the Eye." Throughout, everything must be expressed in as few words as possible, perhaps even in shorthand, so as to be "the more obvious, and ... thereby the less disturb the Mind in its Inquiry." It was best to write in different inks, with consistent color coding to aid immediate perception. For it was not the mere fact of registration that Hooke thought so important, but the precise manner in which information was traced out on the page. This involved constructing a visual convention of typography contiguous with the conventions of engraved images that were so prominent a part of his Micrographia. Only if recorded in a correct manner, pictorially and typographically, could experimental matters of fact help in his project to "rectify the Mind." 112 The pictorial aspect of this enterprise deserves particular emphasis. Micrographia itself was justly renowned for its innovative use of images, of course. But in Hooke's broader schemes, typography effectively fused into illustration, as the layout and impression (in both senses) of the page conditioned the knowledge a reader took from it. Printed letters were, after all,

A possible inspiration for Hooke's scheme lay in the diverse systems still being proposed for commonplacing: see esp. Moss, Printed Commonplace-Books, 153, 226-30; Blair, "Humanist Methods in natural Philosophy"; Blair, Theater ofNature, 49-81, 166-79.

CHAPTER SIX

images of a sort, and this was how the imagination recognized them. His friend Joseph Moxon realized this. He exemplified it in his call for characters to be crafted along Vitruvian lines. 1l3 Exactly analogous problems of credit therefore attended engravings and woodcuts as were created by the printing of texts. And this was a conclusion applicable in general, not just in Hooke's own context. Corporeality, credit, and commerce were all implicated in the proper use of images. Were images to be trusted as truthful representations of the world? On what basis? 114 The issue was perhaps especially pertinent in a Protestant realm avowing emancipation from the imaginative manipulation allegedly facilitated by Catholic iconography and emblems. 115 Similar interpretative strategies to those deployed around texts were therefore called for in approaching images, including the investigation of personnel, places, and technologies associated with their production and distribution. Willughby's Historia Piscium, the natural history of fish that almost proved the Royal Society's undoing in the 1680s, was one example; the Atlas Gelestis of John Flamsteed, treated in chapter 8, was another. Both testified to the problems of funding, making, and believing engraved images of natural bodies. 116 Evelyn's Sculptura was partly intended as an answer to such questions. By enabling virtuosi to understand the engraving process, it aspired to help them rid pictorial representations of"Envy, and imposture." When even this book was challenged by a commercial engraver, as chapter 7 shows, the Society responded by moving to develop its own machineries of publication. A sizable community of practitioners existed that could be called upon to generate reproducible images of all kinds. As with the Stationers-but with less formality-this community had developed its own conventions ofcommerce and civility. Like the Stationers, too, these conventions repeatedly clashed with the concerns of men and women wishing to become authors. The engravers had their own patentees, monopolists, and, of course, pirates.

Willughby's book is a particularly interesting case, remarkable for its participants' extensive reflections on the processes of collection, recording, negotiation, and imprinting involved in making trustworthy images. Those processes may be followed by the modern historian, since Willughby's collections of pictures drawn from his European travels, along with comments by Ray (the editor) and others, and proof sheets in various stages of correction, are stored at NUL Ms. MiLM25. These provide what is perhaps a unique opportunity to trace in detail the construction of standard images of creatures from a variety of sources. I hope to examine them in detail in future work.

They had their own notions of propriety, just as flexible and controversial as those of the Stationers' "copy." Exasperated complainants discovered that plates could be amended to an indeterminate degree by such workers, so that in a realm of unauthorized reproduction the artist bade "farewel to Accuracy, Expression, [and] Invention." The unlucky ones ended up yoked to the piracy mill themselves, becoming "no better than the Lowest of Robbers." Thus the whole enterprise seemed dominated by "the Tyranny Frauds & Piracies of Monopolising Dealers" (fig. 6.13). It was a situation replete

43 6

CHAPTER SIX

with disturbing implications-for modern historians as well as contemporary readers, both being forced to rely on images the very creation of which cast doubt on their credit. ll7 As with texts, the credibility of pictorial reproductions could best be secured by manifesting clear control over every aspect of the reproductive process. Alexander Pitfield implied as much when he remarked that the images of dissections performed at the Academie des Sciences that he reproduced in 1688 "were not graved, till all those which were present at the Dissections found that they were wholly conformable to what they had seen." Novel techniques had to be developed for such a strategy to succeed, for, as Pitfield said, "in this the importance is not so much to represent well what is seen, as to see well what should be represented." Every author who saw an intricately designed draft for a frontispiece subjected to the caprice of an unlearned engraver knew as much. In the Royal Society, Pitfield and others drew upon the talented yet unsung Richard Waller. A protege of Hooke, Waller uniquely combined craft skill with the civility of a Society fellow. The most spectacular instance, however, was that of the Danzig astronomer Johannes Hevelius. Van Helden and Winkler show how Hevelius worked to create a "visual language" for his astronomy. An essential part of his enterprise was the establishment of credit in his engravings for users who might reside half a continent away. Hevelius tried to achieve this end by providing a complete, circumstantial account of their making. He covered the entire transit ofan observation from telescope to printed page, including such arcane subjects as lens grinding and the different rates of shrinkage in breadth and height of damp paper as it dried. Hevelius himself may not actually have done any engraving or printing, although it is quite possible that he did (his printer certainly observed the stars with him). But he did pay for and control these processes, and the credit of the engraver and
II7. Or, worse, the images might not exist at all. Pictorial representations oflabor, retailing, and similar activities (and of printing and bookselling in particular) were far more likely to be made in Continental Europe than in London; that is why those used in chapter 2 often display French, Dutch, or German scenes. It is hard to say exactly why, although an explanation will clearly rest on the different criteria by which the engraving and publishing communities of these different regions reached their creative decisions-criteria involving representations of skill, economy, credibility, and audience. In fact, the images used above were generally meant to be normative as well as representative. They have been used for this reason, as well as because they are the most accurate images of printing houses and bookshops available to us. Pictures ofexperiments being done are another, even more striking, example: these do not seem to have been published anywhere. See Case ofDesigners, Engravers, Etchers for a polemic against the London print trade and its corruption by monopolists and pirates, and below, pp. 6t5 - 6, for the consequences of alleged piracy in the case ofJohn Flamsteed's star charts.

printer was therefore to be "included in" his own. His images of the stars were stamped with the certificates "Observator sculpsit" (in Cometographia) or "Autor sculpsit" (in Selenographia).l18 These signaled that he was staking his reputation on a quite extraordinary claim to veracity. In Hevelius's books, the page was to be accounted a direct representation of the heavens. It was, however, possible to question Hevelius's images. Flamsteed referred to one instance. In his Mercurius in Sole Visus, Hevelius had displayed an engraving of the transit of Mercury across the Sun in 1661 that, he claimed, was of just this order of veracity. He had produced the seven recorded positions by marking them with a pin on a single sheet of paper onto which he had projected the face of the Sun (fig. 6.14). But Oldenburg communicated to him doubts about this image raised by Thomas Streete, who had observed the same transit in London with Huygens. Streete pointed out that the angle of Mercury's path displayed by Hevelius seemed to contradict Streete's own calculations based on accepted observations of the planet's angle to the ecliptic (fig. 6.15). Perhaps Hevelius had in fact constructed the printed picture not directly from observation, but by combining other sheets on which observed positions had been marked. Hevelius's first response was to insist again upon the observational veracity of the figure and to remark that the angle of Mercury's orbit could be obtained "mechanically" by constructions from his engraving (fig. 6.16). This failed to satisfy Streete, who now proposed further doubts about the viability of Hevelius's technique for obtaining truthful numbers. The necessary movement of the sheet of paper between each observation, he argued, meant that important angles must vary between each of the seven traces. Hevelius now saw that Streete was in effect directly questioning the truth of his account of the marking of these positions. He reaffirmed that he had noted them on the same sheet. He had appointed the vertical point of the Sun's limb, then referred the paper to that vertical in making each observation. This, he maintained, was a more direct and truthful method that any based on calculated figures. Since it relied on no prior information, it was an instantiation of the principle of nullius in verba. Yet, in true Royal Society tradition, he also cited witnesses to confirm that he had indeed acted as he said, and that the recorded observations accorded to those engraved in the book. This effectively ended the mild controversy, since the stakes of continued questioning were too high. As Flamsteed remarked, Streete's insinuation of a

Flamsteed himself found this to his cost, as chapter 8 shows. Meanwhile, Hooke took the provisions of his own recipe very seriously (fig. 6.17). He emphasized just these factors, for example, in championing projects for publication. Moses Pitt's English Atlas, which he strongly supported, was thus designed to present "a plaine simple deer and uncompounded Representation of the Object to the Sense," to "more easily imprint that idea the Deeper in the memory, which is the Principall use of such a work." 120 That he maintained this view so strongly should hardly be surprising, since Hooke based it on principles of mind and body that he felt to be of universal applicability.

cated to the production of polyglot bibles, in which "the several Languages shall be printed in several Columns, whereby they may all be presented to the Readers view at once," to synoptic bibliographical guides from Gesner's onward, and to the affinity tables and similar devices deployed by chemical writers of the next century. All involved prolonged, dedicated, and active reflection on the importance of mise en page for the communication, reception, and practice of knowledge. 121 As Hooke himself declared in a lecture on geometry, given these principles it was essential to follow his mechanisms for "furnishing the Mind with the true grounds of Knowledge." They were not necessary just for experimental philosophy, however. All knowledge must be communicated in such a fashion, or else it could not truly be accounted knowledge. "We see it necessary, and practised in many other things where a good habit is to be acquired." As such, it was clearly essential in "Reading ... , and most other Manual Operations." 122
CONCLUSION

This chapter has utilized contemporary accounts of anatomy, the passions, philosophical method, and perception, in order to encourage a widening of the terms in which we view the practices and representations of reading in early modern England. The fact that uses of this material were remarkably diverse in the period, so that the treatment offered here has at times pursued them away from a narrow concentration on reading itself and into issues of education, knowledge, gender, religious faith, and politics, only reinforces its salience. Such a diversity ofapplication underscores the importance that historians should attach to the history of reading as both skill and representation. John Dryden suggested another use that underscores the point. Dryden insisted upon the importance of historiography because "it informs the understanding by the memory." Since mankind was "the same in all ages," and "agitated by the same passions," nothing could come to pass unless "some Presedent of the like nature has already been produc'd." It was an entirely conventional view, shared by many in Dryden's society. \23 The argument rested on assumptions about the natutal economy of the passions-an economy that contemporaries assumed to be universal and sempiternal.

perhaps the most influential introduction to the reading of history, Degory Wheare thus urged that historicalliterarure imprinted images of characters on the mind, and thereby encouraged their emulation. "By a kind of WaxImages," Wheare told srudents, the rhetorical presentation ofpast characters could "help, excite and irritate our cold and languishing Memories." 124 Wheare thus defined history itself as a "Register and Explication of particular affairs, undertaken to the end that the memory of them may be preserved, and so Universals may be the more evidently confirm'd, by which we may be instructed how to live well and Happily." 125 This was very much the same kind of representation as that which informed Hooke's deployment of his own "register" at the Royal Society. This chapter began by asking what early modern men and women thought acrually happened when they read. They saw letters on a page through eyes that resembled the device known as the camera obscura, which conveyed images, through the body's animal spirits, onto the brain's semus communis. There imaginative and perceprual images combined, and animal spirits mingled and departed to drive the body's responses to both. The chapter traced the paths of these spirits along the channels increasingly discerned by anatomists, and demonstrated that their role was such that reading necessarily took place through a complex of what contemporaries called "passions." They knew a great deal about these entities, and were able to account for a wide variety of beliefs and actions in terms of their passionate states. Passions could be generated either by sensations or by internal bodily events. The latter was certainly the case during diseases, and physicians possessed recognized remedies for such conditions. More, Sedgwick, Hickes, and Smith capitalized on their experiences when they juxtaposed enthusiastic "visions" with passionate "vapours." This meant that reading partook of a problem of knowledge that was one of the most intractable to face early modern society. The discussion showed the necessity for an English subject of restraining his or her passions. On success in this effort depended the status of the individual as a reliable investigator and relater of truth. This applied in all spheres, but the chapter particularly stressed the importance of the passions in accounting for what hostile contemporaries called "enthusiasm." In the 1640s, especially, radical nonconformists, convinced of what they called their experimental faith, claimed direct insights from God. For the women among them, this conviction facilitated their pioneering of forms of authorship not seen before in England. But most authorities were antagonistic. What distinguished sec124.

tarian "schism" from "necessary separation" (such as that of Canterbury from Rome), John Hales thought, was that the former rested on "passion or distemper." 126 This was a very widely held view indeed. Religious "enthusiasts" were thus classifiable in terms of their inability or unwillingness to restrain their passions in the context of their reading. Henry More and Meric Casaubon took great pains to specify the precise nature of their opponents' errors, and did so by recounting their own most striking reading experiences. Both elided typography and images in their tales. More stressed the importance of the imagination in creating apparent visions from visually striking pages. Casaubon agreed, but went further in urging the profound danger of abandoning the labor of critical, skeptical reading in a world of forgeries. Its neglect of the skills needed for this effort was why Casaubon opposed the program of the Royal Society. 127 That program-the establishment and promotion of experimental natural philosophy-is the subject of the following chapter.

Such complaints should, however, be compared to the conduct of people such as Flamsteed, who refused to send a list of errata in his Doctrine ofthe Sphere to Molyneux because the presence of unknown errors would force the reader to work through-and hence properly understand-the mathematical argument of the book. Molyneux responded by declaring that his weakness in mathematics was such that unless Flamsteed became more forthcoming, he would cease to read it altogether: he "should read with fear and distrust, and that is to read in Pain and not in Pleasure."

The  History  of  Communication  Media
Friedrich  Kittler

Introduction
What  follows  is  on  attempt  to  discuss  the  history  of  communication  technologies  -  as  far  as  this is  humanly  possible  -  in  general  terms.  The  objective  is  ultimately  the  outline  of  a  scientific history  of  the  media  -  an  outline  for  the  simple  reason  that  media  sciences  is  a  new  field  of research  which  would  not  exist  had  it  not  been  for  the  triumphal  advance  of  modern  information technologies.  This  is  why  such  a  history  comes  up  against  methodological  and  practical problems. One  practical  problem  is  that  communications  technologies  themselves  are  documented  to  a far  lesser  extent  or  are  far  less  accessible  than  their  contents  vide  the  manner  in  which  the intelligence  services  have  remained,  despite  their  frequently  decisive  role  in  wars  (to  quote  the last  head  of  the  Wehrmacht  intelligence  service,  "the  Cinderella  of  military-historical  research"  1 Then  there  is  the  methodological  problem  posed  by  the  conundrum  of  whether  the  now  so  self- evident  term  "communication"  can  properly  be  used  in  connection  with  times  and  locations which  manifestly  were  characterised  by  other  terminology  (drawn  from  mythology  or  religion).  At any  rate  its  enthronement  in  philosophy  was  based  in  John  Locke's  "Essay  on  Human Understanding"  on  the  scarcely  generalisable  assumption  that  communication  means  the rendering  into  speech  of  perceived  ideas  and  consequently  the  linking  of  isolated  individuals through  "bonds  of  language".2  The  only  trouble  is  that  philosophy  omits  to  enquire  how,  without language,  people  are  supposed  to  have  arrived  at  their  ideas  and  conceptions  in  the  first  place. Liberation  from  this  unfathomable  confusion  came  only  with  a  technical  concept  of  information which,  since  Shannon's  "Mathematical  Theory  of  Communication",  avoids  any  reference  to ideas  or  meanings  and  thus  to  people. Information  systems  in  the  narrowest  sense  of  the  word  are,  it  is  true,  optimised  in  terms  of  the storage,  processing  and  transmission  of  messages.  Communication  systems  on  the  other  hand because  in  addition  to  messages  they  also  control  the  traffic  of  persons  and  goods  3  comprise  all kinds  of  media  (in  McLuhan's  analysis)  from  road  systems  to  language.4  There  is  nonetheless good  reason  to  analyse  communication  systems  in  the  same  way  as  information  systems. Ultimately,  communication  too  depends  on  control  signals,  the  more  so  the  more  complex  its working;  even  the  triad  of  "things  communicated"  -  information,  persons,  goods  -  can  be reformulated  in  terms  of  information  theory: Firstly,  messages  are  essentially  commands  to  which  persons  are  expected  to react  [this  definition  in  the  original  German  is  based  on  the  etymology  of  the German  word  "Nachrichten"  -  Tr.]. Secondly,  as  systems  theory  teaches,  persons  are  not  objects  but  addresses

which  "make  possible  the  assessment  of  further  communications".5 Thirdly,  as  ethnology  since  Mauss  and  Levi-Strauss  has  taught,  goods represent  data  in  an  order  of  exchange  between  said  persons. However  if  data  make  possible  the  operation  of  storage,  addresses  that  of  transmission  and commands  that  of  data  processing,  then  every  communication  system,  as  the  alliance  of  these three  operations,  is  an  information  system.  It  depends  solely  on  whether  the  three  operations  are implemented  in  physical  reality  to  what  extent  such  a  system  becomes  an  independent communication  technology.  In  other  words  the  history  of  these  technologies  comes  to  an  end when  machines  not  only  handle  the  transmission  of  addresses  and  data  storage,  but  are  also able,  via  mathematical  algorithms,  to  control  the  processing  of  commands.  It  is  thus  no coincidence  that  not  until  the  start  of  the  computer  age,  that  is,  when  all  operations  of communication  systems  had  been  mechanised,  was  Shannon  able  to  describe  a  formal  model of  information.  This  model  comprises,  as  we  know,  five  connected  stages  6: Firstly  there  is  an  information  source  which  selects  one  message  per  unit  of time  from  the  either  enumerable-discrete  or  innumerable-continuous  quantity  of possible  messages. Secondly  this  source  supplies  one  or  more  transmitters  which  process  the message  via  suitable  coding  into  a  technical  signal  (something  which  is  quite impossible  in  the  discrete  case  without  intermediate  data  storage). Thirdly  these  transmitters  feed  a  channel  which  safeguards  the  transmission  of the  signal  in  space  and/or  time  from  physical  noise  and/or  hostile  interference. Fourthly  these  channels  lead  to  one  or  more  receivers  which  reconstitute  the message  from  the  signal  by  subjecting  it  to  a  decoding  algorithm  inverse  to  that of  the  transmitter,  so  that  finally, Fifthly,  the  retranslated  message  arrives  at  the  address  of  an  information  drain.7 This  elegant  model,  however,  cannot  simply  be  applied  to  the  factual  history  of  communication technology,  not  least  because  it  lays  no  claim  whatever  to  historicity.  Instead  of  simply  accepting Shannon's  five  black  boxes,  as  has  become  customary  in  linguistics  and  the  humanities  too,  it seems  more  important  and  more  rewarding  to  trace  back  through  history  how  their  evolution must  have  proceeded  in  the  first  place.  Taking  Luhmann's  premise  that  communication technologies  provide  a  "first-rate  demarcation  of  epochs  magnetising  all  else"  8,  it  is  reasonable to  conclude  that  the  historical  transition  from  orality  to  the  written  word  equated  to  a  decoupling of  interaction  and  communication,  and  the  transition  from  writing  to  the  technical  media  indeed  to a  decoupling  of  communication  and  information.  What  we  have  here,  therefore,  is  a  process  of evolution  which  has  come  to  a  conclusion  only  in  the  theory  and  practice  of  an  information  which corresponds  to  the  exact  opposite  of  the  energetic  concept  of  entropy.9 This  evolutionary  process  gives  us  the  possibility  of  dividing  the  history  of  communication media  into  two  main  blocks.  The  first  block  deals  with  the  history  of  writing  and  itself  divides  into a  section  on  scripts  and  one  on  printing.  The  second  block  on  technical  media  will  take  us  from the  basic  invention  of  telegraphy  via  the  analog  media  to,  finally,  the  digital  medium  of  the computer.

A.  Writing
1.  Script The  history  of  the  literate  cultures,  whose  "medium"  customarily  also  divides  history  from prehistory  10,  is  determined  by  two  series  of  variables.  The  first  series  stands  in  relation  to  what philosophy  since  the  Stoics  has  recognised,  or  failed  to  recognise,  as  a  reference:  To  the  extent that  the  content  of  a  medium  is  always  another  medium  11  and  that  of  writing  (even  for  Aristotle 12)  is  speech,  scripts  can  be  classified  according  to  whether  they  process  everyday  languages into  pictographs  or  syllabic  or  phonemic  signs.13  However  to  the  extent  that  the  medium  of writing,  probably  for  the  first  time,  also  couples  storage  and  transmission,  inscription  and  post, then  physical  variables  relating  to  writing  implements  and  writing  surface  decide  as  to  the  space and  time  frame  of  the  communication.  These  variables  dictate  the  time  needed  for  transmitting and  receiving,  the  permanence  or  erasability  of  what  is  written  and,  not  least,  whether  the information  is  transportable  or  not. The  first  series  of  variables  controls  developments  between  speech  and  writing:  degrees  of memory  performance,  degrees  of  grammatical  analysability,  the  possibilities  of  coupling  speech with  other  media.  As  an  independent  field  of  anthropological  media  research  it  can,  for  our purposes,  be  left  to  one  side. The  second  series  of  variables  has  received  considerably  less  attention,  possibly  because  it  is so  material  in  nature.  And  yet  it  is  such  simple  things  as  writing  implements  and  writing  surfaces that  determine  the  gain  in  power  in  which  the  introduction  of  scripts  always  results.  If  priests were  interested  in  the  storage  of  addresses,  that  is,  of  gods  or  the  dead,  for  a  maximum  length  of time;  if  merchants  were  interested  in  the  storage  of  goods  over  a  maximum  length  of  time  and  in the  transportation  of  goods  over  maximum  distances  and  finally  warriors  in  the  transmission  of commands  over  maximum  distances  in  the  shortest  possible  time,  then  the  oldest  scripts  which were  produced  some  3000  years  BC  in  Sumeria  and  Egypt  had  economic  and  religious functions.  In  warrior  circles  however,  that  which  military  historians  call  the  oral  "stone  age  of  the command  flow"  ended  only  with  Napoleon.14  Apart  from  commands  passed  from  mouth  to  ear there  were  only  the  semiotic  use  of  fire  for  signaling  purposes  and  fast  but  equally  oral messengers,  whose  record  was  probably  held  by  Genghis  Khan.15 The  first  manifestations  of  script  are  of  course  inscriptions  without  a  writing  surface  in  the accepted  sense.  Two-dimensional  rolls  of  seals  or  stamps  in  the  medium  of  clay  enabled  goods to  be  given  addresses  indicating  their  owner  or  their  contents.  Stone  inscriptions  named  the deceased  occupants  of  tombs.16  As  signals  in  the  absence  of  the  source  of  information,  in  other words  through  the  decoupling  of  communication  and  interaction,  inscriptions  opened  up, according  to  Jan  Assmann,  the  possibility  in  principle  of  literature.17 By  contrast  an  administration  of  those  great  river  irrigation  systems  in  which  cities  and  high cultures  blossomed  presupposed  the  transition  from  inscribed  tablets  to  skillfully  crafted  and optimised  transportable  writing  surfaces:  bamboo  and  mulberry  in  China,  unfired  clay  or  clay fired  for  storage  purposes  in  Mesopotamia,  papyrus  as  the  monopoly  of  the  Nile  delta.  Thus  the same  rivers  on  which  the  traffic  of  slave  labour  and  goods  flowed  simultaneously  carried  (on  the basis  of  a  calendar  or  goniometric  mathematics)  the  commands  of  water  allocation  and  the harvesting  of  products.18  The  same  cities  that  translated  the  anthropological  schema  of  head, hand  and  torso  into  the  architectonic  schema  of  palaces,  streets  and  storehouses  19  needed

scripts  for  the  processing  transmission  and  storage  of  their  data.  This  establishment  of  a  unified area  is  reflected  in  the  texts  themselves  as  a  spatialisation  of  speech:  since  its  very  beginnings writing  has  yielded  lists  without  context  which  bear  no  traces  of  oral  or  written  communication networks,  but  for  this  precise  reason  no  longer  have  any  equivalent  in  everyday  situations.20 By  contrast,  outreachings  beyond  the  unified  area  -  the  founding  of  empires  in  other  words  - only  became  possible  when  states  in  both  the  ancient  world  and  the  modern  took  over  control  of the  warrior  messengers  and  additionally,  in  the  ancient  world  since  1200  BC,  after  the  crossing of  two  breeds  of  horse,  made  messengers  and  warriors  mobile.21  In  classical  times,  "There was,"  in  the  immortal  words  of  Herodotus,  "nothing  swifter  on  earth"  than  the  alliance  of  media which,  under  the  Achaemenides,  combined  Persia's  Royal  Way  with  a  mounted  staging messenger  service  to  carry  "urgent  messages  at  a  fast  trot,  in  the  face  of  all  natural  adversities, from  rider  to  rider,  from  stage  to  stage.22  Angareion,  the  Persian  name  of  this  military  mail,  is  the root  of  the  Greek  word  for  messenger  and  consequently  of  all  Christian  angels. The  Greek  polis  had  but  one  script  to  set  against  a  communications  empire  such  as  the Persian,  but  in  contrast  to  oriental  bureaucracies  it  was  entirely  susceptible  *of  orality.  Firstly  the Greek  alphabet  (from  Indo-European  necessities  and  because  it  developed  in  the  course  of commercial  and  translation  intercourse  with  semitic  consonant  scripts)  turned  redundant consonants  into  vowels,  thus  performing  the  first  total  analysis  of  a  spoken  language  -  and  in principle  of  all  such.23  The  fact  that  vowel  signs  for  the  first  time  encoded  prosodic-musical elements  of  speech  permitted  of  a  musical  notation,  and  in  the  Pythagorean  school  for  the simple  reason  that  Greek  letters  also  possessed  numerical  values  24,  a  mathematisation  of music,  to  the  extent  that  this  remained  a  matter  of  abstract  intervals. Secondly,  the  triumphal  progress  of  the  vocalic  alphabet  seems  less  to  be  the  result  of  an overestimated  degree  of  innovation  rather  than  of  the  unambiguity  of  its  phoneme  allocation. This  minimised  the  effort  required  for  literacy  and  thus  transferred  palace  and  temple  secrets  to the  public  domain.25  It  became  possible  for  literature  firstly  to  incorporate  oral  mnemonics  (such as  airs  or  rhapsodies)  and  later  also  prose.26  Athenian  tyrants  founded  the  first  public  library;  the bookworm  Euripides  became  the  "first  great  reader"  among  writers.27 These  ancient  scrolls  got  their  Biblical  name  from  a  papyrus-exporting  city  in  Phoenicia  whose place  was  taken  as  of  5O0  BC  by  the  Nile  delta.  The  Imperium  Romanum  too,  after  the  conquest of  Egypt,  based  its  command  network  -  which  is  what  the  empire  was  -  on  a  combination  of mounted  staging  messengers,  madeup  military  roads  and  easily  transportable  papyrus.  The empire,  in  other  words,  combined  despotic  transmission  mechanisms  with  a  democratic alphabet.  The  cursus  publicus  which  Augustus  set  up,  with  overnight  stations  at  distances  of  40 kilometres  and  staging  posts  at  around  12  kilometres,  exclusively  for  officials  and  legions  28 became,  despite  this,  or  perhaps  precisely  because  of  it,  the  crystallisation  point  for  European towns.  In  combination  with  beacon  telegraphy  at  sensitive  frontiers,  a  state  postal  service,  which was  faster  than  the  fastest  ships  and  was  not  excelled  until  Napoleon,  transmitted  imperial power  as  such:  "Caesarum  est  per  arbem  terrae  litteras  missitare"  29,  as  a  late  Roman  writer  has it  -  "It  is  the  office  of  emperors  to  send  written  commands  across  the  world."  In  comparison  with this  perfect  transmission  medium  for  said  world  and  Caesar's  news-sheet  distribution  in  the  city of  Rome,  data  storage  -  even  if  there  was  an  imperial  officium  sacrae  memoriae  since  Hadrian  - remained  technically  retarded. Papyrus  may  be  light,  but  it  is  fragile  and  impermanent.  It  could  only  be  stored  in  rolls  and  read

with  two  hands.  In  the  opinion  of  Alan  Turing,  the  first  computer  theorist,  "it  must  have  taken some  time  to  look  up  references  in  such  volumes".30  It  was  not  until  the  arrival  of  the  codex  in parchment,  used  first  by  the  library  of  Persimmon  for  circumventing  the  Egyptian  papyrus monopoly,  and  by  Christians  since  140  AD,  that  indexing  by  location,  sheets  and  finally  sides, became  possible.  Books,  which  were  durable,  erasable  (as  in  the  palimpsest)  and  addressable with  special  pages  (indices)  were  worth  their  extra  weight  and  extra  cost.  They  decoupled increasingly  cursory  reading  from  the  laboriousness  and  slowness  of  orality.  When  Bishop Ambrose  of  Milan  (according  to  the  testimony  of  his  best-known  disciple)  read  a  codex  "his  eyes swept  over  the  pages  extracting  the  essence  of  the  meaning  while  he  himself  remained  silent".31 In  the  codex,  the  transportable,  addressable  and  interpretable  scripts  of  former  nomads,  the Jews  and  Arabs,  vanquished  the  immobility  of  statues  and  temples  of  the  gods. The  decline  of  the  cursus  publicus  and  the  Islamic  incorporation  of  Egypt,  which  also  led  to  the destruction  of  the  great  ancient  library,  cut  off  Western  Europe  from  papyrus  imports.  What  was left  was  the  agricultural  product,  parchment,  on  which  monks  were  constrained  to  copy  the censored  Christian  version  of  what  was  contained  on  papyrus,  while  in  the  Byzantine  Empire  the flaw  of  written  commands  from  all  past  emperors  coagulated  into  the  legislation  of  the  Codex. Through  such  bridgings  or  compressions  of  time  a  translatio  studii  was  enabled  to  take  place; but  the  translatio  imperii  presupposed  new  orders  of  distance  and  thus  more  accessible  writing surfaces. In  the  13th  century,  paper,  imported  from  China  via  Baghdad,  arrived  in  Europe,  where  it  was further  developed  by  cities  of  the  linen  trade  and  the  new  windmills  and  watermills  into  rag- paper.  This  writing  surface  was  central  to  the  rise  of  the  universities  which,  with  their incorporated  book-copying  departments  and  postal  networks  broke  the  storage  monopoly  of  the monasteries.  And  at  the  same  time  it  was  central,  in  combination  with  the  Indian  numerical system  imported  via  Arabia,  to  the  rise  of  trading  cities.32  The  important  thing  in  this  context  was not  simply  the  well  known  invention  of  double-entry  bookkeeping  but,  above  all,  a  mathematical notation  which  for  the  first  time  brought  independence  from  the  numerous  workaday  languages. Greeks,  when  adding  two  numbers  together,  had  said  kai,  and  Romans  et;  since  the  15th century  however  we  have  had  plus  and  minus,  as  mute  as  they  are  international,  as  signs  for mathematical  operators. 2.  Printing Gutenberg's  invention  of  printing  using  movable  letters  developed  from  book-spine  stamps which,  in  contrast  to  their  predecessors  in  China  and  Korea,  functioned  both  alphabetically  and (after  the  disappearance  of  ligatures)  discretely,  may  not  have  been  a  revolution  of  the magnitude  of  the  codex  -  but  it  met  the  demand  awakened  by  paper.  As  "the  first  assembly  line in  the  history  of  technology"  33,  printing  potentiated  the  data  processing  capacity  of  books. Because  all  copies  of  an  edition,  in  contrast  to  manual  copies,  had  the  same  texts,  woodcuts  and engravings  in  the  same  places,  they  could  be  accessed  via  unified  and  for  the  first  time alphabetical  indexes.  This  addressing  using  page  numbers,  titles  and,  since  Leibniz, alphabetical  library  catalogues  34,  put  the  communication  system  which  is  science  on  its reference  basis,  while  book  illustrations  free  of  copying  errors  formed  the  basis  of  engineering.35 Not  without  reason  could  Vasari  boast  that  Italy  had  discovered  perspective,  as  enabling  the production  of  technically  accurate  drawings,  in  the  same  year  as  Gutenberg  invented typography.

New  media  do  not  make  old  media  obsolete;  they  assign  them  other  places  in  the  system.  Thus because  printing  now  reproduced  the  rhetorical-musical  performances  at  tournaments  as literature  and  fictions  of  the  authors,  the  physical  techniques  of  these  tournaments  appear (according  to  Gumbrecht's  thesis)  to  have  been  transmuted  into  silent,  measurable  disciplines.36 Equally,  it  was  only  as  a  development  within  typography  that  the  intrinsic  value  of  handwriting emerged,  the  individuality  of  the  hand  taking  the  place  of  seals  on  letters  and  documents  and which  became  the  domain  of  a  state  system  of  post  and  police.  The  first  state  postal  systems  of early  modernity  were,  after  the  fashion  of  the  Roman  imperial  system,  still  reserved  for  military and  diplomatic  networks  and  protected  from  interception  by  a  cryptography  whose  rise  began with  Vieta's  algebraic  encoding  of  alphabetical  and  numerical  signs.37  On  the  other  hand,  the territorial  states,  controlled  extensively  by  post  and  firearms,  opened  up  their  networks  to  a private  traffic  which  they  also  monopolised  through  their  sovereign  right  of  posts.  When commercial  correspondents  were  included  in  the  public  postal  network  after  1600,  newspapers and  journals  came  into  being;  when  the  transport  of  persons  was  also  included  after  1650,  the post-coach  networks  were  established  as  a  scheduled  service.38  However  the  oft-quoted structural  transformation  from  the  aristocratic  to  the  middle-class  publicness,  whose  travels  and letters,  printed  pamphlets  and  newspaper  critiques  are  supposed  to  have  undermined  the  old power  system  of  Europe,  never  took  place.39  Even  without  its  consistent  control  through  secret cabinets  and  print  censorship  the  middle-class  publicness  remained  an  artefact  of  mercantile states,  whose  new  post  office  provided  half  the  budget  and  half  the  war  chest.40  Only  in  the intimacy  of  family  circles  did  the  "addiction  to  reading"  of  the  so-called  public  41  promote  a record  rise  in  national-language  belles-lettres  which  compensated  for  the  "loss  of  sensuality"  42 with  virtual  effects  on  readers'  senses,  thus  presaging  future  media  technologies.43 This  mediatisation  of  the  printed  word  presumably  had  its  basis  in  a  routine  light  reading  which was  no  longer  a  privilege  of  the  elite,  as  in  Saint  Ambrose's  time,  but  which  paved  the  way  for democracy  through  compulsory  schooling  and  general  literacy.  But  precisely  this  effortless reading  triggered  a  new  systemic  problem.  Because,  unlike  parchment  codices,  printed  books are  storage  devices  having  no  possibility  of  erasure,  there  was,  around  1800,  (to  quote  Fichte) "no  branch  of  knowledge  on  which  a  surfeit  of  books  is  not  available".44  As  a  result  literature  and science  had  to  revamp  their  transmission  and  receiving  techniques:  away  from  the  literalness  of quotes  from  the  scholarly  elite,  and  rhetorical  mnemonics,  towards  an  interpretative  approach which  reduced  the  quantity  of  printed  data  to  its  essence,  in  other  words  to  a  smaller  quantity  of data.  The  consequence  for  the  communication  system  that  is  science,  since  Humboldt's  reform, was  lectures  without  textbooks,  seminars  as  exercises  in  interpretation  and  the  rise  at universities  of  a  philosophy  whose  absolute  "spirit"  preserved  only  the  "remembrance"  of  all previous  forms  of  knowledge  and  of  its  own  textbook,  thus  becoming  the  hermeneutic "silhouette"  of  the  totality  of  books.45 In  the  real  world  this  mediatisation  of  writing  amounted  to  its  industrial  revolution.  In  place  of Gutenberg's  enumerable  combinations  came,  in  practical  terms  too,  a  calculus  of  infinites: endless  paper  machines  replaced,  as  of  1800,  the  discrete  formats  and  moulded  sheets;  pulp papers  from  America's  seemingly  inexhaustible  forests,  this  material  basis  of  all  mass  print material  since  1850,  took  the  place  of  rag.  And  finally  the  typewriter  and  have,  since  1880, levelled  out  the  difference  between  writing  and  printing  46,  thus  opening  up  the  floodgates  of modern  literature.47  It  was  Mallarme  who  first  offered  the  solution  of  reducing  literature  to  its lexical  meaning,  the  twenty-six  letters,  and  thus  not  competing  with  other  media  at  all.

B.  Technical  Media
Unlike  writing,  technical  media  do  not  utilise  the  code  of  a  workaday  language.  They  make  use of  physical  processes  which  are  faster  than  human  perception  and  are  only  at  all  susceptible  of formulation  in  the  code  of  modern  mathematics. 1.  Telegraphy  and  Analog  Technology Self-evidently  there  must  always  have  been  technical  media,  because  any  sending  of  signals using  acoustic  or  visual  means  is  in  itself  technical.  However  in  preindustrial  times  channels such  as  smoke  signals  or  fire  telegraphy  which  exploited  the  speed  of  light,  or  bush  telegraphs and  calling  chains  making  use  of  the  speed  of  sound  were  only  subsystems  of  an  everyday language.  The  beacon  signal  from  Troy  to  Mycenae  with  which  Aeschylus  introduces  the  literary genre  of  tragedy  announced  in  one  single  bit  the  fall  of  the  besieged  fortress  although  that depended  on  prior  arrangement.48  On  the  other  hand  it  remains  questionable  whether  a  form  of telegraphy  which  according  to  Polybios  was  capable  of  encoding  the  Greek  alphabet  into  five times  five  light  signals  and  thus  transmitting  random  sets  ever  saw  service.49 Information  rates  which  exceeded  all  performance  limits  of  writing  were  first  achieved  as  a result  of  the  necessity  for  command  flow  in  conscripted  mass  armies  and  wars  waged  with standardised  weaponry.  It  was  one  and  the  same  to  Lakanai,  the  politician  who  presented  the revolutionary  France  of  1793  with  an  elementary  school  system  and  a  literary  copyright  law  who one  year  later  persuaded  the  national  assembly  to  build  optical  telegraphy  lines.  As  the  official reason  for  this  revolution  the  argument  was  pressed  into  service  that,  in  large  nation-states,  only Chappe's  optical  telegraph  could  make  possible  that  democratic  election  process  which Rousseau  had,  as  we  know,  picked  up  from  the  city-state  of  Geneva.  With  Napoleon  however,  a less  public  but  exclusive  use  of  the  optical  telegraph  network  gave  rise  to  a  strategy  which  finalIy released  wars  from  the  stone  age  of  command  flow.  Independently-operating  divisions  were able  to  fight  on  several  fronts  at  the  same  time  because  newly-created  general  staffs  imposed their  cartographic  knowledge  by  telegraph  on  the  actual  ground.50 Telegraphy  thus  separated  literary  publicness  and  military  secrecy  at  the  same  historic moment,  since  publicness  was  transferred  from  elites  to  entire  populations.  A  new  elite  of engineering  schools  and  general  staffs  finally  discovered  in  the  1809  war  their  new,  to  all  intents and  purposes,  secret  medium  of  electricity.  With  the  move  of  telegraphy  from  optics  to  direct current,  not  only  did  the  human  and  therefore  unreliable,  relay  stations  disappear,  but  also Claude  Chappe's  grand  total  of  98  signs.  The  Morse  code  with  its  dots  and  dashes  and  pauses put  an  economy  of  signs  into  practice  which  Leibniz  had  previously  come  up  with  in  expressly typographical  theory  in  the  form  of  his  binary  code.51  The  electric  telegraph,  optimised  on  the basis  of  letter  frequency  and  charged  by  the  number  of  words,  was  the  first  step  on  the  road  to information  technology. In  terms  of  organisation  and  technology  too,  telegraphy  had  world-wide  repercussions.  For absolutely  the  first  time,  information  was  decoupled,  in  the  form  of  a  massless  flow  of electromagnetic  waves,  from  communication.  Remote  telegraphic  control  via  landline  made possible  a  systematic  railway  network.52  Railways  made  possible  an  accelerated  traffic  in  goods and  persons  53  which,  from  the  time  of  the  American  Civil  War  onward,  was  also  subject,  for military  purposes,  to  telegraphic  command.54  However,  in  the  form  of  goods  and  people  traffic, the  post  lost  two  of  its  traditional  functions.  It  was  forced  to  become  a  pure  information

technology  based  on  the  principles  of  house  numbers  and  letterboxes,  prepayment  with  stamps and  the  world  postal  union.55 This  detachment  from  the  ground  whose  distances  (as  in  synchronous  mathematical topography)  are,  in  contrast  to  all  pre-modern  postal  systems,  no  longer  calculated  because  only absolute  speed  counts,  brought  internationality:  from  the  stock  exchange  reports  of  world  trade and  the  telegraph  agencies  of  the  world  press,  to  colonial  empires  which,  like  the  British  Empire, were  founded  on  a  "fleet  in  being"  and  consequently  on  a  global  undersea  cable  monopoly.56 Technical  repercussions  of  telegraphy  as  information  time  made  discrete,  were  consequential inventions  which  paradoxically  also  processed  precisely  the  continuous  signal  sources.  Of  these I  shall  pass  over  the  analog  medium  of  photography  which  requires  a  treatment  of  its  own  and mention  only  the  telephone,  gramophone  record  and  film. Bell's  telephone,  the  most  lucrative  single  patent  of  all  time,  came  about  in  1876  not  by  any means  in  its  familiar  function,  but  in  the  course  of  an  attempt  to  transmit  several  messages  over  a single  telegraph  cable  at  the  same  time.  In  exactly  the  same  way  only  a  year  later  Edison's phonograph  emerged  as  a  spin-off  from  an  attempt  to  increase  the  throughput  rate  of  telegraph cables.  And  finally  Muybridge's  scientific  serial  photographs  which,  in  1895,  after  the  invention  of Maltese  cross  and  celluloid  paved  the  way  for  cinema,  were  triggered  by  electric  telegraph relays. Film  and  gramophone,  these  mass-reproducible  competitors  to  Edison's  phonographs,  made  it possible  to  store  optical  and  acoustical  data  as  such.  Because  analog  media  underbid,  first mechanically  and  subsequently  electrically,  the  perceptual  thresholds  determined  by  Fechner, they  can  recognise  in  speech  phonemes  and  musical  intervals  -  which  is  where  the  Greek analysis  as  their  being  the  final  alphabetical  elements  stopped  -  complex  frequency  mixtures which  are  open  to  a  further,  and  since  Fourier,  mathematical,  analysis.  The  modern  fundamental concept  of  frequency  57,  which  since  Euler  governs  probability  calculation,  music  and  optics alike,  has  replaced  the  arts  with  technical  media.  This  physics  in  the  simulation  process  of  the real  is  no  longer  partnered  in  the  reception  process  by  a  language-based  mnemonics  or pedagogy,  but  by  a  sensory  physiology  which  has  guaranteed  the  media  their  world-wide  and, thanks  to  Shannon's  measure  of  information,  calculable  success.58  At  the  same,  time  a knowledge  gap  between  unconscious  media  effects  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  innovatory  thrusts on  the  other,  (which  since  Edison's  first  laboratory  are  also  plannable)  has  emerged  which, despite  the  participation  of  women  in  telegraph,  telephone  and  typewriter  operations  59  is inimical  to  the  general  development  of  literacy  and  absolutely  rules  out  communication  on communication. A  prominent  role  in  this  turning-point,  whose  significance  is  probably  equalled  only  by  the invention  of  writing  60,  was  taken  by  Maxwell's  electromagnetic  field  equations  and  their experimental  substantiation  by  Heinrich  Hertz.  Since  Christmas  1906,  when  Fessenden's  radio transmitter  broadcast  low-frequency  random  events  as  they  occur  as  amplitude  or  frequency modulation  of  a  high  frequency,  there  exist  non-material  channels.  Since  1906,  when  de  Forest developed,  from  Edison's  light  bulb,  the  controllable  valve,  information  is  open  to  any  kind  of amplification  and  manipulation.  The  valve  radio,  developed  as  wireless  telephony  for  breaking the  imperial  cable  monopoly,  first  of  all  made  the  new  weapons  systems  of  the  first  World  War, the  aeroplane  and  the  tank,  both  mobile  and  dirigible  by  remote  control  61,  and  after  the  end  of the  war,  was  applied  to  the  civilian  populations.62

In  the  guise  of  a  "secondary  orality"  63,  bypassing  the  written  word,  radio  had  the  effect  of standardising  unwritten  languages,  primarily  through  world-wide  short-wave  broadcasting 64,thus  transforming  colonised  tribal  associations  into  independent  nations.65  In  the  same  way the  telephone,  in  its  progress  from  the  direct  dialling  system  via  frequency  multiplex  to  satellite links,  has  made  possible  the  non-hierarchical  networking  firstly  of  cities  and  ultimately  of  the "global  village".66  Yet  the  publicly  accessible  wavebands  remain,  despite  their  critical overcrowding  67,  only  fractions  of  a  frequency  spectrum  which,  from  long-wave  broadcasting  to the  decimetre  radar,  exercises  governmental  or  military  control  functions  and  taps  all  public wavebands  for  the  secret  services.68 The  electrification  of  sensory  input  data  through  transducers  and  sensors  enabled  the entertainments  industry  to  couple  analog  storage  media  firstly  with  one  another  and  secondly with  transmission  media.  The  sound  film  combined  optical  and  acoustic  memories;  radio,  before the  introduction  of  the  tape-recorder,  largely  transmitted  gramophone  records;  the  first  television systems,  prior  to  the  development  of  electronic  cameras,  scanned  feature  films.  Thus  the  content of  entertainment  media  always  remains  another  medium  which,  in  this  way,  they  serve  to promote. But  all  these  couplings  of  technologies  which  are  already  individually  standardised,  even though  they  gave  birth  to  aesthetic  forms  from  the  radio  play  and  electronic  music  to  the videoclip,  have  one  decisive  deficiency:  there  is  no  general  standard  which  regulates  their control  and  reciprocal  translation.  This  is  precisely  the  point  at  which  the  heroes  and  heroines  of Benjamin's  theory  of  media  came  to  the  rescue  in  the  form  of  editors  in  film  studios  and  sound engineers  for  tape  with  their  celebrated  but  strictly  manual  montage  techniques.69  The  rendering obsolete  of  this  human  intervention  and  the  automation  of  a  general  standard  was  reserved  for digital  technology. 2.  Digital  Technology Digital  technology  functions  like  an  alphabet  but  on  a  numerical  basis.  It  replaces  the continuous  functions  into  which  the  analog  media  transform  input  data,  which  are  generally  also continuous,  with  discrete  scannings  at  points  in  time  as  equidistant  as  possible,  in  the  same  way that  the  24  film  exposures  per  second,  or  at  a  much  higher  frequency  since  the  Nipkow  screen television  did  before.  This  measurement,  followed  by  evaluation  in  the  binary  number  system,  is the  precondition  for  a  general  media  standard. According  to  the  scanning  theorem  of  Nyquist  and  Shannon,  any  and  every  form  of  signal, provided  it  is  frequency-range-limited  intrinsically  or  through  filtering,  can  be  bi-univocally reconstructed  from  scanned  values  of  at  least  twice  the  frequency.70  The  quantisation  noise which  necessarily  arises  in  the  process  can  also,  in  contrast  to  the  physically-determined  noise of  analog  systems,  be  minimised  to  any  degree  simply  because  it  obeys  the  laws  of  a  digital system.71 It  was  in  1936  that  Turing's  universal  discrete  machine  stated  the  principle  of  all  digital technology.  Extrapolating  or  reducing  the  equally  discrete  typewriter  72,  it  consisted  simply  of  an endless  paper  tape,  the  idea  of  which  goes  back  to  1800.  On  this  "paper  machine"  for  data storage,  a  write/read/erase  head  for  data  processing  could  write  the  binary  signs  0  and  1  while  a transport  device  for  data  addressing  made  it  possible  to  access  the  neighbouring  signs  right  and left.  Turing  proved  however  that  this  elementary  machine,  because  by  contrast  to  the  noisy

Laplace  universe  it  knows  a  finite  number  of  states,  is  equal  not  only  to  any  mathematician  but solves  all  (in  Hilbert's  sense)  decidable  problems  of  mathematics  through  simulation  of  any  other correctly-programmed  machine.73 Thus  the  Turing  machine  concluded  in  its  universality  all  developments  for  the  storing,  indexing and  processing  of  both  alphabetical  and  numerical  data.  In  the  alphabetical  field  these developments  had  led  from  lists  and  catalogues,  via  the  card  indexes  from  which  around  1800 Jean  Paul's  literature  and  Hegel's  philosophy  had  sprung  74,  to  the  Hollerith  machine  of  the American  census  of  1890.75  In  the  numeric  field  a  parallel  development  had  led  from  Schickart's calculator  for  the  four  basic  types  of  calculation,  via  Jacquard's  programmable  looms  76,  to  the pioneer  of  computers,  Babbage,  whose  differential  engine  of  1822  reduced  the  time-consuming developments  of  series  in  trigonometry  and  ballistics  to  recurrent  difference  equations  while  his later  planned  analytical  engine  was  intended  to  make  the  whole  of  analysis  calculable  with conditional  jump  commands.77  To  achieve  the  alphanumeric  universality  of  Turing  machines, alias  computers,  however,  the  two  development  strands  had  to  be  brought  together  by  Boole's logical  algebra  and  Goedel's  theorem  of  incompleteness,  making  statements  and  axioms  as manipulable  as  figures. The  Turing  machine  of  1936  was  infinitely  slow,  its  paper  tape  infinitely  long  and  therefore inexistent.  By  contrast  the  computer,  its  technical  successor,  is  a  miracle  of  economy  of  time  and space  called  forth  by  the  exigencies  of  the  second  World  War.  At  the  same  time  that  Shannon was  demonstrating  that  simple  relays  connected  in  series  or  in  parallel  can  automate  all operations  of  Boole's  algebra  78,  Zuse  was  building  the  first  computers  for  Luftwaffe  research from  telegraph  relays  while  the  cryptography  department  of  the  Wehrmacht  rejected  his  offers  of automation.79  At  the  end  of  1943,  by  contrast,  the  British  secret  service  came  up  with  computers based  on  overmodulated  tubes  for  Turing's  war-deciding  cryptoanalysis  of  precisely  that  secret VHF  radio  traffic  which  had  made  the  German  blitzkrieg  possible.80  Finally,  in  1945,  John  von Neumann  designed  the  now  customary  architecture  of  sequential  but  microsecond-fast computers  for  the  planned  American  uranium  bomb  whose  rate  of  explosion  set  new  standards in  the  measurement  of  time.81 Von  Neumann's  design  postulated  the  following  three  system  elements: Firstly  a  central  processing  unit  for  command-controlled  processing  of alphanumeric  data  by  either  mathematical  or  logical  rules; Secondly  a  write-read  memory  for  variable  data  and  a  read-only  memory  for programmed  commands; Thirdly  a  bus  system  for  sequential  transmission  of  all  these  data  and commands  as  bi-univocally  indicated  through  binary  addresses  by  pages  and columns. With  these  three  parts,  von  Neumann  machines  articulated  the  fundamental  structure  of information  technology  as  a  functional  interrelationship  of  hardware  elements.  No  matter whether  their  environment  supplies  alphabetic  or  numerical  data,  that  is,  writing  or  media- generated  values,  the  commands,  data  and  addresses  are  all  represented  internally  by  binary numbers.  The  classic  distinction  between  functions  and  arguments,  operators  and  numerical values  has  become  permeable.  However  it  is  precisely  this  breakdown  of  the  alphabet  which

also  permits  operations  to  be  applied  to  operations,  and  ramifications  to  be  automated.  Which  is why  computers  in  principle  comprehend  all  other  media  and  can  subject  their  data  to  the mathematical  procedures  of  signal  processing.82 Data  throughput  and  access  time  depend  solely  on  physical  parameters.  Since  1948,  when the  transistor  replaced  the  tubes/printed  circuits  of  the  second  World  War,  and  1968  when integrated  circuits  replaced  the  single  transistor,  in  each  case  reducing  the  space  and  time requirement  by  a  factor  of  ten,  real  time  analyses  and  real  time  syntheses  of  one-dimensional data  flows  (of  speech  or  music  for  example)  are  no  longer  any  problem.83  So  the  sound  engineer can  go  home.  However,  for  multi-dimensional  signal  processing  in  real  time,  such  as  is  required for  television  pictures  or  computer  animations,  the  von  Neumann  architecture  becomes  a bottleneck.  For  this  reason  large  numbers  of  parallel  computers  are  already  in  use,  and biological  and  optical  circuitry  such  as  is  required  above  all  for  the  simulation  of  brain  functions, is  already  under  development.  The  day  is  not  far  off  when  signal  processing  will  reach  the physical  limits  of  feasibility.84 This  absolute  limit  is  where  the  history  of  communication  technologies  will  literally  come  to  an end.  Theoretically  there  remains  only  the  question  as  to  what  logic  this  completion  will  have obeyed.  From  Freud  85  to  McLuhan  the  classic  answer  to  this  was  a  generic  subject  -  humanity which  before  of  an  indifferent  or  interferent  natural  world  would  have  externalised  first  its  motor and  sensory  interface,  and  finally  its  intelligence,  in  technical  prosthetics.  However  if  Shannon's mathematisation  of  information  rested  on  his  "fundamental  idea"  of  inferring,  through  a conceptual  transfer,  the  "information  efficiency  of  a  jammed  transmission"  from  its cryptoanalytical  efficiency  86,  interference  will  only  be  understandable  as  the  interventions  of  a hostile  intelligence,  and  the  history  of  communication  technologies  as  a  series  of  strategic escalations.  Without  reference  to  the  individual  or  to  mankind,  communication  technologies  will have  overhauled  each  other  until  finally  an  artificial  intelligence  proceeds  to  the  interception  of possible  intelligences  in  space.87 Notes 1.

Preface IT'S  EARLY  in  the  twenty-first century, and that means that these words will mostly be read by nonpersons--automatons or numb mobs composed of people who are no longer acting as individuals. The words will be minced into atomized search-engine keywords within industrial cloud computing facilities located in remote, often secret locations around the world. They will be copied millions of times by algorithms designed to send an advertisement to some person somewhere who happens to resonate with some fragment of what I say. They will be scanned, rehashed, and misrepresented by crowds of quick and sloppy readers into wikis and automatically aggregated wireless text message streams. Reactions will repeatedly degenerate into mindless chains of anonymous insults and inarticulate controversies. Algorithms will find correlations between those who read my words and their purchases, their romantic adventures, their debts, and, soon, their genes. Ultimately these words will contribute to the fortunes of those few who have been able to position themselves as lords of the computing clouds. The vast fanning out of the fates of these words will take place almost entirely in the lifeless world of pure information. Real human eyes will read these words in only a tiny minority of the cases. And yet it is you, the person, the rarity among my readers, I hope to reach. The words in this book are written for people, not computers. I want to say: You have to be somebody before you can share yourself.

WRITING

A bone, a pebble, and a ramskin ... Thus an inventory ofprimc>rdlaj, jects that James Joyce evokes in his novel Finnegans Wake to dis:tirlgu writing from other media. The setting forth of writing in this draws our attention to the stark muteness of three-dimensional or ~a-dimensional surfaces which all inscriptions begin and This insight is worth pondering 1"sofar as it permits us to reckon the biomechanics of writing as a, technology. But is writing not a tern of representation like other visual and verbal codes? Yes, no doubt about it, and we will address the symbolic function ofwr:iti in__,due course.

discourses on this subject. 5 In this essay, we identify and discuss six key :registers concerning writing and consider their implications for unde!standing politics, technology, histoqr and socjoeconomic organizatio~:

(1) How much do we know about the origins of writing? Is the question
of origin inevitable and important? (2) In what sense is literacy central to political governance and imperial projects, past and present? What kinds

the ruling class, the state, or empire through writing? (3) By what script and visual medium is writing to be known or knowable? How do alphabetical and nonalphabetical writing, on the one hand, and mathematical and cryptographic symbols, on the other; compare in the context of a broader semiotic conception of the visual/verbal/ spatial production of meaning? (4) How did writing evolve from antiquity to the invention of print and mass media? This bears upon the technological dimensions of writin'g that open the dialectic of orality and literacy to fortlier inquiry in . light of mechanical (re)production$ of the audiovisual sensorial contioc uum. (s) Is writing a visual represe*tation of speech? This familiar issue brings a "itumber of different positidJ:!S into play, including structural linguistics, metaphysics, and grammatology; our discussion will highlight the relevance of these positions to some of the other registers treated in this essay. (6) Finally, in what ways does digital media transformthe idea of alphabeticil writing to take us where we are, or into what media theorist Marshall McLuhan termed global village"? The past century has Witnessed spectacular archaeological discoveries that makeit easier than ever for scholars to map out the writing systems of the world and hypothesize their origin~. Whereas the iconographic origin of writing is widely observed across civilizations, scholars disagree . as to how one might interpret ancient iconic signs, such as petroglyphs or Amerindian pictographs, as instances of writing. The beginnings of Mesopotamian writing, or proto-cuneiform, are commonly dated to the end of the fourth millennium BCE, the first consonantai alphabet in , Phoenida to 1200 BCE, and the adoption of alphabets in Greece to 750 BCE.6 Direct archaeological evidence suggests that a we:Jl-cie,·ei<lpe:d torr~. of Chinese writing already existed in the last quarter of the second lennium BCE.7 The evidence brought to ~ght thus far has given good reason to believe that the earliest scripts were invented in· different parts of the four maracterized by urbanization, and a Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mesqamerica,

Since no direct means exist that will give us firsthand knowledge about prehistoric langoage and the origin of writing, scholars have speculated on the basis of available evidence or by analogy with so-called primitive or preliterate societies in the present day. Of the multifarious theories they have advanced, Andre Leroi-Gourhan's paleontology of writing ,offers some of the most interesting theoretical specula-tions to date. In his hook Gesture and Speech, Leroi-Gourha.n examines the evidence of excavated fossil anthropoids preceding Homo sapiens to gather clues about their tool-making and symbol"making activities. Dating what he calls "~birth of graphism" among the late Palaeoanthropians to roughly 35,000 BC!j, he notes neurological linkages between the ·-hand/tools an~e/laz.""lguage, as well as their simultaneous participation in the construction of communication symbols:
Humans, though they started out with the same_formula as primateS, can make tools as well as symbols, both of which derive from the same process or, rather, draw upon the same basic equipment in the brain . ... As soon as there are prehistoric tOols, there is a possibility of a prehistoric language, for tools and language are neurologically linked and cannot be dissociated within the social structure of mankind.

ln the development of ancient writing. The striking predominance of numerical notations-using pebbles, tallies, tokens, and clay containers (bul/ae)-in some of the earliest recorded commerdal transactions, ···. which date back ten thousmd years, has caused some theorists to view mathematics as the earliest precursor to writing.~ Rather than evolvIng, as many suppose, from pictograph to syllabic writing and then to phonetidzation, writing systems could have emerged from a much more complex set of semiotic situations than the single need to record human speech. This conjecture is tangentially supported by the etymology of the Phoenician word spr, to which the English word scribe (and its Latin ro?t and Greek equivalent) can be. traced. The Phoenician word descended ·originally from the verb to count and did not j'cquire the meaning to write untillater.21 This shared ancestry for "inscription" and "counting" sheds Interesting light on the alphabet as an alphanumerical system inaddii tion to being a phonetic tool. In ancient Greek, as in other ahcientwriting systems, the function of the alphabet was already constrained by therequirement of mathematics, because the twenty-four letters of the alphabet plus three additional alphanumeric signs (digamma, koppa, sampi) notated unspoken mathematical concepts based on the enneads of the Egyptian numerical system. In.short, the twenty-seven Greek characters
were part of a total semiotic universe of writing-a11:d reasoning. that en-

compassed phonetic representation 'but went well beyond it. 22 In ordinary parlance; ~alphabet" is used interchangeably with "script" on the one hand and "writing system" on the other. It is helpful to maintain careful distinctions among these terms to avoid contusion when we discuss writing. For instance, when the Greeks adspted the conventional P_hoenirian Semjtjc consonantal aiM-abet and Cypriote syllabary to their spoken language, what they imported into·Greek was not a writing sysf<which·they created a new writing systeffi: tem b By Coulmas's definition, writing·systems are langnage-spe c w ere scripts typically are not-therehave be!!n faifewer scripts than writing systems .in the world. A script may coiricide with a single writing system,

such as the Korean phonetic script Han'gul, which is used for no other

language, but the opposite is often true. The Devanagari script in India,
to take an example, is used for a variety of languages, such as Hindi, Ne-

pali, and Marathi. Alternatively, Hindi and Urdu are virtually the same spoken language. but Hindi is written in pevanagari whereas Urdu is written in Perso-Arabic script. 23 The (Chinese) square-block character script has been adopted to create a great variety of writing systems in Asia: Japanese, classical Korean, Vietnamese, among others, including some obsolete ones. The Roman alphabet, in the course of Christian evangelization and modern colonialism, has been adapted to numerous languages in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. For instance, the Wade-Giles system

and, more recently, the Pinyin alphabet (with twenty-one consonants and fifteen vowels/diphthongs)-used to transcribe the phonemes of written Chinese characters for the purpose of standardized translation,
school pedagogy, and, increasingly in our time, access to global "elec-

tracy" (literacy in electronic media), whiCh is primarily coded in English -are not themselves writing systems but notational scripts based on the Roman alphabet. , From the viewpoint ofbiomechanicmedia, the dissemination of writing has been accompanied by an impressive variety of instruments of

inscriptio~, ranging from bones, shells, clay, bronzes, stone, papyrus,
parchment, bamboo, silk, wood, brushes, quills, and ink, all the way to the invention of paper, print or typography, and chips for electronic processing. Different mediums have no doubt made their imprints on writing, reading, and bo(>krnaking. Tsuen-Hsuin Tsien suggests that the predominantly do"!!lward strokes of written Chinese characters and the vertical, right to left,· arrangement of lines have to do with the material and tools of writing before the invention of paper in China in 105 CE. The hand holding the writing brush (by a right-handed scribe) was constrained by the grain of bamboo and wood surfaces and by the narrow strips,which allowed only a single line ofcharacters.:' Likewise, Egyptian hieroglyphs, when chiseled on stone monuments, were carefully formed and decorative in shape when compared with writing on papyrus, which peinlitt;ed cursive or hieratic forms to develop and accommodated rapid W:rltirtg (Innis 1972, 16).

The adaptability of the alphabet to movable type and large· scale machine industry translated gradually into the rise of universal _Aif·~acy, newspapers, vernacular fiction, advertising, and new forms of .-/ trade and politics. Observing th!' tremendous effects of printing on the transformation of psychic and social life in Europe and elsewhere, Marshall McLnban pointed out in The Gutenberg Galaxy that "the invention of typography confirmed and extended the 11ew visual stress of applied knowledge, providing the first uniformly repeatable commodity, the first assembly-line, and the first mass-production."30 The mechanization of scribal art introduced a new level of "repeatable precision that inspired totally new forms of extending social energies :'31 In English literature, as W.. J. T. Mitchell d,emonstrates in Picture Theory, this typographic imagination gav~ rise to William Blake's innovative poetic idiom and "a visible

language of graphic and typographic signifiers",(1994, 129). Writing and its relation to visuality lie at the heart of a long-standing phil<;\sophical discourse on writing, scripts, language, repres~ntation,' and truth in the West." In Phaedrus, Plato's ambivalence about writing· shows up in his distrust of visual arts in general and his fear that ing might supplant or destroy memory (which, not surplisinglly,,;ant;i~ pated the kinds of anxieties that followed upon the introduction in fifteenth-century Europe and the personal computer inour.time fantasy about downlgading the human mind or memory mt:o ·t:n!j puter resonates with that fear).

than on, the history of writing began to assume an evolutionary guise or what Mitchell characterizes as "a story of progress from primitive picture-writing and gestural sign language to hieroglyphics to alphabetic writing 'proper"' (1994, 113). Thus, Jean-Jacques Rousseau hypothesized In The Origin of Language that "the depicting of objects is appropriate to a savage people; signs of words and of propositions, to a barbaric people, and the alphabet to civilized people." 35 Dr. Johnson called the Chinese 1 'barbarians" on a sliding scale of evolutionary progress for the reason that "they have not an alphabet."" The superiority of the alphabet to pictographic, syllabic, and ideographic scripts is generally attributed to its unique ability to represent speech." ../ This colonial, evolutionary theory of writing has posed numerous obstacles to a dear understanding of the relationship among visuality, writing, and language. Not only does it misrepresent nonalphabetical writing as a failure in the teleological mard1 toward.phoneticization, but it simultaneously obscures the process whereby alphabetic writing has evolved as an alphanumerical technology from antiquity to the rise of informatics. As we know, alphabetic letters are no less visual symbols than nonalphabetic writing but, compared >yith the latter, are mud> easier to learn and to reproduce. The linearity, simplicity, and analytical powers of alphabetical writing have facilitated its dissemination around the world, although the same phonetic function is also capable of suppressing the spatial, ard1itectori.ic~ cilld-gesturaJ. dimensions of h~an communication. T~he mod:ernist poet Ezra Pound saw the limitations and tried to mitigate them by incorporating nonalphabetic d1aracters in his English verse. Depending on how one frames the issue and what social functions one expects writing to fuifill, $ere are advantages and limitations to both alphabetical · and nonalphabetical forms of writing that need not be elaborated here. From .the hindsight of informatics, the sing)llar advantage enjoyed by j alphabetical writing over nonalphabetic writing is the algorithmic po, tentials of alphabetic letters with respect to cryptography, ·machine, and mathematics; whid1 overshadow its mud> tOl-\ted power of phoneticiza. tion '!Jith respect to hum,an communication.

sists of a signifier and a signified. The signifier is a discrete linguistic el1 ement, such as the sound unit known as the ·phoneme," or a graphic <;<( '· .(\ image, but it primarily assumes the material aspect of the sign in the~ form of a sound image. The signified consists of a conceptual image or , ~ j\V t'( idea which is arbitrarily fixed onto the sound image, arbitrarily in the 1 sense that no natural correspon4ence exists between so~nd and concept. ~t;J The relation between signifier and signified and their relation to other signs within the system determine the differential value of each sign. According to Saussure, synchronic analysis can shed important light on the diachronic understanding of language change as well: Let there be.no mistake about the meaning that we attach to the word 'change'. One might think that it deals especially with phonetic changes undergone by the signifier,. or perhaps, changes in meaning which af, feet the signified concept. That view would. be inadequate. Regardless of
what the foUeS of change are, whether in isolation or in combination, they always result in a shift in the relationship between the signified and the signifier. 36 :

story signifies and circulates among the various agents without the help
of any particular signified. As a pure signifier, the letter's movement,

displacement, and retrieval alone can support the full weight of a fictional drama about royal intrigues and detective interventions. 40 Poe, of

course, had been fascinated by cryptographic code and other pure signifiers in his time. The central enigma of another of his celebrated stories,

"The Gold-Bug," for example, presents itself as a textual problem: How to crack an unknown code to find the hidden treasure? Curiously, the code-handwritten on a piece of parchment-consists of not only familiar numerals, letters, and punctuation marks but typographical symbols (*, ~.f. t, etc.) that would have been rare or nonexistent in manuscript (parchment) culture but are abundant in typography-whicli was the medium of Poe's story. Friedrich Kittler's contention that Lacan's theoretical apparatus was indebted to the evolution of modern media technologies might easily be extended to explain Poe, whose passion for typography and cryptoanalysis anticipated the arrival of information theory in our own time. For Lacan, the symbolic enjoys the status of typography, whereas the real and the imaginary correspond, respectively, to phonography and film (Kittler 1999, 18). In the other words, the typewriter, gramophone, and film provide the conceptual and technological framework within which Lacanian psychoanalysis begins to make sense. · · Kittler reminds us further that Nietzsche "changed from argrunents ' to aphorisms, from thoughts to puns, from rhetoric to telegram style" when he became the first philosopher to use a typewriter (1999, 203). Through print and electronic media, alphabetic writing has .come to dominate the world of communication. McLul1an was quick to grasp the implications of this development and·tef!Oed the phonetic alphabet a "cool. and uniform visual medium"rfor good reason. 41 Intuitive refiect:ion,s .on the function of the phonetic alphabet seem to support the in1pression that letters stand for the sounds of speech. But what sounds? C. K Ogden, the ar~tect of BASIC English along with the literary critic I. A. Richards, once complained about the irregularities of phonetic represen" taqon in English, stating that ''the vowels represent not 7 sounds but 54,.the 26letters of the alphabet giving a total of 107 v.jlues, or with the \'owel digraphs ('each', 'ou', etc.) and multigraphs ('eau', etc.) 28o." Com1\l~.dirtg the burden of 280 sound.values and their various combinatoare tlj.e statisticalhu~dles at the level of English vocabulary. "To ail these in a v<:'c.abularyof 2o,ooo words, or even 2,ooo," says l·.i"'1~c·es·oitattes an am<?,unt of drudgery which has given phonetilyocat·es of synthetic languages their opportunity."42 contested theory of which discrete units of speech <in·phon<,ticall}' be represented by which letters (as in the

case of /ks/, written as one letter, x, in English), there is also the cognitive question of how the written code relates meaningfully to the linguistic image in the mind. In a cybernetic leap of faith, Norbert Wiener and his colleagues experimented with the idea of bypassing both hearing and vision so that deaf-mutes could arrive at instant comprehension of verbal signs through touch rather than gesture. Their experiment brings to mind Rousseau's description in The Origin of Language of how traders in India conducted business by taking each other by the hand, varying their grip in such a way as to perform secret transactions in public, unobserved by others and without uttering a single word. 43 That is to ~ say, sight, hearing, and speech need not to be present for communica=_&' tion.to take place. Wjener's experiment rested on a similar premise about communication, except that it also involved a translation of acoustic signals in the form of physical vibrations in the air, which, fed through a tactile device, would correspond to an experience of meaning in the recfiver's mind.44 Even so, Wiener's sensory prosthesis begs the question of how the tactile code relates to the conceptual processes in the mind. Cryptography and information theory tried to get around the cogni" tive issue byworlcing exclusively with alphanumerical symbols in a math·'e'matical remapping of communication. Alan Turing and Claude Shan.non unifonnly took the printed letters d£ the English alphabet as therr cpoint of departure. Shannon, the inventor of information theory, approached English as a statistical system, which he termed "Printed Enc glish," and subjected alphabetic writing to algorithmic thinking and engineering on behalf of informatics. This peculiar English is comp,;sed of the twenty-six-letter alphabet (A to Z) plus a twenty-seventh letter that mathematically codes "space." In otherword'e, Printed English is an ideographical alphabet with a definable .statistical structure. As a postphonetic system, .-it functions as a conce tual interface between natu I:ingU.age and .Wam;_ue:Jan.gJrqge This postphone c co · tis predicated on the symbolic correspondences between the twenty-seven letters and their numeral· counterparts in lieu of mapping the letters onto the phonemic units in. the spoken language. The alphanumerical correspondence not only facilitates the encoding of messages in information systems but also enables a rethinking of the idea of communication. The centrality of printed S)llilbol for tei:hnology has something to do with the · fact that; to use Friedrich A. Kittler's words, "in contrast to the flow of handwriting, we nowhave discrete elements separated by spaces" (1999; 16). The "space" symbol in Printed English is a conceptual figure, ·l)!>t<!'; viSible Word divider as is commonly observed in some WYiti;tlgs)'o!l:~i'1J The sign. may showup as a negative value or as the visible abo;encec ters, but.the twenty-seventh letter is just as likely to bem>>tll.&l

Nietzsche made a prescient remark in 1.878: "The press, the machine,

the railway, the telegraph are premises whose thousand-year conclusion no one has yet dared to draw.''4S As one of the most significant inventions since World War II, Printed English is a direct offspring of telegraphy because it is based on a dose analysis of Morse code conducted by Shannon himself. In his pathbreaking essay "A Mathematical Theory of Communi_cation" published in the Bell System Technical Journal194B, shannon lrud the statistical foundation of information theory. Two years later, he published another article called "Prediction and Entropy of Printed Eng~sh," _which further elaborated the experimental work in co_nnecti_on With his work. These studies suggest numerous connecttons w:tth ·. 'Shannon s code work in World War II when he had investigated the statistical aspects of alphabetic writing i~ cryptoanalysis and helped design secrecy systems at Bell Laboratories for the U.S. military. As a discrete, i~eo~aphic symbol, Shannon's twenty-seventhletter is meanin~ preasely m this cryptographic sense.

10. The ter~hich was Gelb's coinage, means word writing. It is widely adopted

to distinguish a written sign that transcribes a word unit rather than a sound unit in speech. The rebus principle involves a process of phonetic abstraction whereby the graph of one word is borrowed to transcribe another word on the basis of homophony although the two words are semantically unrelated. A modern example in English is "U2" used as shorthand for "you, too" or "you two."

Preface

Knowledge of the world means dissolving the solidity of the world. -Italo Calvino, Six Memos for the Next Millenium
n one sense the story running through this book is a very old story. We sometimes see it as the story of Faust and Margaret, and it comes again as Beauty and the Beast or as any of that wondrous fairy tale's mutations. A hundred years ago Henry Adams recognized its emergence in a historical tension he named the Dynamo and the Virgin. The Computer and the Book-their relation has much in common with those three legends. For the book was once upon a time the very emblem of Faustian power. As late as 1870 Emily Dickinson could think that "There is no Frigate like a book." The thought charms us now precisely in its quaintness, since current imaginative voyagings are everywhere traversing digital space. And so bibliographical lamentations begin to arise, "au sont les livres d'antan?" This book is a commentary on that question, and the commentary is organized around two ideas about humanities-based digital instruments. The first is that understanding the structure of digital space requires a disciplined aesthetic intelligence. Because our most developed models for that kind of intelligence are textual models, we would be foolish indeed not to study those models in the closest possible ways. Our minds think in textual codes. Because the most advanced forms of textual codings are what we call "poetical:' the study and application of digital codings summons us to new investigations into our textual inheritance. To date that summons has been slow to develop, which brings me to the second idea that organizes this book. Digital technology used by humani-

ties scholars has focused almost exclusively on methods of sorting, accessing, and disseminating large bodies of materials, and on certain specialized problems in computational stylistics and linguistics. In this respect the work rarely engages those questions about interpretation and self-aware reflection that are the central concerns for most humanities scholars and educators. Digital technology has remained instrumental in serving the technical and precritical occupations of librarians and archivists and editors. But the general field of humanities education and scholarship will not take the use of digital technology seriollsly until one demonstrates how its tools improve the ways we , explore and explain aesthetic works-until, tl,at is, they expand our interpretational procedures. A close relation holds between the book and computer. For textual and digital forms alike, however, this historical continuity has brought questions and problems that have not been studied at all well precisely because the genetic relation between the two media has been too much taken for granted, as if it were simple to see and understand. The situation is emblemized in the dichotomy of enthusiasm and skepticism that marks so much of the current discussion-indeed, that organizes the discussion along two sides. We have to break away from questions like "will the computer replace the book?" So much more interesting are the intellectual opportunities that open at a revelatory historical moment such as we are passing through. These opportunities come with special privileges for certain key disciplines-now, for engineering, for the sciences, for certain areas of philosophy (studies in logic), and the social sciences (cognitive modeling). But unapparent as it may at first seem, scholarship devoted to aesthetic materials has never been more needed than at this historical moment. That necessity leaped to one's attention in 1993 with the coming of the World Wide Web (W3). Until that epochal moment, digital technology had moved at the margins of literary and humanistic studies. The tools were taken up largely by some linguists and form-critical scholars, and by specialists interested in problems of storing and archiving scholarly (textual) materials. Even word-processing tools came slowly into the hands of humanities scholars. We forget that ten years ago-I am writing this sentence in late February 200o-the number of humanities scholars who used any computerized tools at all was relatively small. A discontinuous historical event occurred during those ten years, and in the course of its unfolding emerged W3, the digital environment that organizes and commands the subjects of this book. To the speed and ubiquity of digital intercourse and transaction have been added interface and mul-

timedia, and that, as the poet said, "has made all the difference." Our sense of language will never be the same. Or rather, perhaps, our sense of it-in every sense-has been renewed, restored to something like the richness that it possessed in the Middle Ages, and that is still available in the works descending to us from that remarkable period-pre-eminently in its greatest invention, the medieval church and cathedral. From Santa Sophia to St. Mark's to Monreale, and across all of Europe and England, the doors of human perception were flung open in those amazing multimedia environments. And not only in Europe. Scattered across the globe from China to New Guinea to Egypt to the Nazca desert in Peru are the remains of human inventions of similar and even more amazing complexity. Next to them, even our most recent and advanced virtual reality tools and constructions seem primitive indeed. However toddling they appear, contemporary instruments of hyperand multimedia constitute a profane resurrection of those once-sacred models of communication. To get a clear grasp of their historical emergence one would have to return to the middle and late nineteenth century, when so much of what is apparent today was being forecast: in mathematics and physics, in logic, in the emergence of photography. My own special field of interest, textuality, underwent a great renewal at the same moment. [n England, the work of John Ruskin, D. G. Rossetti, and William Morris catalyzed a complex set of historical forces into the Arts and Crafts movement and, more particularly, into the Renaissance of the Book. In the rediscovered "Grotesque" art of the Middle Ages was heard-the metaphor is deliberately mixed-the first premonition of the famous proverb that would define the coming of the digital age a century later: the medium is the message. This book is a report on some early attempts to understand how that proverb might be read by people interested in humanities education. It is based in certain ideas about language and semiotic systems that recur throughout history-ideas that may seem not to match with many common formulations. In my view, however. the problem here lies in the formulations, not in the actual fact of the matter (so to speak). Recall that even before we began creating formal systems of visual signs--systems that generate this very sentence-object you are now reading-the language we use is woven from audible and visible elements. And as the syntax of that last sentence is designed to suggest, this textual condition of ours is constructed as a play of incommensurable elements, of which temporality is one. Linguistic units are not self-identical, as even the briefest reflective glance at a dictionary will show. Indeed, they don't even

XlV

Preface

occupy fIxed positions within a given textual space-the specialized space of this reading-text, for example--since a variety of overlapping and incommensurable planes transact all textual spaces. Textual space and textual time are n-dimensional simply because they locate embodied actions and events. Computational systems are not designed like the first sentence of the previous paragraph. They are designed to negotiate disambiguated, fully commensurable signifying structures. "Indeed! And so why should machines of that kind hold any positive interest for humanities scholars, whose attention is always focused on human ambiguities and incommensurables?" "Indeed! But why not also ask: How shall these machines be made to operate in a world that functions through such ambiguities and inc ommensurables?" Both of those questions have set the terms for the work of this book. Anyone who works with texts in disciplined ways, and especially those interested in their rhetorical and aesthetic properties, understands very well the incommensurability of textual forms. How to gain some clarity and control over our textual condition has been a perpetual human concern and is a central concern of this book as well. It is organized to show how the work at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (lATH) from 1993 to 2000 led to the practical implementation of catastrophe and quantum models for the critical investigation of aesthetic forms. Suggestive as the ideas of quantum mechanics have been for many humanities scholars, the scale of quantum effects has seemed far removed from the apparent scale of textual and semiotic phenomena. The latter involve macroscopic events, the former submicroscopicindeed, quantum effects are, in the view of many, not objective events at all but simply types of measurements and calculations executed for certain practical ends. It was Roger Penrose, I think, who fIrst argued most effectively against this view. He proposes that "the phenomenon of consciousness is something that cannot be understood in entirely classical terms u and that "a quantum world [might] be required so that thinking, perceiving creatures, such as ourselves, can be constructed from its substance" (Penrose 226). The empirical data of consciousness are texts and semiotic phenomena of all types-"autopoetic u phenomena, in the terms of Humberto Maturana and Francesco Varela. This book will argue that our" classical models for investigating such data are less precise than they might be and that quantum dynamical models should be imagined and can be built. The
U

Preface

book focuses on the historical circumstances that forced this argument into being. It traces the development of certain experiments with textual materials to their unforeseen but, I would now say, necessary consequences: most importantly, the practical illustrations and proposals for new models of critical and interpretational study. One final comment may be helpful. This book's commitment to a "quantum poetics" may call to mind, for Modernist scholars at any rate, Daniel Albright's stimulating and elegant study of certain strains of twentieth-century writing, Quantum Poetics (1997). Albright's book investigates "the appropriation of scientific metaphors by poets" (1) whose work emerged at the same time as the great figures of early-twentieth-century science. Albright argues that these writers exploited certain scientific figures in their imaginative work. My argument is quite different: that quantum and topological models of analysis are applicable to imaginative writing tout court, that these models are more adequate, more comprehensive, and more enlightening than the traditional models we inherit from Plato and Aristotle to Kant and Marx. "Quantum poetics" in this study does not signify certain figures and tropes that stimulated the practices of a certain group of historically located writers. On the contrary, it comprises a set of critical methods and procedures that are meant to be pursued and then applied in a general way to the study of imaginative work. The final discussion of "The Ivanhoe Game" illustrates the difference very clearly. "The Ivanhoe Game" models a new form of critical method. Its applicability is of a general kind-as much for Yeats and Pound as for Keats and Byron, for Shakespeare or Dante, for Ovid, Lucretius, the Bible. It is a model that we propose to build in a new kind of textual environment-a digital one. Finally, it is only a model-one model. We propose to build it in the hope that it may stimulate others to develop and build more adequate critical tools.

Note on the Text

he idea for this book took shape in 1998 to 2000, when most of it was written. The five chapters comprising Parts I and II were drafted earlier, however. Three of those were written between 1993 and 1995 as a related series of critical reflections on The Rossetti Archive and its initial theoretical goals. The two very different chapters tided "The Alice Fallacy" and "Deformance and Interpretation" were written in 1993 and 1996 (respectively). Framing the other three conceptually as well as historically, they define the interpretational issues that had been running through the work we undertook with The Rossetti Archive. The full elaboration of this book's arguments only emerged very late, however, when those interpretational topics and problems had been rehearsed and pursued. This happened in 1998 to 2000 when the rest of the book was written. At that point-the spring of 2000, when "The Ivanhoe Game" was conceived in conversations with Johanna Drucker and John Unsworth-I saw how important "The Alice Fallacy" had been for the development of the arguments being made in this book. I then revised and recast the chapters originally written from 1993 to 1995, and I wrote the introduction, "Beginning Again," as well as the series of critical reflections that introduce the different parts of the book. I played several iterations of "The Ivanhoe Game" with Johanna Drucker and some graduate and undergraduate students (May to November 2000) and finished the book by writing up several accounts of those events, including the last chapter of this book, "Beginning Again and Again."

Introduction

Beginning Again: Humanities and Digital Culture, 1993-2000

we're like the man who climbed on a chair and declared he was a little closer to the moon. -Hubert Dreyfus, What Computers Can't Do
umanities computing is beginning again. It passed through one coherent period of historical development and, more recently, through an exploratory interlude of considerable importance. This book examines that interlude, the years 1993 to 2000, from the perspective of a project I undertook at exactly the same moment (fortuitously as it happened): The Complete Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. A Hypermedia Research Archive ("The Rossetti Archive"}.1 Working on the archive during those years, I began to see more clearly the kinds of change that are coming to literary and humanistic studies. These changes will bring to the center of scholarly procedures theoretical models that have been perceived until now as odd, idiosyncratic, nonnormal. Before 1993 the computerized future of our humanistic inheritance was apparent to a relatively small group of librarians and archival scholars and to very few other people in literary and cultural studies. I am speaking here not of loose and speculative cybernetic conceptions and imaginings, which have been widespread for some 15 years or so, but of practical and concrete understandings of the momentous changes that lay in store for our libraries and other archival depositories. Now, however, in 2000, the community of humanities scholars at large has also begun to see that future with greater clarity and to feel the pressure of its demands. In 1993 when projects like The Rossetti Archive sought funding for their work, the applications failed. Then the scholarly community was not prepared to

judge either the need or the adequacy of such projects. The situation in 2000 is different, for many educators now understand that our inherited .....archive of materials in libraries and museums will have to be re-edited Twith information technology (IT) tools. We see as well the kind of massive reorganization that will have to be carried out in these depositories in order to store, connect, and conveniently access their holdings. All this work is already well underway. But also now in 2000 some are being pushed further by the inertia of the new tools being placed at our disposal. Ideas about textuality that were once taken as speculative or even imaginary now appear to be the only ones that have any practical relation to the digital environments we occupy every day. So that now all of aesthetic, literary, and humane studies appear brinked for major changes in the ways they will be studied, analyzed, and interpreted. 2 This book tells a story of how we got to where we are now. The story describes how certain theoretical views of textuality once considered weird, impractical, and unserious discovered their moment of realization in the digital world of the late twentieth century. I first taught the works of Lautreamont,Jarry, and Roussel at the University of Chicago in the late 1960s and early 1970s in courses I then called "The Literature of Excess:' Authors of their kind treated documents as scenes of predse imaginative possibilities. None approached their work in the spirit of a romantic hermeneutics: that is to say, under a horizon where multiple meanings are generated by readers working in and through texts imagined on an analogy with.the Bible. Those kinds of text appear to us as massively authoritative and deeply mysterious, requiring devotional study to uncover their secret meanings. Reconnecting with certain performative and rhetorical traditions, however, writers like larry laid a groundwork for post-romantic procedural writing. They began to make clear once again the constructed character of textuality-the fact that texts and documents are fields open to decisive and rule-governed manipulations. In this view of the matter, texts and documents are not primarily understood as containers or even vehicles of meaning. Rather, they are sets of instantiated rules and algorithms for generating and controlling themselves and for constructing further sets of transmissional possibilities. 3 How I came to write that previous paragraph constitutes the story being told in this book.
Points of Departure

In the fall of 1993 we began work on The Rossetti Archive and in July 2000 saw the public release of its first research installment: an online hyperme-

dia construction of some 10,000 image and text fIles organized for use (and experiment) by students and scholars with many disciplinary interests. (When the archive is completed it will contain more than twice that number of files.) During those initial seven years the archive-along with the whole field of humanities computing--was swept in directions no one foresaw in 1992. The project was consciously begun as a pragmatically-based theoretical undertaking-in fact, an experiment in Ian Hacking's sense4-to explore the nature of textuality: in particular, book and paper-based textualities, as well as the editorial methods for marking and interpreting these kinds of texts. The archive was built under the auspices of the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (lATH), which was founded the same year as The Rossetti Archive was begun. The humanities computing work sponsored by IATH-a large array of research projects in texts, media, images, and information-can now be seen to mark the end of a fIrst and distinct phase in the history of humanities computing. Our experience in building The Rossetti Archive is an epitome of what happened at lATH between 1993 and 1999, when humanities computing began to move in very new directions.5 A brief historical note here will be helpful. The use of IT in humanities disciplines began in the late 1940s with Father Roberto Busa SJ, whose work on the corpus of St. Thomas Aquinas set the terms in which humanities computing would operate successfully for more than 40 years. 6 Two lines of work dominate the period: first, the creation of databases of humanities materials-almost exclusively textual materials-for various types of automated retrieval, search, and analysis; second, the design and construction of statistical models for studying language formalities of many kinds, ranging from social and historical linguistics to the study of literary forms. Viewed from the perspective of a humanities scholar's interests, this work has had its greatest impact on the library, which began its extraordinary digital reconstitution during this period.? Because the library locates the center, if not the very soul, of arts and humanities studies, this transformation carries enormous consequences for humanities students and educators. Hand catalogues have virtually disappeared and libraries everywhere are offering larger, more varied, and more integrated bodies of electronically organized and connected materials. While everyone is directly affected by these changes in the library at the general access level, and to an increasing degree in the area of reference works of different kinds, few people, including very few humanities schol-

4

ars, have been touched by more specialized work with stylometrics, cladistics, and tools for automated collation and author-attribution. This situation is especially clear in the United States, where New Criticism and its theoretical aftermath exiled nearly all kinds of statistical, editorial, and textual work to the periphery of humanities studies. Because humanities computing in its first phase was so closely linked to computationallinguistics, on one hand, and to textual/editorial studies, on the other, the central lines of work in literary and cultural studies between 1950 and t 990 remained virtually untouched by developments in humanities computing. To the degree that IT attracted the attention of humanities scholars, the interest was largely theoretical, engaging the subjects of media and culture in either speculative and relatively abstract ways or journalistic treatments. That situation has kept most humanities scholars in a state of invincible ignorance of one of the most remarkable achievements of this early phase of humanities computing: the design and development of systems for the structural description (or "marking") of textual materials. The parent of these developments is SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which is a rigorously articulated logic for marking the structural parts and relations of textual documents (or bodies of material fashioned on a model of textual documents). So far as the humanities are concerned, the signal event was the development of TEl (Text Encoding Initiative). TEl is a specialized markup derivative of SGML, one designed to facilitate computer implementations of traditional humanities texts (literature, history, philosophy). By 1993, when lATH was founded, TEl was establishing itself as a professional standard for text encoding of humanities materials. 8 These dates and events are important because of what happened in the larger world of IT between 1993 and 1994: the definitive appearance of the W3. 9 It is important to remember--not an easy thing to do at this distance-that the coming of W3 seemed to most scholars involved in humanities computing at that time as a trivial event so far as they were concerned. A hypermedia environment established on a global scale, W3 ought to have fed immediately into a number of long-standing theoretical interests in decentered and reader-oriented textualities. The scholarly meetings and journals devoted to humanities computing show with unmistakable clarity, however, that few people in those communities registered the importance of W3. Disinterest was perhaps to be expected from computational scholars, but even the hypertext community barely noticed this truly epochal event before 1995. 10 Hypertext was a playground clearly founded by the enthusiastic descendants of those earlier twentieth-century move-

Beginning Again: Humanities and Digital Culture, 1993-2000

5

ments called New Bibliography and New Criticism. While those children played around in their hypertextual fields, "serious" humanities computing remained located in library and archival technology, on computational analyses of various kinds, and on the closely related fields of textual editing and textual markup. And meanwhile W3 arrived on its own. The period from 1993 to 1999 gains its peculiar shape and significance largely because of the crisis W3 brought to humanities computing. Critical discussion of hypertext and hypermedia explodes throughout cultural and literary studies, with interest now fueled in practical ways by various persons, including scholars like Jay Bolter and George Landow, who launched online hypermedia constructions of many kinds. Before W3, anyone interested in building computerized humanities tools or environments would have had to learn at least elementary programming. W3 ended that situation by making HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) the language of W3 documents. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML was a brilliantly simplified subset of SGML, whose basic rules could be mastered in a few hours. As a consequence, W3 quickly burgeoned, with people throughout the world putting up terabytes of web pages and documents of all kinds. Into that expanding universe of textuality moved a small army of literary students and scholars to create an array of sites designed for various scholarly and pedagogical audiences. Nearly all of these materials were viewed with varying degrees of skepticism or scorn by "the humanities computing community." And with good enough reason since that community had been trying for decades to develop rigorous analytic tools within a traditional milieu of work controlled by careful standards and peer review. These new materials, by contrast, usually appeared from nowhere, the brainchildren of some spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling in a particular person here or there, even a particular scholar. Idiosyncrasy ruled the World Wild West, including its humanities subset. W3 encouraged people to make and send forth digital things on their own initiative and in their own ways. The upside of these events was the coming of a large and diverse population of new people into digital fields previously occupied by small and tightly connected groups. More significantly, they came to build things with digital tools rather than simply to reflect abstractly on the new technologies. This general situation was replicated in humanities disciplines at large. In addition, because W3 was from the beginning of its public life strongly visual rather than textual in character, humanist scholars and students brought a multidisciplinary and multimedia set of interests to the sites they were building and visiting.

Humanities Comp"ting at the University of Virginia: 1992-1993

Insofar as humanities computing existed at the University of Virginia in 1993, it was located at the periphery-in an initiative taken by librarians at the Alderman Library to found an Electronic Text Center. Because few faculty were involved in this initiative, and none direcdy, it began as a speculative institutional venture-a kind of bet made by the library that the center would attract interest and use by the faculty. This center, which flourishes today, was to be an instrument for creating and disseminating electronic texts of various kinds and in many disciplines for the use of students and scholars in class and in research work. The center began its work at a minimal level, all but invisibly to the campus at large, in 1992. It is now the largest disseminator of online humanities texts in the world. Later that same year IBM approached UVA's computer science (CS) department with an offer of $1 million in equipment for educational use over a three-year period. Two CS faculty members, Alan Batson and Bill Wulf, contacted two humanities professors, Ed Ayers and myself, to see if IBM's offer might be useful to people in the arts and sciences division of the university. A small committee was formed of dlese four people plus Kendon Stubbs (the Associate Librarian and chief architect of the library's Electronic Text, or E-Text, Center) and two other CS people. Out of that committee was formed what would become the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (lATH). Because lATH came into being fortuitously, its shape and focus evolved through a randomized state of affairs. To see this let me reset the scene at UVA in late 1992:
(1) The library's E-Text Center was begun as an independent initiative. (2) The grant from mM had not been sought by the library or by anyone in humanities. (3) Ed Ayers and myself were only casually acquainted and neither of us knew, before the establishment of the committee that created lATH, that we each had some interests in humanities computing. (4) The CS faculty who initiated the committee did not have in mind any clear plan for what to do with the IBM offer, nor did they have any close (let alone working) relations with Ed Ayers or myself. When I joined the committee I knew no one on it other than Ed Ayers. (5) Kendon Stubbs joined the committee only after it was initially formed, and at my suggestion (because I had learned from him about the recent founding of the E-Text Center).

Beginning Again: Humanities and Digital Ciliture, 1993-2000

7

I give that list to emphasize the relatively atomized state of affairs when the committee was formed. That loose situation would prove an asset, for it ensured that the committee didn't begin its work in the context of a coherent institutional history or a strong set of prevenient ideas about humanities computing.

The Idea of LATH
The question to be answered by the committee was this: "What should be done with IBM's offer?" Ed Ayers and myself were invited to join the committee because the CS faculty, to whom IBM had made the offer, thought the equipment might be put to best use in the arts and sciences division rather than in the engineering school. As a result of this remarkable act of intramural collegiality (and imagination), this CS-run committee was charging itself only in relation to humanities educational needs. The object was to use the IBM offer to initiate a major change in humanities education at UVA. The overwhelming initial answer to the central question was that the equipment should be made available as soon as possible to all arts and sciences departments for as long as possible. One person, Alan Batson, held out against that position. He argued that to move in this way would be to replicate a known history of 30 years of failure. A genuine engagement between humanities education and computer technology would not get beyond word processing if this model were adopted, Batson argued: "Throwing IT resources at people who have no special interest in them or desire to exploit them doesn't work. We know this because whenever we've done it during the past 30 years the results have been minimal at best." (Those are not exactly his words, but as Thucydides said of his History's reported conversations, I'm giving the substance of what he said.) Batson's model was different: to seek out projects with demonstrable intellectual importance for humanities scholarship and to fund those projects as completely as possible with the technical resources the projects need. His rationale: "Educational change at the level of the university is driven by the active research work of the faculty. Changes in pedagogy and classroom dynamics follow from research." After an intense meeting in which Batson held his position against the rest of the committee, his view prevailed. Further meetings refined and modified Batson's general model. The idea of lATH thus became formulated in the following set of charges:

8

Radiant Textuality
(1) Each year offer fellowships to UVA faculty who submit humanities research proposals to lATH. These should not be proposals for IT teaching initiatives but for scholarly research projects that use IT tools. Successful applicants become fellows of lATH for one year. They are given a one-year release from teaching plus complete technical support for their projects. (2) Try to ensure a diverse, interdisciplinary set of research fellows (rather than a set of closely related projects). (3) Require that the department of the successful fellowship applicants contribute materially to the fellow's work-specifically, by supplying the fellow with one or two graduate students to work on the research project and helping, if possible, with securing release time from teaching.

Two important ideas organize this plan for lATH. First of all, the plan assumes Batson's view that the educational work of a university is driven by its research activities. This idea does not imply that pedagogy is a secondary or less important university function-quite the contrary. But in a university environment students have to expect that their courses and classrooms will be organized in terms of the most up-to-date and adventurous scholarly work-work generated from research agendas that establish the standards and touchstones for a field. In the ideal university setting, a dynamic relation operates between the scholars' research work and the classrooms where it is tested, explored, and modified. Thus one of our key expectations in founding lATH was that its research projects would become gravity centers drawing the attention of other faculty and the interest and work of students. The graduate assistants of the research fellows, it was believed, would themselves become gravity centers affecting other graduate students and undergraduates. In this way IT resources would begin to be exploited in all of the university's educational activities, in the instructional and in the research work of faculty and students alike. Second, the plan for lATH assumed that IT tools would only be taken up by humanities faculty who had an active interest in using these tools in their primary areas of scholarly work. Simply giving equipment to faculty and offering technical support would have a minimal effect, as the dismal history of such efforts in the past has demonstrated. A steep learning curve defines the shape of one's involvement with these tools. Learning to use them is in one respect not unlike learning a new language. You may gain a certain minimal competence fairly quickly, but if your goal is more ambi-

Beginning Again: Humanities and Digital Culture, 1993-2000

9

tious-in this case, to exploit these tools for advanced research work-a deep and long-term investment is required. The problem with developing serious work in humanities computing is complicated by two additional factors. IT tools are in such a volatile stage of development that to use them well one has to remain vigilant about the current state of a wide range of technical resources. This takes time, real effort, and, perhaps most of all, a collective environment. Given the institutional structure of higher education, indexed by the tenure system and its measures of scholarly work, scholars--even tenured scholars-may reasonably conclude that their interests are not served by these tools. It is a fact that right now one can function most efficiendy as a university scholar and teacher by working within the paper-based system we inherit. (This moment, this "now," is quickly passing away.) In face of such a situation, lATH was founded as a resource for people who had already made a commitment to humanities computing, a commitment defined practically by an actual project with demonstrable scholarly importance. There were to be no outright gifts in the arrangement. Everyone involved in a fellow's appointment to lATH would have to make some material commitment to the work. The hope, the goal, of this plan was a transformation of humanities education at UVA. It didn't take five years before we knew that we had succeeded far beyond what we had expected or even, speaking for myself, what we had imagined as possible. In five years the two initial research projects proliferated into more than two dozen. These included projects begun by graduate students as well as regular faculty and library staff. Faculty from more and more university departments became lATH fellows and enriched the institute's work: projects in music, art history, linguistics, architecture, urban planning, religion, archaeology, and so forth. Important work being done by scholars outside UVA gravitated to lATH because of its resources and lively intellectual scene. The hope that the institute's research orientation would catalyze important pedagogical initiatives was also realized. After a few years lATH moved to support certain teaching-oriented initiatives that were driven by serious research agendas. In addition, the institute worked hard to help its fellows exploit the classroom potential of its research projects-a potential that extended well beyond the university to include K12 education as well. As a consequence of all this activity, in 1995 the university established its Teaching Technology Initiative (TTl), a program organized to provide IT resources and technical help to faculty and

10

Radiant Textuality

teaching staff. Similar resources were being made available through the library's E-Text Center. A crucial factor in UVA's involvement with humanities computing was the close liaison that was fostered from the start between lATH and the library. Nothing illustrates the depth of that liaison more than the library's decision to clear out more than 2,000 square feet of its floor space to make room for lATH's faculty and staff offices. This close working relationship expanded the university's research activities in remarkable and innovative ways. Some of the most important theoretical work in humanities scholarship is now being undertaken by faculty, graduate students, and library staff working in collaborative groups. Finally, the remarkable success of lATH resulted in major part because its work from the outset was consciously developed in relation to W3. When John Unsworth was appointed as director in 1993, his first move was to ensure that the institute's projects were designed for web dissemination. Pursuing that direction in 1993 was to move against nearly every current in humanities computing scholarship, which was dominated by "standalone" ideas and technologies (epitomized in the early and short-sighted choice of CD-ROM as the venue for carrying humanities texts and hypertexts). In this situation we see once again the cultural influence of book paradigms on the new digital environments. Or, one should rather say, a certain view of books and book culture-a view defined, as I've already noted, by ideas drawn from New Bibliography and New Criticism. The convergence in 1993 of digital technology and W3 changed the shape of things, and not least the shape of humanities computing.
The Rossetti Archive and the Theory of Scholarly Editing

Under Unsworth's direction, then, the institute's work shifted in various ways from its initial conception and charges. Projects conceived by nonUVA scholars were invited to come to the institute if they brought their own funding, and certain interesting pedagogical projects were taken on board after several years. Most significandy, Unsworth invited important IT projects, especially web-based projects, to locate themselves, or instances of themselves, on the lATH server. On the technical side, a major challenge for the institute and its fellows was to pursue long-term, large-scale humanities computing research projects with an almost ascetic rejection of the surface effects and short-term gains offered by proprietary software and proprietary data standards. In an apparendy paradoxical way, lATH's W3 commitment drove its projects to

Beginning Again: Humanities and Digital Culture, 1993-2000

11

make rigorous logical design a fundamental goal. This pursuit reflected a dedication to portability and the abstraction that enables it-even if it also entailed doing without good tools for creating or disseminating the scholarly work in the short run. As it happened, that commitment was to induce a profound shift in the principal focus and goals of The Rossetti Archive-moving it, in fact, from an editorial project per se to a machine for ing the nature of textuality in more general and theoretical ways. The character of the two initial lATH projects-The Rossetti Archive and Ayers's frillley of the Shadow-would exert a continuing influence on the direction of lATH's work in general. Both projects operated with large datasets of textual and visual materials. In addition, the texts in these projects were often handled both as alphanumeric data and as digital images. The image-based approach to the data was especially marked in The Rossetti Archive because, of course, Rossetti was not only a painter and visual artist; he was a poet who wrote under a horizon of book design and book illustration. But what precisely was involved in The Rossetti Archive's image-based approach to its materials? I can pose this question now because the hindsight of seven years has exposed how loosely and unselfconsciously we undertook our work with digital images. To unpack the import of that question is to begin exposing all the issues and problems that are the subjects of this book. The Rossetti Archive was conceived within the context of a technological tradition that stretches across more than two millennia. I speak of the period when scroll, book, and other textual instruments were developed as tools for communication, information storage, and critical reflection. Perhaps the most sophisticated of these machines were the ones invented and refined by so-called textual scholars: text machines-the best known being the book-for preserving and studying forms of cultural memory, including texts themselves. The Rossetti Archive was undertaken as a practical effort to design a model for scholarly editing that would have wide applicability and that would synthesize the functions of the two chief models for such works: the critical edition (for analyzing the historical relations of a complex set of descendant texts with a view toward locating accumulated linguistic error); and the facsimile edition (a rigorously faithful reproduction of a particular text, usually a rare work, for scholarly access and study). The purpose of marrying these two kinds of scholarly instruments was based in a theory of textuality that was seriously underdeveloped 20 years ago. The theory holds two positions: first, that the apparitions of text-its paratexts, bibliographical codes, and all visual features-are as important in the

12

Radiant Textuality

text's signifying programs as the linguistic elements; second, that the social intercourse of texts-the context of their relations-must be conceived an essential part of the "text itself" if one means to gain an adequate critical grasp of the textual situation. 11 That view of texts and the textual condition explains why the initial conception of The Rossetti Archive took shape well before we began our actual work on the project. In fact it came around 1983, when I was teaching at California Institute of Technology. That year I published A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism, which was the first in a series of works aimed at dislocating certain theories of textuality that dominated scholars' conceptions of their two principal disciplinary tasks: textual editing and textual interpretation. That same year I was introduced to UNIX computing systems and to hypermedia. With the convergence of these twain I knew that when circumstances were right I would undertake building a computerized hypermedia model for scholarly editing. Building the archive would articulate a powerful argument for the view of textuality I wanted to promote. The chance arrived when lATH arrived. We spent the year from 1992 to 1993 theorizing the methodology of the project and designing its logical structure. Then in 1993 we built the first small demonstration model of The Rossetti Archive, which at that time I described in the following general terms:
Like the work of Blake, Burns, and other important artists and writers, Dante Gabriel Rossetti's work is difficult to access or to edit for access. Expressive forms that work in or with visual and auditional materials do not lend themselves to the paper-based formats of traditional scholarship. Under such conditions, a more flexible medium is required. TI,e Rossetti Archive has been developed in response to this situation. The scholarly models it builds have a particular applicability to artists and writers who seek to exploit and explore the expressive potential of more than one medium. We have been especially interested in developing critical tools for studying visual materials, as well as textual materials with a significant "visible" component. Concentrating on the linguistic codes of textualities, readers and even scholars regularly give scant attention to the physique of texts. But all texts deploy a more or less complex series of bibliographical codes, and page design-if not page ornament and graphic illustration-is a rich scene of textual expression. Computerized tools that deploy hypermedia networks and digitization have the means to study visual materials and the visibilities of language in ways that have not been possible before. This archive was built to harness

Beginning Again: Humanities and Digital Culture, 1993-2000
those capabilities, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti was chosen because the diversity of his work puts the goals of such a project to a serious test. Rossetti's work was executed in two different media, visual and textual, and his work in each is intimately-and often explicitly-interconnected. The relations are clearest, perhaps, in those works where he made pictures for poems or other texts he had already written-like "The Blessed Damozel"-or in works where he made texts to accompany or comment upon pictures he had executed-for example, the sonnets he wrote as extensions of the meaning of his first important painting, Tire Girlhood of Mary Virgin. That basic complexity in Rossetti's work gets deepened and elaborated because of the centrality of Rossetti's work in recovering the poetic culture of the "Early Italian Poets" of the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries. The connections between Rossetti's so-called original work, both written and pictorial, and his translations of Dante and his circle are pervasive. Finally, Rossetti's work habits were such that these structural complexities of his art and writing get vastly extended. Rossetti was an obsessive reviser of his written work, and these revisions were carried out at every level of the writing: He worked and reworked words, phrases, passages, and he rearranged "finished" units into dizzying sets of variant organizational units. The difficulties come into sharp relief as soon as one considers any of Rossetti's works: say, the 1870 Poems; or "The House of Life," which was a subunit in that volume; or the introductory "Sonnet" to "The House of Life," which first appeared as part of the sonnet-sequence of "The House of Life" only in 1881. Rossetti followed the same kind of revisionary habits when he was painting and drawing. All these features of Rossetti's work pose a complex and hitherto unsolvable editorial problem. One cannot properly study or appreciate Rossetti's work without having access to all of it. Even an introductory selection presents serious difficulties, because one needs to combine two media together and one also needs to present the materials so that the complex relations of all the parts are preserved. One easily understands why Rossetti's work has never been comprehensively edited and why the separate parts of his work are themselves available for general study only in the most limited ways. Virginia Surtees's standard catalogue of The Paintings and Drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti is excellent but quite incomplete. And to this day the "standard" edition of the writings is the 1911 The H1Jrks of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, edited by Rossetti's brother, William Michael. The writings have never been critically edited. As a result. their nervous structural features can only be encountered in scholarly periodicals and monographs.

13

14

Radiant Textuality
A hypermedia computerized environment allows one to overleap these problems, which are a function of editing that has to be carried out in the framework of the book. In The Rossetti Archive all the works are available for study in facsimiles of their original documentary forms. This means that the user has access to all his original manuscripts, printed texts, drawings, designs, and paintings. Since Rossetti designed his own books, one can appreciate the importance of reading his work in its original documentary states. And since the archive preserves these original materials in full color facsimile as necessary, one can see the great advance computerization makes in this case over Surtees's catalogue (which reproduces Rossetti's images in black and white). Furthermore, computerization allows the editor to connect all of Rossetti's documents to each other so that their relationships can be examined and better understood. Finally, these authorial materials are embedded in a context of related documents, historical and critical, that help to illuminate the primary materials as well as their cultural context. The archive has incorporated, for example, various contemporary materials that are important for understanding Rossetti, pre-Raphaelitism, and the world in which they emerged and developed. The archive has included The Germ, William Michael Rossetti's early biography of his brother, as well as William Michael's 1911 edition of the works, H. C. Marillier's and Frederick Stephens's commentaries on the art, and other crucial contemporary documents (Swinburne, Buchanan, Pater, etc.). Also included is a large corpus of the photographs by which Rossetti's work was disseminated. As the archive is further developed, this body of material will be expanded. It is all marked for full electronic search and analysis. It is also supplemented by the present editor's critical essays, notes, and commentaries. The latter, of course, draw upon the considerable corpus of scholarship and criticism that has evolved over the past century on Rossetti, his circle, and their general historical milieu. (http://jefferson.village. virginia.edu/rossetti/introduction.html)

One can easily see, from this later vantage, how well that description reflects the state of humanities computing in 1993, when the TEl implementation of SGML markup was beginning to take serious hold, when hypermedia models were gaining widespread attention, and when W3 was scattering text and image constructions of many kinds across the globe.

Beginning Again
Because The Rossetti Archive was conceived and pursued, early on, as much as a kind of thought experiment in the theory of texts as an editorial project per se, it kept a constant focus on reflexive attention. I refer not only to the standard and highly pragmatic critical processes that regulate the design and building of any kind of tool or instrument. Of course we were constantly constructing the archive, testing what we had implemented, modifying what we had done, and then rescaling the level of implementation. Beyond those critical operations, however, the archive held our interest as a theoretical instrument for investigating the nature of textuality as such. This inertia in the project broke out as a series of related texts. I wrote these reflexive pieces between 1993 and 2000 as expositions and critiques of our work, and all but one, the dialogue on "The Alice Fallacy," were originally published as online research reports. Writing the first set of these pieces between 1993 and 1996 brought a new level of clarity to what we were doing; and one of these, "Imagining What You Don't Know: The Theoretical Goals of The Rossetti Archive:' marked a turning point in the project as a whole. It argues that to make anything is also to make a speculative foray into a concealed but wished for unknown. The thing made is not the achievement of one's desire; it is the shadow of that desire, the sign of what the poet spoke of as "something longed for, never seen." Writing that essay ushered the project of the archive to a new level of operation. It also initiated the project of this book: that is to say, the decision to draft careful written records of the critical stages in the making of the archive. The work of those writings has been recomposed into the parts of this book, which is organized around a double vanishing point. In one perspective appears a set of related but independent explorations into the characteristics of different kinds of textualities. In another, one follows a kind of metanarrative or critical history projecting a map of future scholarly operations. We begin to explore that relatively unentered territory in the final section of the book, where the project of The Rossetti Archive mutates into an entirely different set of critical and scholarly demands. These demands arise naturally-this is now clear, as it was not clear in 1993-from the way in which the project was first conceived. As a model constructed to reflect on its own process of development, the archive proved acutely sensitive in two directions at the same time: to changes taking place in the encompassing field of digital media, and to the traditional

16

Radiant Textuality

needs of humanities scholars working out of paper-based models of textuality. Because W3 browsers had just become available, John Unsworth urged me to build the first model of the archive in HTML for web dissemination. Doing that was essentially an act of handicraft, for in 1993 we were primarily involved in discussions about how to design an SGML structure for all of The Rossetti Archive's materials, visual as well as textual. The latter was to be a complex logical structure-in contrast to the HTML-marked demonstration model. One wants to hold this initial situation clearly in mind, for the contradiction between the web demo model, a simple visual interface built in HTML, and the archive itself, a set of logical relations and determinants conceived in SGML, would surface repeatedly in all our work. Briefly, then: As we built the archive we kept encountering variations on a pair of difficulties. Both are functions of the special character of '/J:umanities materials, which are not primarily informational materials. They are made for reflective and imaginative purposes-in Rossetti's case, textual and visual works made for such purposes. Hence came our recurrent set of difficulties. First, neither the SGML markup structure nor the lhypermedia design were able to integrate the textual and visual materials 'beyond elementary connecting, sorting, and gathering operations. 12 Second, the archive's principal objects of study-Rossetti's works-were not being interpretively exposed by the computational tools in very interesting ways. Computerization made much more information (and much more varied information) available-vast amounts of data in forms, relational as well as facsimile, that were previously unimaginable. As a tool for rethinking these materials, however, whether through structured or randomized searches of the data, the computer continually disappointed the high hopes it had raised. The archive includes a great deal of critical and reflexive materials in itself, but these materials are simply linked to the primary materials in an elementary, if also elaborate and complex, hypertext organization. Nothing illustrates the practico-theoretical weakness of this situation more dramatically than the brave new world of hyperfiction. Armed as they are with remarkable technical resources, the works of this new genre pale in complexity before their paper ancestors: early works like The Metamorphoses, The Arabian Nights, The Saragossa Manuscript, or recent ones by Joyce, Riding Jackson, Borges, and of course the whole OULIPO contingent and its numerous contemporary offipring. The example of hyperfiction may well locate a temporary condition.

We have no reason to doubt-indeed, we have every reason to expectthat remarkable imaginative works will appear in digital forms. Traditional imaginative texts developed and mutated over a long period of time and in many different environments. Hyperfiction and video games are early explorations and experiments, and if they seem primitive next to analogous works we inherit through predigital traditions, the same cannot be said of digital art, which has already developed sophisticated forms. Success in this case comes, of course, because digital imaging procedures feed upon the rich fund of electronic media that has emerged over the past hundred and more years. Traditional textualities have not been in a position to such media until very recently. I bring up these matters not to pass out digital merits and demerits to people working in different areas of the arts and humanities but to locate that part of the field where we have advanced hardly at all-indeed, where we have made few serious efforts to advance. More than anything else, the making of The Rossetti Archive has exposed the gulf that stands between digital tools and media, on one hand, and the regular practices of traditional philosophy, "theory," hermeneutics, and arts/literary/cultural criticism, on the other. Digital culture is virtually (!) an obsessional topic in all these fields, but it is a topic addressed from a distance, as a kind of fascinating and/or threatening alien form. That distance gets marked with unmistakable clarity in one way: the discursive procedures in all of these fields remain to date resolutely Works like The Rossetti Archive or The or Ti,e Dickens J.1Ieb are fundamentally archival and editorial. 1 They gather, sort, and make things accessible, and they link these things to related things. Unlike works imagined and organized in bibliographical forms, however, these new textual environments have yet to develop operational structures that integrate their archiving and editorial mechanisms with their critical and reflective functions at the foundational level of their material form, that is, at the digital/computational level. Although structural coding in SGML (or XML) mitigates this deficiency to a certain degree, it is not only difficult and time-consuming to implement, but its principles and other design characteristics set permanent and unacceptable limits on its usefulness with arts and humanities materials. Thus, however primitive hyperfiction and video games may seem, we recognize their functional relation to their underlying digital processes. In this respect they are more advanced in a practico-theoretical point of view than any of the IT-based scholarly works mentioned above. This is particularly the case with video games. The difference implicitly traced in this discussion, between the

18

Radiant Textuality

scholar/ editor, on one hand, and the critic/philosopher, on the other, was once far less sharply drawn than it is in our day. In ages and circumstances when hardly any distinction pertained between works of criticism/reflection and works of art/imagination-cultural conditions that produced the Bible, The &ok of Odes, Mahabarata, and the works of Sophocles, Aeschylus, Lucretius, and Dante--the work of scholarship and learning was also much more integrated. Jerome, Augustine, Aquinas, Politian: All were figures of immense cultural authority. But then came the worlds of J. G. Eichhorn and G. W. F. Hegel and, later, Karl Lachmann and Friedrich Nietzsche. Two of those four names are forgotten except among circles of textual specialists; two maintain their cultural celebrity. That difference marks a notable shift in social and historical circumstances that has occurred during the past 200 years. Our digital culture is likely to reverse that difference. A hundred years from now, which of the following two names is likely to remain pertinent to traditions of critical thinking and which will seem merely quaint, if it is recalled at all outside pedantic circles: Vannevar Bush, Harold Bloom? For historical scholars of any kind, figures like Bloom index a serious disciplinary and cultural crisis. The digital revolution has pushed us to the brink of a great age of editorial and archival scholarship. This is plain to see--if one cares to look at all. For the past 200 years, however, the central work of cultural reflection and criticism has grown increasingly divorced from that kind of editorial scholarship. Nietzsche's critique of philology and historicist method marks the point at which the original rapprochement between what philologists called the "Lower Criticism" and the "Higher Criticism" was destroyed. In our day the authority of this Nietzschean break has greatly diminished. Modern computational tools are extremely apt to execute one of the two permanent functions of scholarly criticism-the editorial and archival function, the remembrance of things past. So great is their aptitude in this foundational area that we stand on the edge of a period that will see the complete editorial transformation of our inherited cultural archive. That event is neither a possibility nor a likelihood; it is a certainty. As it emerges around us, it exposes our need for critical tools of the same material and formal order that can execute our other permanent scholarly function: to imagine what we don't know in a disciplined and deliberated fashion. How can digital tools be made into prosthetic extensions of that demand for critical reflection? This is not a question to be addressed in speculative or conceptual terms. To count as adequate today, in this culture, responses to the question-most especially theoretical responses-require the deploy-

19

ment of computational instruments. Paper-based forms like this book can now, I think, only come to assist in a process of exploration and study that will henceforth be determined by digital forms. The next generation of literary and aesthetic theorists who will most matter are people who will be at least as involved with making things as with writing text. These kinds of issues won't be usefully engaged without reconsidering certain fundamental problems of texts and textuality. The critical possibilities of digital environments require that we revisit what we know, or what we think we know, about the formal and material properties of the codex. We shall see that the advent of digital tools promotes this kind of critical reflection and leads to a view of books and of language itself that breaks with many common and widely held ideas. We shall see how, in a pragmatic as well as a theoretical perspective, the normative form of language is most usefully approached not as informational and expository but as poetic and polyvalent. Though informational and expository models of language have been taken as normative for more than three centuries, they are in fact specialized models, sophisticated derivatives. They were installed to facilitate certain instrumental tasks. We shall also see how texts deploy complex visible codes-how printed pages function both in seman tical and imagistic ways-and how the executable codes (algorithms) of computational devices have much to tell us about the functioning structures of traditional textual devices. Finally, we shall trace in these investigations the discovery of a graduated series of critical moves that were generating unapparent consequences. These mutate under different topical conditions and then get reinvested as new critical opportunities. The completed form of this essentially stochastic critical process comes in the final section of this book. At that point we layout a model for a procedure of critical thinking that calls for digital implementation. This model appears in "The Ivanhoe Game," whose origins lie in the concealed pressures that drive and sustain the more immediate reflexive goals of this book's purely textual investigations. The game, which is procedural and structured for random turns of event, will be formally described, its prehistory will be documented, and its digital existence forecast.

Rethinking Textuality

There are some ':features" of the real world that are better lost in translation. Perhaps the idea of a document having a single location is one of them. -Steven Johnson, Interface Culture

A

s we have seen over and over again, complex problems emerge when you try to think about digital media through our inherited codex paradigms or vice versa. The collision of these two marking systems-for that is ultimately what they are-came up repeatedly in our conversations about one of Johanna Drucker's central concerns-what she calls "The Metalogics of the Book."l That subject shifted into useful focus when Drucker and I undertook a simple experiment with an OCR scanner. The point of the experiment was to use computer hardware to demonstrate what our thought experiments kept suggesting to us: that the rationale of a textualized document is an ordered ambivalence and that this ambivalence can be seen functioning at the document's fundamental graphic levels. By "rationale" we mean the dynamic structure of a document as it is realized in determinate (artisanal) and determinable (reflective) ways. By "ordered ambivalence" we mean the signifying differentials set in play when a rhetoric of intention is applied to a document. Textual differentials at any level are a function of the effort to control or even eliminate them. 2 The implications of this demonstration are, we believe, considerable. For our own special field of interest-the study of literary, cultural, and aesthetic works, and especially those deploying textual elements-the demonstration brings a strong argument for the following ideas:

138

Radiant Textuality

(l)a. That what we call "a text" should be understood as a document composed of both seman tical and graphical signifying parts. J b. That the heuristic distinction between bibliographic and semantic elements obscures the field of textual meaning by identifying the signifying field (its "rationale") with the semantic field. (2)a. That there is no such thing as an unmarked text, and the markup systems laid upon documents to facilitate computerized analyses are marking orders laid upon already marked up material. (Thus all texts implicidy record a cultural history of their artifactuality.) b. That while we recognize how the semantic elements of any given document encode a record of those elements' historical passage, the same is true of the text's bibliographical elements. (3)a. That marked text, a document, is interpreted text. b. That text documents, while coded bibliographically and semantically, are all marked graphically. c. That the distinction between graphic and bibliographic textual features stands as an index of the text's archaeological condition in both its semantic and its bibliographical orders. d. That marking any textual distinction-for example, between bibliographic and semantic elements-is a high order interpretive operation. e. That distinctions may be marked for attention or for inattention. (So the interpretive procedure, now prevalent, that does not "reveal the codes" of its bibliographical rationale has marked them for inattention.) (4)a. That texted documents are not containers of meaning or data but sets of rules (algorithms) for generating themselves: for discovering, organizing, and utilizing meanings and data. b. That since the demise of classical rhetorical theory and the emergence of advertising, bibliographical codes constitute a text's clearest display of its generative rules. c. That these rules-the rationale of the texted document--are necessarily ambiguous because the rules are being repeatedly reread (i.e .· executed), whether the reader is conscious of this or not. d. That the marked text, as a record of its historical passage. is ipso facto a record of its previous readings, that is to say, its generative rules. e. That the rules of marked text-the descriptive/performative protocolscan be made apparent (rendered visible) as such through another marking program. (But many of these rules, now so historically remote, will have become too obscure to recover.) (5). That a certain class of texts-poetical texts, so called--are normative for

Rethinking Textuality

139

all textual documents because their generic rationale is to maximize atten-

tion to the structure and interplay of the textual orders.

Understand that as we undertook our experiment this sequence of ideas had reached only the loosest state of articulation. Several were altogether unformulated at the beginning of our work, and at this point some are hypotheses for guiding our planned work. They emerged in a determinate form only after some months of preliminary theoretical conversations and initial experiments. A dialectical/experimental process came to clarify and unpack these inchoate ideas and direct the process of exploration. Nevertheless, I place them here so that you can follow and assess the adequacy of what we're doing and why we came to these first conclusions.

The Initial Experimental Context
The project began out of a general dissatisfaction with two approaches to textuality and text interpretation that have great authority in the community of literary and linguistic scholars. One, a recent power, gained its position with the emergence of humanities computing. The logical system of text markup developed for computers, SGML, fully represents this view. This hypergrammar treats its documentary materials as organized information, and it chooses to determine the system of organization as a hierarchy of nested elements; or, in the now well-known formulation: "text is an ordered hierarchy of content objects" (the so-called OHCO thesis). This approach to textuality only became problematic when it was undertaken and then implemented by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEl), as several of its principal advocates pointed out in 1993: "the experience of the text encoding community, as represented and codified by the TEl Guidelines, has raised difficulties for the [OHCO] thesis."4 As we know, TEl set about formulating a special subset of SGML that would be useful, in its view, for encoding cultural documents (as opposed to business and administrative documents) for computerized search and analysis. TEl is now a standard for humanities encoding practices. Because it treats the humanities corpus-typically, works of imagination-as informational structures, it ipso facto violates some of the most basic reading practices of the humanities community, scholarly as well as popular. The revulsion that many humanists express for the emergence of digital technology reflects this sense that computerized models are alien things:

140

, Radiant Textua"i!y

practice as such, then certainly alien to the received inheritance of and art. This traditional community of readers comprises the second group to which our project is critically addressed. For this group textual interpretation (as opposed to text management and organization) is the central concern. In this community of readers, the very idea of a "standard generalized markup," which is to say a standard generalized interpretation, is either problematic or preposterous. The issue hangs upon the centrality of the poetical or imaginative text for cultural scholars, though it applies equally well to students of art, history, anthropology, politics, law, and any discipline in which procedural rules of interpretation are perceived as more or less context-based, flexible, manipulable: "reader" or" community" organizeddialectical-rather than structurally fixed. But while our specific project consciously addressed this duplex audience-each at once a set of adversaries and a set of comrades-it became a practical focus only after a set of (so to speak) prehistorical events had unfolded. Here I speak only for myself, not for Johanna Drucker, who at the time (1992-1993) was working elsewhere and whom I did not know, though I knew her work pretty well. The determinate matter here is the project of The Rossetti Archive. As we have seen, this came about in late 1993, about seven years after I had first encountered computerized technology and hypermedia methodology during my tenure at Caltech. At that time I knew I would undertake a project like the archive should the chance arrive. This was a clear decision based on the idea that a hypermedia "edition" or "archive" would make it possible to study literary and aesthetic works in entirely new ways. The innovative possibilities were, in my view, not just a function of the computational resource of these new tools. Two other matters interested me more. First, digital imaging resources offered hopes that students would be able to carry out their studies in a more direct relation to primary documentary materials. This was important to me because my previous work as an editor of such materials had shown me that what traditional interpretation sought as "meaning" in a text was always deeply funded in a text's material features-its "bibliographical codes:' now so called. Second, I was struck by the mterpretlve opporfumdes released in those relational organizations fostered by computerization: hypertext and hypermedia. When we began building The Rossetti Archive in 1993, I was introduced to SGML and TEl as tools for enhancing the analytic power of the archive's resources. The usefulness of these tools became apparent fairly quickly and so with the help of some people who had a deep understand-

if not alien to

Rethinking Textuality

141

ing of logical markup forms, we created a specialized version of SGML to organize the data in the archive. Then followed seven years of practical implementations of our initial plans and ideas. These were years filled with those splendid, even ravishing enlightenments that only come when your plans and ideas are thwarted and overthrown. "In a dark time," as Theodore Roethke famously wrote, "the eye begins to see." So, as we proceeded with the practical construction of the archive we began to see the hidden fault lines of its design structure. As I've already pointed out, what began as a project to put out a certain product-an image-based design for electronic editing that would have wide applicability-bifurcated. Our initial purpose acquired a new one: to use the archive's process of construction as a laboratory for reflecting on the project itself. That second purpose led inevitably to a regular set of critical inquiries into the basic organizing ideas of the archive and its procedures. This new set of interests inevitably delayed the appearance of the archive itself-a frustrating event in certain respects but immensely fruitful in others. One result of these new interests is Drucker's "Metalogics of the Book" project. In my case the project emerged directly from a reflection on three types of problem that the building of the archive exposed. The first, which I've already noted, involved the weaknesses in "the OHCO thesis" of textuallty that we found when implementing the The second centered in the way we were handling digital images. That is to say, the archive's logical design had no means for integratmg these objects into an anarather, the failure to consider interface in lytic structure. Finally, a serious way-constituted yet a third problem. This last case was in certain respects the most interesting as well as the most surprising. For when we worked out the archive's original design, we deliberately chose to focus on the logical structure and to set aside any thought about the Interface for delivering the archive to its users. We made this decision in order to avoid committing ourselves prematurely to a delivery mechanism. The volatile character of interface software appeared so extreme that we determined to proceed in such a way that, when we were ready to deliver the work, we would have a product that could be accommodated to whatever software seemed best.
The Rewards of Failure

'-1

A great virtue of computerized tools is that they are simple. Consequently, to get them to perform their operations you have to make your instructions explicit and unambiguous. To do that means you have to be very clear

142

Radiant Textuality

in your own mind about what you're thinking, meaning, intending. The simplicity of the computer is merciless. It will expose every jot and tittle of your thought's imprecisions. What I've just said is news to no one. It is a banality. But we want to remember that time when we thought differendy about computers and about cognitive precision. The recollection is important here because it will help to clarify our project. Here is my recollection circa 1983. Introduced to UNIX multitasking and to the possibilities of digital hypermedia, I was drawn to my initial imagining of something like The Rossetti Archive-a critical and scholarly environment for studying aesthetic works in novel and hitherto impossible ways. When the chance came some ten years later actually to build such a work, I thought I had come to the Promised Land. It was Middlearth after all, I would soon realize. But in fact also a land of promise, although promising in a way I had not expected. The simplifying rigors characteristic of digital systems have not been prized by humanities scholars for a long time. They are associated with disambiguated scientific-or at least scientistic-thinking. Humanities scholars pledge their allegiance to a different kind of rigor and precision. Or so we have always said. But what is that kind of precision, precisely? Responding to that question is a primary, and in all likelihood longterm, goal of the "Metalogics of the Book" experiment. Our general goal is to study how digital tools fail to render or realize complex forms of imaginative works (the works of Rossetti, for instance). The purpose, however, is not to "correct" these "failures" but to try to understand their significance and meaning. So we're trying to use computational operations not to realize our purposes and ideas but to derealize them, as it were. Why do we want this? Because our subjects of interest are works that realize themselves not in standardized and disambiguated forms but through their active relation to such forms. This relation shows why computerization can only realize imperfecdy and imprecisely the projects qlost dear to scholars who study imaginative works. The problem does not lie "in" the computers but in the strategies of those who design them. This inevitable dysfunction, however, is no reason at all to dismiss computerization from the principal research interests of humanities scholars. On the contrary, these new tools offer an unprecedented opportunity for clarifying our thinking processes. Indeed, they license us to implement in more rigorous ways della Volpe's dialectical model of interpretation (see chapter 3). This project means to use computerized resources to clarify-to define

Rethinking Textuality

143

precisely-what we imagine we know about books and texts. Because our computer tools are models of what we imagine we know-they're built to our specifications-when they show us what they know they are reporting ourselves back to us.

The Experiment
Ask this question: "Can a computer be taught to read a poem?" The answer is "yes." TEl is a grammar that computers can understand and manipulate. When you mark up text you are ipso facto reading and interpreting it. A poetical text marked up in TEl has been subjected to a certain kind of interpretation. But of course sophisticated readers of poetical works recoil when such a model of reading is recommended to them. Poems are rich with nuances that regularly and, it seems, inevitably transcend TEl protocols. But suppose one were to step away from complex forms like poetry. Suppose one were to try to begin a computerized analysis of texted documents at a primitive level. The first move in this case would be to choose to "read" the document at a presemantic level. The focus would be on the document's graphical design, the latter being understood as a set of markup features comprising a reading of the document, that is, a set of protocols for negotiating the textual scene. The idea would be to construct an initial set of elementary text descriptors that would be fed to a computer. The computer would use these to parse the document and then deliver an output of what it read. Our hypothesis was that it would deliver multiple readings. This initial model for the experiment did not survive a series of critical interrogations. Conversations we had with Worthy Martin (one of our colleagues at lATH and a specialist in computer vision) exposed the difficulty of constraining the text descriptors so that we would get usable results. To do this was theoretically feasible but would take a great deal of mathematical analysis. These conversations brought another important realization: that the text primitives we were trying to articulate would comprise an elementary set of markup codes. And that understanding brought out a crucial further understanding about textuality in general: that all texts are marked texts. At this point let me quote Johanna's notes on our investigation as it then stood:

DM said that his idea of automated mark-up was not simply to insert tags identifying semantic or syntactic or content features, but to show that texts

144

Radiant Textuality

t

were already "marked" in their written form. This suggested to me the idea of the "reveal codes" command in a digital document, since it would make evident what is usually unacknowledged and unseen: the commands and protocols according to which the file is encoded. Though "reveal codes" was the first term that galvanized discussion, it was quickly evident that Jerry and [ came at it from two different directions and with two different, but curiously complementary agendas. Jerry saw "reveal codes" as an aspect of "deformance" and [ saw it as a first step in a "metalogics of the book." Thus we split from the outset between interpretation and analytic description. between a desire to create a demonstration of deformance as a mode of reading and an interrogation of book form and format as interface. In both instances. the point of commonality that links our project into one is the conviction that the graphic format of a text participates in the production of textual signification in ways that are generally unacknowledged. Our shared aim is to demonstrate this-DM leading us through experiments in computer misreading of graphic features and me trying to push the analysis of graphic form by developing a critical vocabulary for it. (Notes 1)

As we tried to relate and define more precisely our two lines of inquiry, it occurred to us that we might take advantage of the elementary reading operations carried out by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) programs. Even the best of these programs, as we knew, produced deformed readings of the documents they scanned. We therefore decided to see what could be discovered from the deformations generated by a good scanning program. We used Omnipage 10.0. We also decided to work with prose texts rather than with poetry. But the prose texts would be of two different kinds: first, a document with some complex display features, and second a relatively straightforward piece of prose formatted margin-to-margin in standard block form. We report here only on the first document.
We chose an advert page from the 20 August 1870 issue of the Victorian periodical The Athenaeum (page 256). We set the scanner at True Page/Greyscale. The plan was to run the page through several successive scannings, in this order: (1). An initial scanning; (2). A reprocessing (NOT a rescanning) of the document at exacdy the same settings and without moving the document; (3). A repetition of operation 1, that is, a rescanning of the document keeping all original settings and with the document unmoved; (4-6). A repetition of operations 1,2, and 3 but at a black and white setting; (7-12). A repetition of operations 1-6 except we would lift

Rethinking Textuality

145

the document and replace it in as nearly the same position as we could. We had other similar repetition/variation scans in mind as well, but before planning them we judged it best to assess the results of these first 12 operations. As it turned out, the results we obtained in the first two operations led us to modify these initial plans. We performed instead a second repetition of the initial scan and then went on to perform only a selection of the other operations. Operation 1. The first scanning pass produced the usual double output: a rough image highlighting the page sectors, and a standard output of the alphanumeric text. The scan produced a text divided into 21 zones plus an alphanumeric text with a series of misreadings and error messages. Operation 2. The reprocessing of the first scan produced a startling double result: the output this time divided the document into 20 zones and displayed slighdy different alphanumeric text. Operation 3. The res canning of the document produced yet further variances in both the sectoring and the alphanumeric output. This time 17 zones were distinguished and new variances appeared in the alphanumeric text. The results of operations 2 and 3 convinced us to repeat operation 3, which produced this time 18 sectors and new variances in the alphanumeric text. At this point we had results that were significant for our purposes, so we curtailed the rest of the planned experiment. We did two more rescannings: a scan at black and white settings, which reproduced the sectoring of operation 1 but output a new set of alphanumeric variances; and a rescanning after the document had been lifted and then replaced on the scanner. This operation yielded 22 sectors plus new alphanumeric variances. Several important consequences flowed from these experiments. First, we now possessed a powerful physical argument for a key principle of "textual deformance" and its founding premise: that no text is self-identical. 5 Whatever the physical "causes" of the variant readings, and however severely one sought to maintain the integrity of the physical operation, it appeared that variance would remain a possibility. Second, the OCR experiments showed that textual ambivalence can be located and revealed at graphical, presemantic levels. This demonstration is important if one Wishes to explore the signifying value of the bibliographical codes of a textual document. For it is a commonplace in both the SGML/TEI and the hermeneutic communities that these codes do not signify in the way that semantic codes do. Third, the experiments strongly suggested that while every text possesses, as it were, a self-parsing markup, the reading of that markup can only be executed by another parsing agent. That is to say, there can be no such

146

Radiant Textuality

thing as an "unread" text. (And while the experiments did nothing to argue for the following conviction, it remains strong with both of us: that every text" contains within itself," so to speak, a more or less obscured history of the readings/parsings, both semantic and bibliographical, that transmit the document to any immediate moment of reading/parsing.)
The Present Situation

Out of these experiments emerged the theses I set out at the beginning of this chapter, and the issues raised through the theses have set Drucker and myself on a pair of new courses. First, here are Drucker's notes for developing 4D interface design models.
Rather than visualizing the thematic/semantic contents of a text in abstract form I now want to be sure to map it into a visualized spatialization of the book. Thinking of the book as a space, one that also unfolds along the vA'emporal axis (or axes) of reading, I can envision a 4-d model of the book. In this model every graphic element is actually a structuring element. Thus, for instance, a table of contents is not a simple notation lying on a thin sheet in the front matter, but is means of dividing the sculptural form of the book into a set of discrete spaces, each demarcated in relation to that original point of spatial reference, and located relationally within the whole. This sounds terribly empirical, I know, and insofar as I am interested in describing an object in material, schematic, and logical terms, I intend for it to suggest a faith in what Worthy calls "the properties of things themselves." I would stop short of any suggestion that these are "self-identical" properties, or that a specific signification inheres in these properties, or that there might a lexicon of values attached to such properties. Instead, I suggest that as organizing schemata, these format features function as an integral portion of t e text because they function as an interface. In a several stage process, I want to make a visualized model of a book, a wire-frame image of its format features down to their specifics and particularities, and then flow the text through that so that semantically/syntactically tagged features can be displayed (why? first to see what patterns figure forth from such a demonstration, and second, to be able to morph this displayas another act of deformance). ]M suggests a second form in this model, a second "book" that would emerge as an image of the discourse of reading, the trace of intercourse of reader and text. This begins to suggest the holographic projection of my original graph of deformance as a space between discourse and reference.

Rethinking Textuality

147

Now I see that that space is in fact the space of reading-with reading defined as deformance. (Notes 7)

This new project intends to deepen the exploration of the "nature" of paper-based documents. And while my work with The Rossetti Archive "as a theoretical pursuit" has been directed almost exclusively in that direction for the past five years, 6 1 am beginning to see a need to clarify the critical possibilities of digital environments and tools at the user end. So the following questions begin to pose themselves. First: what practical difference does it make to understand documents as "difference engines"? At one time we thought (I think) that a person might usefully engage in "endless play" with "the text;' but the tediousness of such a thought is now apparent to (nearly) everyone. It is the dead-end of our 150o-year experiment with the game of silent reading. The game will probably never cease to have its charms, but it is a game now often spinning the wheels of its own conventions. (That is the "meaning" of a work like If on a Winter's Niglu a Traveller [Calvino], though I should add that since Poe the meaning has been as available as the purloined letter.) Second: what good are cybertools for elucidating these difference engines? Those two questions will be addressed in a practical way by asking two other questions: What use-functions distinguish cybertext from docutext? And (how) might any of those functions promote our appreciation of texts as difference engines?

A Brief Digression
Some of the most reliable promoters of cybertext-whether critical (like Espen Aarseth) or inspirational (like Janet Murray)-have themselves, 1 think, obscured the issues. Murray, for example, distinguishes four central properties of digital environments: two interactive properties (procedural, participatory); and two immersive properties (spatial, encyclopedic) (Murray 71-90). It can be shown, however, that none of these properties are peculiar to digital environments. They are even essential properties of the docutexts that control the way Murray thinks about digital tools. Her interest is in fictional narrative, and if one thinks seriously about such narratives one easily sees that these four properties characterize their operational status. This fact is most apparent from Murray's own book, for when she introduces her view of the digital environment, she uses a number of paper-based works she calls "Harbingers of the Holodeck." All of her harbingers are recent, but the truth is that these harbingers go far back-the

148

Radiant Textuality

I

Bible being one of the most apparent. Murray chooses recent ones in order to seduce us into thinking these environments are recent phenomena. But they aren't, as book scholars have often pointed out to cyberiots. Aarseth has proposed an elaborate taxonomy for texts in general in order to construct a distinctive set of criteria for understanding what he wants to call "cybertexts." Unlike Murray, Aarseth recognizes that books have "dynamic" functions and hence that "new [cybernetic] media do not appear in opposition to the old [paper media] but as emulators of features and functions that are already invented" (Aarseth 74). Despite this remark, however, Aarseth makes a sharp distinction between what he calls "linear" and "ergodic" texts and he locates "ordinary text"-including "hyper"ordinary texts---on the linear side of the distinction. Cybertexts, by contrast, are "ergodic" in that they have dynamic user-function(s) beyond the purely interpretive function common to all texts (Aarseth 62-67). (He distinguishes three other user functions: explorative, configurative, and textonic, the last signifying the user's ability to add permanent traversal functions to the text.) Useful as Aarseth's study is, however, he too,like Murray, misconstrues . "ordinary text" as "linear." One does not have to recall Mesoamerican quipu or any number of ideographical texts to recognize the nonlinear character of various kinds of precybertexts. 7 Every poem comprised in our inherited Western corpus could fairly be described as a nonlinear game played (largely) with linear forms and design conventions, but often with nonlinear forms as well. Nonverbal texts are useful to consider in this context because they highlight the sociohistorical nature of "linear textuality." Epitomized by documents constructed from alphanumeric characters and by a "clockwork" temporality, even the most abstract linear texts contain residues of nonlinear semiotic functions and relations. The residues appear when textual spaces are treated as maps, when algorithms of traversal are deployed (as with glosses, footnotes, and such), or when the form taken by scripts and typefaces functions rhetorically (operates beyond an abstract and transparent informational function). C. S. Peirce's turn-of-the-century effort to replace the alphanumeric text with what he called existential graphs in order to achieve a greater range and clarity of logical exposition is an extremely important event in the history of Western textuality. The graphs were an effort to develop a language for nonlinear relations. 8

Aarseth's and Murray's views about the differences between traditional and cyber textualities are common and widely accepted. That fact underscores

Rethinking Textuality

the need for a thoroughgoing retheorization of our ideas about books and traditional textuality in general. Since our immediate purpose is to "rethink textuality" in relation to digital resources, we will settle for something much more modest at this point. Three points are especially important. First, we want to recover a clear sense of the rhetorical character of traditional text. Rhetoric exposes what texts are doing in saying what they say. It is fundamentally "algorithmic." Secondly, we want to remember that textual rhetoric operates at the material level of the text-that is to say, through its bibliographical codes. Both matters are crucial if we are to build digital tools that can exploit the resources of traditional texts. Finally, we have to preserve a clear sense of the relation of those two features of traditional text and the inherendy differential, underdetermined character of textual works. Texts are not self-identical, but their ambiguous character-this is especially clear in poetical texts-functions in very precise and determinate ways. Of first importance is the analysis of the elemental formality that makes text possible: textspace, or the confmes that invite the appearance of text in any form at all. We think of this as some kind of pagespace or its equivalent, but in fact text can be entertained in spaces whose elements are distributed in linear or nonlinear arrangements, or both. In the case of nonlinear, the topology may be open or closed (a cave wall, say, versus a bowl, a vase, a knife, etc.). Those spaces represent different executable programs for the deployment of text. If we think in terms of pagespace exclusively, the formal options for deploying text (or text plus shapes, or text plus shapes and/or images) are both complex and determinate. Any given pagespace could be analyzed for its textual deployment rules, and one could also go on to layout a higher order set of rules for pagespace in general-a set that would be generalized from an inductive study of a comprehensive body of documentary instances. The atomic documentary unit of any pagespace would be a textual mark, that is to say, an alphanumeric or a syllabic (or perhaps an ideographic) mark along with the space that has interpellated the mark. That unit of marked space can then generate, through rule-governed procedures, the higher-order textual constructions that are available within pagespace. is only pardy distinguished in such documentary terms, however. For one thing, those terms are purely formal ones and say nothing about the generative capabilities of a textual document considered with respect to its materialities (whether semantic or linguistic). For another, although the formal structure of pagespace is planar and two-dimensional, the forms of pagespace can be made to generate themselves through n-dimensional orders (see chapter 7). Furthermore, beyond the documentary state of the text stand many other rule-governed orders of textuality-rules of grammar, rhetoric,

150

genre, and their subsets of rules. And informational as opposed to poetic texts illustrate a crucial generic distinction, as everyone knows. Those two great genres proliferate through numerous subgenres that are framed by coded instructions. Any given textual form represents a complex set of transactional codes written for simultaneous and/or sequential execution. In all these cases we are considering what texts are doing in saying what they say. I have deliberately kept the analysis from considering any more complex, higher-order types of textual performatives-for instance, from considering the ideological dimension of textuality, which is perhaps the one area of textuality where injunctive processes have drawn regular-if not especially rigorous-critical attention. The point is to keep the form of the analysis as sharply defined as possible so that we can get a clear view of the rhetorical scene at a general level, because the complexity of textspace and its coding options are very great. Let's shift, then, from these spatial grammatologies to consider textuality in terms of the lexicon. Any textspace can, in the abstract, deploy any lexicon. But in fact any text coded into any textspace brings with it certain discursive instructions, that is, certain rules that delimit the discourse(s) being deployed in the textspace. Bakhtin's celebrated discussions of textual heteroglossia reference in a general way this discursive structure for fictional texts. Or consider the brief opening chapter of G. Spencer Brown's lAws of Form (1969), where a discourse drawn from the (closely related) lexicons of logic and mathematics is being deployed. 9 What is important to rememberWittgenstein forced us to this recollection, remember?-is that semantic materials are not units of atomized meaning. They are parts of a language game-more than that, they are instantiated instructions for playing a certain language game in a certain time and place for certain particular purposes. That truth about text was first brought home to me years ago in Chicago. I and some of my students interested in poetry used to playa game with brief texts of verse. One person would choose a short and more or less obscure poem (unknown to the others), break it down into an alphabetized list of its constituent words (including the number of times any word appeared in the poem), and then give the list to other persons in the group. The game was to construct a poem from the list of words. Playing the game we soon discovered that our reconstructed poems were often uncannily similar to each other; more, they seemed borne along by a kind of fate back towards the original poem. We then changed the game and made our object the reconstruction of the original (unknown) poem from the given word lists. We gave up the game when it became obvious that we could do these reconstructions-not because we were especially clever, but because (a) we

Rethitlkitlg Textuality

151

could access the discourse of poetry in various dialects, and (b) the word lists represented brief excerpts of a complete language game. The apparent randomness of the lists comprised a second order illusion that threw into relief the coded character of the original texts. We weren't dealing with code and output. Everything was code and output simultaneously. Implicit in this discussion is the (theoretical) possibility, long cherished by structural linguists, of deducing the rules for writing the codes that generate traditional text output. In my view such an effort would be most usefully pursued toward broadly semiotic, rather than more restricted linguistic, codes because the latter depend for their operation on a Oogically prior) semiotic space. Besides, that space, being more primitive, displays textual laws of form in structural terms that are simpler to see and read. The complexity of such a project of deduction, known to all and lamented by many, is a function of our different ways of parsing semiotic and linguistic space. To structure or analyze semiotic or linguistic space we need, we believe, some standard code for description and measurement. But such a standard code flees us for exactly the reason set out by Spencer Brown: you cannot obtain a standardized system of measurement when your acts of analysis are drawn from and make up a part of your subject of attention and inquiry. We get fixed standards-rules of naming and rules of relation--only when we make an impermeable distinction between subject and object. In a textual condition, while such a distinction can be drawn, it can only be maintained arbitrarily. Even structural linguistics is riven by difference, and its best practitioners, conscious of those differentials, have always tried to make them as explicit as possible. What has this to do with the possibility of using digital technology to improve the study of traditional text? The discussion may perhaps appear simply to have spun to a dismal conclusion about that possibility. But my argument is that we (necessarily) reach dismaying conclusions in these matters when we discount or miss the character of traditional text. Text generates text, it is a code of signals elaborating itself within decisive frames of reference. A text is a display and a record of itself, a fulfillment of its own instructions. Every subsequent re-presentation in whatever form--editorial or interpretive-ramifies the output of the instructional inheritance. are Jjke mcta) derivations. From an analytic perspective, what is especially interesting about those re-presentations is their unmistakable errancy with respect to the "original text." Whereas the latter appears self-identical, the former seem alien interventions brought-paradoxically if not ludicrously-to reveal the truth

152

Radiant Textuality

about an original object that-paradoxically if not mystically-seems difficult to access despite its clear integritas. But because text is a field of dynamically unfolding elements and relations, every "state" of a text represents an arbitrary form "taken out of The Form," as Spencer Brown might put the matter (see chapter 7). These forms are de-forms and their usefulness for text analysis lies exactly in the set of differential possibilities they call to attention. Every text is a network of roads taken and not taken. Some of the roads have never been taken, so far as we know, and of the roads known to have been taken, some are well traveled and some hardly traveled at all. Who traveled which roads, and when, and where, are matters of consequence to anyone studying the texts. Roads identical in one respect or another may be seen as very different roads if viewed from a different vantage-and of those different points of view, many will be possible. -"But those are mere figures of speech," you will say, "how do you translate them into digital instructions?" -"Look for the protocols of figuration. Here the graphic text may serve as an instructive figure-a clear instance-of an elementary set of instructional options (not 'figures of speech' but typographical figures-so to speak). The instructions are always instructions to mark and hence to deform/transform. So take any given poem and make a schedule of its transformations. Readers do this as a matter of course as they move through a text and make themselves the measure of a process of transformation. Scholars searching the text develop those transformations to exponential degrees. Let the transformations be marked and let their forms be stored in a network of related forms. Let that network of forms search itself and generate further forms out of itself, and let the process replicate. Ask the network to display the forms realized or not realized in any given text or set of texts." We don't want to discover what the texts mean but what they might be imagined to mean or to have meant. Those meanings are a function of what texts might or might not do, given their rules of engagement; and those rules are determined from what they have and have not done, as well as what they might have done or might be made to do given their historical descent. The initial search should, I believe, be undertaken at the elemental level of figuration-that is to say, in the metaphoric field where (so to speak) graphemes are carried across to phonemes and vice versa. The phoneme is a metaphor for language expending itself without record or trace other than the evidence implicit in what Shakespeare called lust in action. Blake saw

RethitJkitJg Textuality

153

this as the language of eternity when he wrote, in The [First] Book ojUrizetJ, that before there was any "Earth ... or Globes of Attraction," "Eternal Life sprung" (plate 3). By contrast or differential, the grapheme is, as Derrida showed, the trace, or a metaphor for language not as an "expense of spirit" but as a reflexive record of itself. Both grapheme and phoneme are forms of thought and not facts-not character data but parsed character data, or "data" that already functions within an instructional field. The elemental scene where those metaphoric transformations expose themselves is the marked field, the graphical or auditional record. Because this will be a record of rule-governed differences, one can extract from that field a dataset of (hypothetical and arbitrary) rules that could replicate analogous differences in comparable fields (including the original record as it might be augmented and transformed by replicant operations). The output of such operations would be collated as a calculus of variants and delivered to us for study. Throughout, the operation assumes that the representation of knowledge involves the construction and display of difference. That assumption appears in every final "output" as a confrontation between a digital display of knowledge and a human reflection of/on the display.
Instructional Examples from The Garden of Forking Paths

A. Byroll's "To the Po" / "StatJzas to the Po"
There are two holograph manuscripts, a draft (MS. M, 1819, Morgan Library) and a fair copy (MS. B, 1820, New York Public Library). Both are titled "To the Po. June 1819,"10 both are in continuous units rhyming like abab quatrains. Because no space breaks come between those rhyming units, the rhyme scheme could as well be described ababcdcdefef ... 11 Several copies were made from manuscript M during Byron's lifetime by other persons, all arranging the poem in distinctly spaced quatrain units; all are titled, however, as the holograph manuscripts. The poem was first printed after Byron's death (1824) without a title from one of those dependent nonholograph copies, and it was first printed in an authoritative collected edition in 1831 from a modified version of the 1824 text. The 1831 text is in quatrains and is titled "Stanzas to the Po." All subsequent editions follow the 1831 version until 1986, when the text was printed as it was left by Byron 12-that is to say, tJot in space-marked stanza units but as a continuously unfolding text built from quatrainlike units that are sometimes end-stopped and sometimes enjambed.

154

These two basic textual forms represent different sets of reading instructions for the work. Choosing one or the other radically affects both how one physically negotiates the work and how one interprets it for meaning. Furthermore, the existence of both of these forms points toward a general set of rule-governed options available for textspace scripts. 13 Let us look at the opening 20 lines of the poem in diplomatic transcriptions of Byron's manuscript text, on one hand, and the influential 1831 printing, on the other. First, then, the manuscript text of 1819:
To the Po. June 2nd 1819. River! That roUest by the ancient walls Where dwells the lady of love, when she Walks by thy brink, and there perchance recalls A faint and fleeting memory of me, What if thy deep and ample stream should be A mirror of my heart, where she may read The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee Wild as thy wave and headlong as thy speed? What do I say? "a mirror of my heart"? Are not thy waters sweeping, dark, and strong, Such as my feelings were and are, thou art, And such as thou art were my passions long. Time may have somewhat tamed them, not forever Thou overflow'st thy banks, and not for aye The bosom overboils, congenial River! Thy floods subside, and mine have sunk away, But left long wrecks behind us, yet again Borne our old career unchanged we move, Thou tendest wildly to the wilder main And I to loving one I should not love

The linguistic changes that come into the 1831 text shall not detain us, interesting as they are. We shall concentrate on bibliographical details only, and especially on the general graphical transformation of the shape of the poem as Byron originally wrote it. Crucial to note is that Byron wrote the poem in metrical quatrains rhyming abab. By long-standing typographical convention such a verse form is normally arranged as in the 1831 printing, that is, in separate fourline stanzas. But when he wrote the poem Byron departed from that convention, nor is it difficult to see why: Running the quatrains without stanza breaks forces an approach to the affective pace of the poem that turns the graphic form into a figure of the dominant linguistic figure (headlong passion and headlong river). The eye registers the presence of the quatrains and the refusal of the stanza convention and then "reads" the relation between the two. Much can and should be said about the implications of what we see here. At the most general level we remark the signifying character of even the most elementary typographical conventions of verse presentation. What we observe here of this four line stanzaic form should be extrapo-

156

Radiant Textuality

lated to the presentational character of all stanzaic forms, as well as to the visual segmentations executed at the text's lower-if no less significantlevels. Punctuation is the most crucial visible form in this case. We want to recall that this highJy evolved set of marks represent signs that were originally introduced as notations both for oral articulation and syntactic differentiation, and that they function in both registers to this day. As a set of oral cues-whether in silent or in articulated reading--punctuation is a foundational element in the affective (as opposed to the conceptual) ordering of the poem. As a set of syntactic cues it is also a signifying system foregrounding dominant sets of conceptual relations in the text. We see some striking illustrations of these matters in this Byron poem. Compare, for example, the terminal punctuation of lines 4,8, and 13 in the two versions. In line 8, what a difference between the exclamation point and the question mark. Or consider lines 4 and 13. In the 1831 text the editors introduce an end-stopped punctuation that isn't present in Byron's manuscript, and they further alter the movement of the text by breaking Byron's word "forever" into two words. The two texts signal very different pacings-what Keats famously called "unheard melodies"-for the reader. Furthermore, the t 83 t punctuation of line t 3 also directs the reader to a different conceptual understanding of the poem. In Byron's manuscript the enjambment at the end of line t 3 places the phrase "not forever" in a zeugmatic structure such that we are asked to read it simultaneously in two different syntaxes (as modifying "tamed" and as modifying "overflow'st"). The 1831 punctuation is a visible signal to read the phrase in only one syntax. In this respect it replicates the meaning signaled in the t 831 decision to print the poem in four-line stanzas: to do that is not only to tell the reader that the poem's basic metrical unit is a quatrain, it is also to say that the quatrain and its textual presentation stand to each other in a relation of symmetry rather than a relation of tension. And that "statement" imbedded in the text's visible form plainly goes to the very core of this poem's intellectual and affective meaning. We want to point out that in this example we have consciously chosen a poet who is not known for any special interest in exploiting graphical forms for poetical effect. We leave aside Blake, Rossetti, Dickinson, and pattern and concrete poetry precisely because we wish to show that the standard presentational and graphic features of text are signifying features as such. In the effort to articulate meaning, affective as well as conceptual, one necessarily installs the visible resources of language. For every text is comprised simultaneously of a beauty of inflections as well as a beauty of innuendoes.

Rethinking Textuality

157

Here are two further examples. I shall not elaborate explanations in these two cases but leave those exercises in particularities to the reader.

B. Byron's "Men

Two Parted"

In this case we are dealing with equivalent texts that are migrating authoritatively through different textspaces. A simple example of this kind of situation in Byron's works involves the document he published separately in 1816 under the tide "The [ncantation" and the equivalent text that appeared in 1817 as part of Byron's play Manfred. Text is a spacetime manifold where these kinds of translations and reinvestments take place on a regular basis. "When We Two Parted" is remarkable only because it illustrates how complex these relationships can become. Between 1812 and 1823 some or all of the text published by Byron in 1816 as "When We Two Parted" was incorporated by him in at least eight completely different kinds of textual document-as printed and manuscript documents; as singly authorized and collaborative documents; as integral poetic manuscripts and as parts of manuscript letters where the formal poetic status of equivalent texts are completely transformed by incorporation in new prose expositions; and finally, as integral poetic forms that exhibit completely different metrical organizations.
C. Byron's "Fare Thee

This is another case of migrating texts. [n this case the textspaces differ because only some of the translations and reinvestments are deliberately authorized by Byron. The most common instance of this situation unfolds as the general transmission history of any particular work or author during and then after his or her lifetime. Because that history commonly appears to us as more or less integrated and continuous, eventuating at any point in a largely transparent and apparendy self-identical text, "Fare Thee Well!" is a useful case. Although the lexical form of the poem differs hardly at all moment by moment across its process of transmission, this work is marked by many contradictions. tensions. and discontinuities generated through the bibliographical coding. Those contradictions are most apparent in the sequence of the poem's transmissions in 1816. Byron distributed copies in manuscript to various persons. and he had the poem printed twice. In the interstices of those acts of authorial transmission appear other acts of textual transmission-in manuscript as well as print--executed by other par-

158

Radiant Textuality

ties, many of these persons Byron's enemies who clearly "read" his poem in antithetical ways. This network of relations is highly dynamic and interdependent, with different texts emerging as responses or consequences of other texts. In all cases, while the linguistic level of the texts remains fairly stable, the material/transmissional forms stand as eloquent witnesses of radical changes in the poem's "meanings."
Knowing Games

What then does distinguish cybertext from traditional docutext? Without pretending to answer that question, I would call attention to the special kinds of simulation that can be realized in cybernetic environments. While both Aarseth and Murray discuss computerized simulations, their critical taxonomies permit the subject to come forward only at the interspaces of their studies. Of course all traditional texts construct simulations, but with docutexts we engage these simulations as "readers." A project like Michael Joyce's celebrated hyperfiction Afternoon or my own Rossetti Archive are paradigms of the "humanities" cybertexts we see all around us now. Both were conceived and designed as high-order reading environments. The Rossetti Archive was imagined as a simulated syndesis of a critical edition of Rossetti's textual works with a complete collection of facsimile editions of those works and a complete set of illustrated catalogues of all his pictorial works, including the reproductions of those works. The whole, however, remains a study environment embedded in a reading environment. In this context it helps to remember that Plato disapproved of these kinds of textual simulations as instruments of study, thought, and reflection. For Plato, the optimal scene for thinking had to be living and dialectical. Texts are inadequate because they do not converse: When we interrogate them, Plato observed, they maintain a majestic silence. But in MUDS (Multi User Domains) and with various kinds of cybergames like ELIZA, one enters simulated environments where the user's interaction is no longer a readerly one. This result comes from the construction of a textual scene that simulates in real time an n-dimensional spatial field. One thinks of the Chorus's speech to the audience at the opening of Hetlry V, except in cyberspace the "wooden A" of the Shakespearean stage has been extended to include the audience as characters in the action. 14 Computer games exploit this new dynamic space of textuality by inviting the user to play a role in the gamespace. These are well-known role

Rethinking Textuality

t 59

types like warrior, hero, explorer-adventurer, creator-nurturer, problemsolver, and so forth. And while players may well have to read at various points, their participation in the game is not readerly. When cybertext enthusiasts speak of the "passive" docutext and the "active-participatory" cybertext, they are calling attention to this differential. Traditional readers rightly point out that reading is a highly participatory activity and one that is commonly quite as "nonlinear" as any cybertext. When the examples from Byron show us that multiple coding operates at the elementary material level of textspace, they are simultaneously demonstrating the interactive nature of that traditional textual condition. As a traditional literary text enters (or is translated into) a cyberspace, then, it will be laid open to "participations" that mayor may not be readerly participations. Indeed, paperspace is a far more effective medium for reading than cyberspace. From the point of view of someone wanting to create imaginative works, however-narrative or otherwise-cyberspace is replete with inviting opportunities. But from the point of view of the scholar, or someone wanting to reflect upon and study our imaginative inheritance, the resources of cybernetic simulation remain underutilized. The difficulty is conceptual not technical. Even when we work with cybernetic tools, our criticism and scholarship have not escaped the critical models brought to fruition in the nineteenth century: empirical and statistical analysis, on one hand, and hermeneutical reading o'n the other. What critical equivalents might ' we develop for MUDS, LARPS, and other computer-driven simulation programs? How would one playa game oLcritical analysis and reflection? That quesDon brought imu view the idea for what we would eventually call "The Ivanhoe Game." It would be a multi-user game designed to expose the structures of imaginative works like Scott's famous romancewhich is also to say the structures that any literary work like Ivanhoe makes possible through the double helix of its genetic (social) codes: its production history and its reception history. These are the content fields of the game of Ivanhoe--discourse fields, as their scholars call them. The game would be played in either of two available multi-user domains: a real-time environment and a list-serve environment. Players would enter one or both as they like, and they would engage with others either as themselves or under consciously adopted roles. The game is to rethink Ivanhoe by rewriting any part(s) of its codes. Two procedural rules pertain: First, all recastings of the codes must be done in an open-text environment such that those recastings can be themselves

160

Radiant Textuality

immediately rewritten or modified (or unwritten) by others; second, codes can only be recast by identifiable game-players, digital or human, who have specifically assumed a role in the game. Any number of roles might be played. There are the roles of the fictional characters first imagined by Scott for his romance and for its surrounding materials. But to these we add other possible roles: persons involved in the book's material production; Scott's precursors, contemporaries, and inheritors Oiterary and otherwise); early reviewers and any of its later readers, reviewers, critics, illustrators, redactors, translators, or scholarly commentators; in general, persons in the book or persons who might have been in it, real or imaginary, as well as persons who read the book or who might be imagined reading it, for whatever reason. The roles may be played in various forms: in conversation or dialogue, through critical commentary and appreciation, by rewriting any received text, primary or secondary, seen to pertain to Scott's work. The goal is to rethink the work's textuality by consciously simulating its social reconstruction.
VOICE OF AN ANGEL. But this is implicitly to propose that the works of our cultural inheritance have no meaning or identity an sicll-that their meanings are whatever we choose to make of them. It is to make a mere game of the acts of imagination. VOICE OF THE DEVIL. Are we then to make a business or religion of those acts? If we see it as a business then we propose to make something of our inheritance and not simply bury it in the ground, lest it be lost. If it is a religion we propose to recreate the world anew exactly as did the demiurge of the Book of Genesis when he refashioned his pagan inheritance by pretending there were no strange gods before him and then making a rule forbidding any later ones as well.

The electric things have their lives, too. Paltry as those lives are. -Philip K. Dick, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
rying to think about texts, documents, and their possible electronic transformations, I am going to begin at a severely oblique angle. I do this to set a visibly disorienting figure-obliquity-into the rhetorical structure of the exposition. We all know too much about texts and textuaIity. We need to think about them in different ways. Knowing this move is being made, you may, I trust, willingly suspend your belief in it and instead work through its evident premeditation. My hope is that the exposed rhetorical illusion will set a clarifying frame around the issues, the way Brecht sets a clarifying frame around his theatrical investigations by exposing his use of them. The discussion will begin through a return to G. Spencer Brown's remarkable 1969 book LAws of Form. t In his Introduction Brown notes that in writing his book "I found it easier to acquire an access to the laws [deliberated through the work) than to determine a satisfactory way of communicating them" (xxii). The comment seems at once, and paradoxically, both modest and outrageous, particularly for a book that takes as its point of departure and central subject "self-referential paradoxes." That modest/ outrageous statement is as much a self-referential paradox as the famous one Brown cites in the preface to the American edition of his book: "This statement is false." Brown's observation about his expressive difficulty cuts to the center of the laws of form his book seeks to elucidate, as I hope to demonstrate later in this chapter. Laws of form, it turns out, are expressive (trans)forms and

T

194

Radiant Textllality

are reflected-and reflexive-as such. And certain kinds of text-Brown calls these "injunctive" texts-reveal why it's difficult to communicate the laws they themselves realize. This chapter will thus reconsider the issues taken up in LAws of Form. My purposes are, however, more narrow and more practical. I want to elucidate some key but neglected formalities of textual documents and to meditate satisfactory ways of communicating those formalities. I am particularly interested in documents that have been indispensable for traditional humanities disciplines: language and literature, history, philosophy, art. 2 Realizing the need to develop a reliable system for representing such documents in a form that lays them open to the power of digital analysis, humanities computing during the past 20 years has worked hard to develop a model for text markup with general applicability. Despite the problems its own implementation exposed, the model of TEl was developed and, as we've seen, has become a disciplinary standard. 3 But with increasing numbers of humanities scholars using digital tools in their research work, the realization is growing that TEl's problems are not technical but systemic. To address them properly we have to step back and think not about TEl but about "text" itself. 4 What is text? I am not so naive as to imagine that question could ever be finally settled. Asking such a question is like asking "How long is the coast of England?" But now we have to ask it again because when the question was re-posed by our digital culture, the humanities response proved inadequate: on one hand a reactionary refusal to admit that this new culture had any right to ask such a question (Sven Birkerts); on the other, the emergence of TEl and the proposal that its view of text would serve the interests of humanities scholars for digital culture. Much is at stake here. Even now we are beginning the process of re-editing--of representing-in digital form the entirety of our received textual and documentary \ archive. How successful this effort will be depends on how clearly we understand the materials we have to work with. On one hand, digital tools often appear strange and wondrous, especially because they spawn and mutate so quickly into rich and surprising possibilities. Books and documents, on the other hand, seem stable and familiar. They are tools we have learned how to use, they are reliable. The question is, how well do we understand them? Too well, I believe. They have become familiar to us and consequently have grown much more obscure. Brown's unusual approach to questions of form can help us think our way back into the problems of textual forms. But his work will itself benefit by a tangential move. To begin thinking

Dialogue and Interpretation at tile Interface of Man and Machine

195

about textuality with Brown, then, lees begin again further back, by thinking about textuality with Dante, whose grasp of the subject was acute. His way of thinking is especially useful in this case exacdy because it is a premodern way. Inner Infinities In the Vita Nuova, Dante regularly attaches explanatory prose descriptions to the poems he imbeds in his famous autobiography.5 These "divisions," as he calls them, are "made to open the meaning of the thing divided." Some of the divisions are so brief as to seem perfunctory. Others appear so simple and transparent that we wonder what use they might serve. Then again, in the case of one sonnet-an especially cryptic one as Dante himself acknowledges-no division is supplied because, Dante says, "a division is only made to open the meaning of the thing divided; and this, as it is sufficiendy manifest through the reasons given has no need of division." The "reasons given" are the words in the text that explain "the occasion of this sonnet."6 I shall have to pass without remark much in these "divisions" that could be usefully taken up, even in the present context. My focus will be on a pair of related matters: the fact that dividing the poems into parts should seem to Dante a way of opening up their meaning; and the fact that the divisions Dante makes seem arbitrary. For example, after quoting the sonnet "Tutti li miei penser parlan d' Amore" Dante says that "This sonnet may be divided into four parts" ["Questo sonetto in quattro parte si puo dividere "1 and he then proceeds to do two things: First, he restates in schematic terms the prose sense of each of the designated parts; second, he then indicates where in the poem each part falls. Although the exegesis may in any particular case be more or less elaborate, this is the general double form that it always takes. Note that in dividing this sonnet Dante chooses to distinguish four parts-that is to say, his partitioning represents a judgment Dante makes about what would be useful for the reader to know. The arbitrariness of his divisions leap to one's mind as soon as we see where the four parts separate from each other. In the case of this sonnet, part 1 comprises only line 1, part 2 includes lines 2--6, part 3,lines 7-8, and the last part covers the sestet. Looking at his divisions for the other poems in the text, we find that they too have little relation to their highly formalized metrical structures. The divisions cut across those structures 10 apparently random ways, as we

196

see in the case of this sonnet. The randomness is all the more clear because Dante does not disguise from us the fact that the divisions have as muchperhaps more-to do with his purposes toward his readers as they do with the formal structure of the poems themselves. We notice as well that the exegeses, even the elaborated ones, are spare to a degree. Unlike for instance in the Convivio, Dante gives no thematic or symbolic interpretations. Indeed, wherever the poems seem most obscure he typically retreats even further from explanations, even from the schematic divisioning process that marks his method here. So in the case of the sonnet that he doesn't divide at all, Dante says something remarkable. Though obscure and ambiguous words spring up, like tares among the wheat, in the passages "whereby is shown the occasion of this sonnet" in a clear way, Dante chooses not to provide a divisioning, for the difficulties, he says, can't be solved by anyone who doesn't have a deep insight into the issues in the first place:" And therefore it were not well for me to expound this difficulty, inasmuch as my speaking would be either fruitless or else superfluous." Dante's method is perhaps most fully revealed in his prose division of the great canzone "Donne ch'avete intelletto d' Amore," the Vita Nuova's central text. "That it may be better understood," Dante says, "I will divide it more subtly than the others." Then, having laid out an intricate set of divisions and subdivisions, he finishes his analysis with a remarkable set of statements:
I say, indeed, that the further to open the meaning of this poem, more minute divisions ought to be used; but nevertheless he who is not of wit enough to understand it by these which have been already made is welcome to leave it alone; for certes, I fear I have communicated its sense to too many by these present divisions ....

From all this several things of importance seem clear. For Dante a process of divisioning could be carried on indefinitely, with a partitioning analysis moving to isolate further ranges of subdivision at any and all levels. Furthermore, if the divisions represent "objective" characteristics of the poetical work, they come to expose only a certain range or set of the poem's formalities-one reconstructed as a certain perspective on the poem taken by Dante. These divisions are, as we've already noticed. incommensurate with any metrical structure; they transcend sentence grammar; and they represent only what Dante himself thinks might or might not be useful for the reader. He seems to produce them as models

Dialogue and ItJterpretation at tire Interface of Man and Machine

197

or stimuli that might provoke readers with "wit enough to understand" and to search out meanings (and divisions) for themselves. Finally, Dante's divisions do little more than mark off places in the poems, as if each were a kind of field or area to be mapped rather than a complex linguistic event to be paraphrased or "interpreted" in the manner of the Convivio or of the "readings" we have cultivated in our twentieth-century exegetical traditions. In setting out these divisions for his poems, Dante recalls us to a crucial primitive level of his work's textuality. The significance of Dante's divisionings can now be exposed further by considering them in relation to Brown's Laws c?f Form. These laws draw out the structural dynamic implicit in form as such. The elemental condition or manifestation of form is the appearance of a mark in an otherwise unmarked space. Brown calls this mark a "distinction" so that the elemental law of form is: a distinction can be drawn. Every conceivable formal world may be traced or tracked back to that elementary law. Dante's textual divisions illustrate his understanding that the same law underwrites the making of poems. Each poem is a kind of world or universe to itself, and any set of poems-for instance, the set chosen for the Vita Nuova-may be conceived and fashioned into a meta-universe. So we might say-might show, as critics have done for centuries-that the Vita Nuova is usefully seen as part of other networks and textual universes. Or we might turn the direction of our tracing in the opposite direction, back into the subuniverses concealed, as it were, within the apparitions of the specific poems placed in Dante's autobiography. The latter is Dante's own procedure when he offers us his divisions and their arbitrariness points to the infinities of order that may be tracked inward of the poem, through the looking glass of its surface(s).

Argument by Bibliographic Code
Drawing on the ancient tradition of the Arts of Memory, Dante's textual divisiones point toward the inherently spatial conception he has of his textual field. The Vita Nuova is a "book of memory" shaped by visible rubrications so as to give a mirror image of the events it aims to recall. Indeed, it is for Dante only one section or division of a larger book clearly visible to his mind's eye as he undertakes its (re)construction: "In that part of the book of my memory before the which little can be read, there is a rubric, saying, Indpit Vita Nova. Under such rubric I find written many things; and among them the words which I purpose to copy into this little book."

198

Radiant Textuality

Time itself for Dante occupies a space of events mapped on a grid of mathematical and astrological relations. Movement, textual as well as human, occurs within a fixed space where the relations of things is unimaginably deep and complex. One divides this space in order to mark a way into those complex relations. Mark, space, direction: If we think of language in linguistic terms, these words as I've been using them appear to us as metaphors, figures of speech. But if we think of language in semiotic terms the same words take on a literality that can be extremely helpful for understanding how language works, and particularly-for my present purposes-how the language of poetic forms works. From that altered scale of attention we may then start to re-imagine, in the graphematic terms realized through digitization, analytic tools for our most complex semiotic devices. It is useful to remember that the text we are transacting here and now on this page is not just a vehicle for communicating certain ideas. It is simultaneously a reflection of and on itself, an analysis of itself-to borrow from Dante, a divisioning of itself. The analysis is executed semiotically, that is, through the deployment of the forms of what might be called, after Robert Horne, its visual language. This language Horne describes as a composition of words and shapes and/or images. Useful as this definition is, it is not strictly accurate, and the loose feature of Horne's view is important since it pervades, as an assumption, nearly all approaches to textuality. 7 The point is important and must be pressed. Horne sees visual language when he sees wordtext combined with shapes or wordtext combined with images or wordtext combined with both together. But graphically transmitted wordtext is always ab initio "visual" since there can be no wordtext without the presence of what Horne calls "shapes." According to Horne, images are optional to graphic text but shape is not. But in fact whether or not shape enters the pagespace as explicitly drawn boxes or arrows or circles or whatever-these are the forms Horne sees-shape is ever present. Graphically transmitted texts, by elementary "laws of form," automatically generate-perhaps "incarnate" would be the better termshape, which emerges along with the primal "mark" that shapes Brown's demonstration. So far as our common (visual) language is concerned, then, the elementary marks are an alphabet of letters, plus an accompanying set of signs-explicit or implicit-for reorganizing the letter marks into different scales and sets of relation. One can distinguish ("si puC> distinguere") the most common elementary textspace as the page itself (in contradistinction,

for instance, to a scroll's textspace or to the nonlinear textspace of, say, a cave wall). This pagespace is elemental because it replicates at a different scalar level the same kind of distinction marked within the page space by the elementary letter and graphic marks. The relation between the elemc.:I!!at¥ §APl:Jk marks and the elemental page space sets the parameters for all types of graphemic directionality. In the spatial conventions of the page regulated at two dimensions, the normative directions are horizontal left to right and vertical top to bottom (along with a normative line of directionality from upper left to lower right). So for the paperspace at two dimensions, a range of complex spatial options can be manipulated at the borders of the page space, between and within the lines of text, and as blocks of space and/or text formed within the main dynamical textspace area arbitrarily established by the margins, header, and footer. Variant forms of sequence and direction are developed through rule-governed deviations from these norms. In bookspace, pagespace variances emerge as a set of higher order conventions of three-dimensional relations: between page rectos and versos; between the single page and the page opening; and between sequences of pages gathered together. As more explicit shapes and/ or images are introduced into the paperspace, that space will be pushed toward a space governed by rules of collage rather than by rules of textuali ty. B A page of i ted text should thus be understood as a certain kind 0 hic interfac The complexity of the interface varies from a minimal use of the bibliographical codes open to a given paperspace-the text you are now reading is a good instance of such simplicity-to highly elaborated interfaces like those determined as poetic texts. Some of the latter exploit the bibliographical resources of paperspace to an extreme degree--Pound's Cantos, for example, or Dickinson's various writingswhile others are satisfied to work within a set of basic and commonly used conventions. Whatever the specific differentials, however, a broad heuristic distinction separates informational from imaginative texts. The former aspire to transparency, the latter to noise, redundancy, repetition. One is vehicular, the other, iconic. Exploiting bibliographical codes does not per se signal that poetic motives are governing a particular text, as the work of Tufte and Horne-as their own books-indicate. Both participate in a long tradition of "knowledge representation" that mixes textual and graphic forms (a tradition importantly advanced in the late work, the existential graphs, of Charles Sanders Peirce). It is crucial to realize that every text may choose, as it were, to engage that self-conscious tradition. We see this in the layout

200

Radiant Textuality

and general book design of Brown's LAws if Fom,. These apparitional featUfes of the work show Brown's effort to meet the problem of effectively communicating himself. In the event, the rhetorical and design move would elucidate the laws of form at a much deeper level. Figures 7.1 and 7.2 reproduce the first edition of chapter 1, "The Form," which begins with a statement of assumptions, an initial presentation of The Form's elemental definition, and a declaration of The Form's two primary axioms, the law of calling and the law of crossing. Brown's root concept of "distinction" is thoroughly replicated in this text's bibliographical codes, in which various key differentials are developed through the manipulation of pagespace, changes of font, and the deployment of one simple, explicit shape (a line).9 The layout constructs a graphic scene composed of related planes, colors, and textures. The simplicity of the elements can easily disguise the sophistication, even the elegance, of the graphical representations that transact every moment of Brown's conceptual exposition. In terms of the latter, this text's bibliographical codes exemplify-instantiate-The Form's elementary definition as well as axiom 1. The law of calling. The text of chapter 1 does not instantiate axiom 2, the law of crossing, nor is that law exemplified at the bibliographical level in Brown's book anywhere in the first 11 chapters. 1o Of course Brown invokes and applies axiom 2 at a conceptual level throughout, but the axiom is never explicitly marked as such. We realize this remarkable fact about the book only in the culminant chapter 12, "Re-entry into the Form," where for the first time axiom 2 is instantiated. It gets marked in the text, however, not at the twodimensional convention of the page but at the three-dimensional convention of the chapter, as the chapter title indicates. At the page level of the chapter, where a series of experiments are conducted, none of the experiments even invoke axiom 2, much less mark it. That structure in Brown's book is extremely significant for understanding how laws of form operate in a textual horizon. The law of crossing governs reflexive functions, and in Brown's book reflexivity does not explicitly begin until the final chapter, whence it continues through the set of chapter notes and appendices that follow. How scrupulous Brown has been in constructing his text along the lines of his laws is underscored by the way those late chapter notes are (not) marked: Brown provides no links to them from within the chapter texts. The chapters draw and then draw out further and further distinctions until, at the conclusion of chapter 11, the process itself reveals "that the account may be continued endlessly" (68). At that point an implicit injunction becomes explicit in and as chap-

THE FORM

We take as given the idea of distinction and the idea of indication, and that we cannot malee an indication without drawing a distinction. We take, therefore, the form of distinction for the form.

De8nition

Distinction is perfect continence.
That is to say, a distinction is drawn by arranging a boundary with separate sides so that a point on one side cannot reach the other side without crossing the boundary. For example, in a plane space a circle draws a distinction. Once a distinction is drawn, the spaces, states, or contents on each side of the boundary, being distinct, can be indicated. There can be no distinction without motive, and there can be no motive unless contents are seen to differ in value.

H a content is of value, a name can be taken to indicate this value.
Thus the calling of the name can be identified with the value of the content.

Axiom 1. The law of calling The value of a call made again is the value of the call.
That is to say, if a name is called and then is called again, the value indicated by the two calls taken together is the value indicated by one of them. That is to say, for any name, to recall is to call.

G. Spencer Brown, LAws of Form (1969, first edition), page 1.

THe FORM

Equally. if the content -is of value. a motive or an intention or instruction to cross the boundary into the content can be taken to indicate this value. Thus. also, the crossing of the boundary can be identified with the value of the content.

Axiom 2. The law or crossing
The value of a crossing made again ;s not the value of the crossing.
That is to say, if it is intended to cross a boundary and then intentions taken together is the value indicated by none of them. That is to say, for any boundary, to recross is not to cross.

it is intended to cross it again, the value indicated by the two

ter 12, where we are called to reflection, that is to say, where we are called to cross back to chapter 1: "we return for a last look at the agreement with which the account was opened." In point of textual fact, it is the book's first last look back. In the reflexive note to chapter 2 of his book Brown explains that "the primary form of mathematical communication is not description, but injunction. In this respect it is comparable to practical art forms like cookery [and] music" (77). Although Brown does not include text production among these practical art forms, he might and indeed should have done so, as his own book admirably demonstrates. Clearly Dante regards writing, including poetical writing, as injunctive. Dante's word would not be injunction, however, it would be-it was-rhetoric. 11 As Brown's book shows, a primary textual injunction is to make and elaborate distinctions. If these distinctions are rigorously pursued they produce the realization "that the world we know is constructed in order (and thus in such a way as to be able) to see itself": "and so on, and so on you will eventually construct the universe, in every detail and potentiality, as you know it now; but then, again, what you construct will not be all, for by the time you have reached what now is, the universe will have expanded into a new order to contain what will then be" (106). In a splendid act of wit Brown encodes this passage in the typographical convention of indented block quotation. But the passage is not a quotation in the ordinary sense; it is all Brown's own words. Setting it off as he does, however, Brown not only marks the text reflexively, he names himself one of those godlike "universal representatives [who] can record universal law far enough to say" what the passage says. These are altogether (and literally) lowercase gods, as Brown's text shows at a textual level that supervenes the typographical font. After rising to quote Brown's "universal" self in the block quotation, the text descends to its common margins to gloss that universal law as follows: "In this sense, in respect of its own information, the universe must expand to escape the telescopes through which we, who are it, are trying to capture it, which is us. The snake eats itself, the dog chases its tail" (106).
Injunctive Forms

That Laws of Form should display this kind of wit is perhaps not surprising. G. Spencer Brown-mathematician and philosopher-is after all also an imaginative writer-the latter under the pseudonym James Keys, whose strange autobiographical text Only Two Can Play this Game was conceived

204

in the wonderlands of Borges, Abbott, and Carroll. Laws of Form does not resort to an imaginative genre. Nonetheless, an SGML or TEl markup that would adequately open such a work to digital analysis seems as unimaginable as it would be for the Alice books. The conceptual structure-the demonstration-of Laws of Form explains, demonstrates, why this dysfunction must occur in any case where laws of form operate-for instance, in language or any of its instances. Unbeknownst to itself until the moment when it turns reflexively back upon itself-and then it is too late-every form of thought is incommensurate with itsel£ Certain texts-and certain kinds of text-make that contradiction a primary focus of attention. Not many works of philosophy demonstrate that paradox as elegandy as Laws of Form-perhaps Nagarjuna's treatise on "Emptiness" makes an apt comparison. 12 Some do it with greater force-Montaigne, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein (especially in that relendess work known to us as Philosophical Investigations). How to "edit" such writers presents a constant challenge and adventure, and hence a recurrent opportunity to address anew the unanswerable questions they raise. Works of imagination, hpwever-Iet us say henceforth "poetrytt-make the discourse of paradox.,Jnd contradiction the ground of their semiosis. In terms of Brown's Laws of Form, this means that distinctions in poetic texts are elaborated in a space that (so to speak) has no intention of maintaining original integrity. As textual boundaries are defined and crossed, the marks of distinction constituting the boundaries are canceled or threatened with erasure, because new marks of distinction turn out to be phenomenal illusions, closely akin to mathematical transformations. New distinctions conceal algorithms-hidden injunctions-to cancel the same distinctions by recrossing the boundary initiated when the distinction first appeared to view. Whereas everyone knows this about poetical texts, we are less clear about how and why this network of recursions unfolds. Yet clarity on the matter is particularly important in a digital horizon if we are to have any hope of building adequate electronic re-presentations of our received textual archive. Modern linguistic analysis from Saussure to Hjelmslev to Segre develops a four-part analysis of the sign.13 The signifier and the signified-the elemental dismanding and reconstruction of the ancient distinction of form from content-are each shown to replicate in themselves the form/content distinction because in any case both signifier and signified, in order to be recognized as such, have to be separately marked. The marking transaction creates, by the law of form, a new distinction--signifier

Dialogue and Interpretation at the Intetjace

205

versus signified-that dissolves a mistaken implication drawn from the earlier distinction of form/content. In the reconstructed sign both signifier and signified are not only "content constitutive tU they are so precisely because of their "form function tUbecause they have been marked. What this otherwise useful analysis does not indicate-what it positively obscureSt in fact-is the injunctive or rhetorical character of textuality. The structure of any text overgoes its own internal (signifier/signified) coherencies and/or contradictions. In Jakobsonian terms, this overplus is comprehended under the concept of "reference:' The concept functions reasonably well in analyses focused on informational and nonpoetic texts t but its analytic force dissipates when directed toward poetry. This happens because a modern aesthetic understanding shapes our thought about "the literary text.u Since poetical works are conceived as "communication sui generis u (or "language [oriented] toward the message in itself" [Segre t 28-29])t neither affirming nor denying anything beyond their internal relations, "reference u in the literary text turns (virtually) virtual. They are t as manasts used to say, "not among the ideologies.u Texts seen in this light turn dark and passive. They seem not to address us but rather to lie down and await examination t like corpses under autopsy or treasured secrets. That textual structure was fashioned in the rhetoric of romanticism t where a textuality was sought that would not appear to have "a palpable design upon" the reader. But all texts are generated through algorithms; romantic texts are coded with special instructions to obscure the design codes, or rather to make those codes appear not as reading instructions-not as marked text-but as pure character data. The signifier/signified/referent structure implicidy poses two (related) questions to a text: "What is it saying?U and "What is it doing in saying what it sayst' This second question points toward the injunctive feature that is open in every text and in every part of every text. Ultimately one would want to be able to describe and analyze what literary texts are doing, sui generis, in saying what they say-how they function in society and culture at large as they are literary works. To construct that kind of comprehensive analysis t however, we will have to undertake a thorough re-examination of their rhetorical and injunctive character at micro levels. The history of any text's emergence is both a record and an index of how it has been used t what it "meant." Those records should be recovered for a programmatic analysis of their injunctive features, which is to say for their Dantean "divisiones u and their Brownian "laws of form.U

206

Radiant Textuality

(In)Conciusion
But the historical record can only be "recoveredu through acts that cover it yet again, by agencies of markup. Every text descending to us is not only marked text, it is multiply and ambiguously marked. The analytic usefulness of aesthetic texts lies exactly in their generic inertia to pursue and exploit multiple and overlapping formalities and divisions in explicit ways. In such circumstances what is needed is a dynamic engagement with text and not a program aimed at discovering the objectively constitutive features of what a text "is." That dynamic requirement follows from the laws of form themselves, as Brown's work shows. But what equally follows is that the analysis must be applied to the text as it is perfimnative. We begin with an understanding that text is always the marked or materially distinguished text-the text as image and/or audition-and that the textual analysis is itself part of the marking processes that governs the object of study. The problem at this point becomes at once more clear and more difficult to address. One is perhaps reminded of Brown's observation that "I found it easier to acquire an access to the laws [deliberated through the work] than to determine a satisfactory way of communicating them." This difficulty arises because the act of communication promotes and reenergizes the original (historical) ambiguity of the textual signifiers. They are arbitrary forms, open to an indefinite range of significations. The more complex the form of the signifier the more deeply run the ambiguous options of meaning. In the visible state of language they scale up from letters and diacriticals to wondrous scriptural and bibliographical creatures. In this situation the limitations of determinately marked forms can be exploited for more dynamic operations. The proposal I imagine here is directed at visible text only and involves approaching the text not in terms of its semantic "content" but as a physically shaped construction. We do this on the assumption that the physical arrangement of the text amounts to a reflection or interpretation--a marking--of its semantic meaning. The reflection will inevitably introduce a "deformance" of the work, and thus will appear in one or another perspective as what Joyce once called (in the opening chapter of Ulysses) "a cracked mirror": because even at the purely bibliographical level the semiosis of any specific set of signifiers will lie open to different possible readings. The text's non-self-identity extends itself through all marked levels precisely because it is the operation of marking that divides the text from itsel£ The project imagined here attends only to the text's bibliographical

codes in order to begin with a relatively simple set of rules for marking or interpreting textuality. We want to teach the computer a set of rules for reading texts. Trying to teach it higher order rules presents enormous difficulties. It seems possible, however, to develop an initial set of rules for bibliographical coding options and forms. Part of the programmatic operation is to implement these rules in order to expose and generate a more complex set of rules extending to higher orders of textual form. The ultimate event in this program will be a dialogue between the computer and the human beings who are teaching it how to read. We want to study the bibliographical formations that appear out of the computerized readings. These readings will, we believe, inevitably constitute a set of (de)formations full of surprises for the rule-givers. What those surprising readings will be cannot be predicted, but that they will come is, We think, as certain as the fact that no text is commensurate with itself. The more sophisticated we are the more we normalize textual incommensurates. We have internalized an immensely complicated, many-leveled set of semiotic rules and signs, and we control the contradictions of actual textual circumstances by various normalizing operations. We can hope to expose these normalizations-which are themselves deformative acts-by opening the conversation here being proposed between analogue and digital readers. We begin by implementing what we think we know about the rules of bibliographical codes. The conversation should force us to see-finally, to imagine--what we don't know that we know about texts and textuality. At that point, perhaps, we may begin setting philology-"the knowledge of what is known," as it used to be called--on a new footing.

book is a considerably expanded version of the Lyell lectures in Bibliogdelivered at the University of Oxford in May 2000. I am, first, grateful Electors to the Lyell Readership for providing me with the stimulus or,~anise the issues addressed in the following pages, and to my audience contributions in discussions before and after the lectures. tackling so broad a subject, it is inevitable that one draws on experiof many years. There is no substitute for handling books, and thus >pn~ci2Ltinlg their physical properties, their differences, their materials, and appearances. The ideas for this book in a sense germinated as a reof working with the late John Oates, who introduced me to some of complexities of the earliest printed books .. But the results of the bib' lio,~raF·hical work of the late H. M. Adaros; in Cambridge (England) and Mortimer in Cambridge (Massachusetts) will be equally apparent to the student of footnotes. It is an especial personal pleasure to acknowledge here the benefits conferred by Katharine F. Pantzer on everyone who deals with early printing in the British Isles, by her inspired reVision of Pollard and Redgrave's Short-title catalogue of books down to 1640. Other ideas were reviewed and tested with the late Don McKenzie and Hugh Amory; it is this book's misfortune that it could not benefit from the discussions that were developing at the time of their untimely deaths. At various points, I have shamelessly sought help, anq never been disappointed - even though many of those who are named here cannot have realised the purposes of my importunities. In alphabetical order, I am therefore glad to thank Judy Amory, Nicolas Barker, Peter Blayney, Karen Bowen, James Carley, Chris Coppens, Ton Croisetvan Uchelen, Martin Davies, John and Clare Drury, Mary Kay Duggan, Conor Fahy, Christine Ferdinand, Roland Folter, Paul Grinke, Craig Hardey, Lotte Hellinga, Jos Hermans, .

Acknowledgements

innumerable booksellers who have tolerated my searches of their shelves, tables and stockrooms. To the libraries where I have worked on this book, I offer my warmest thanks, and in particular to the many fetchers and carriers of books between the stacks and the reading rooms. Most of the groundwork was carried out in Trinity College, Cambridge and in Cambridge University Library. These apart, the Bodleian Library, the British Library, the Fitzwilliam Museum and the St Bride Printing Library have all provided more than ordinary amounts of support, and I am grateful also to the staffs of Emmanuel College, Gonvil!e and Caius College and StJohn's College at Cambridge, the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, the Houghton, Law and Wid~ri~r libraries at Harvard, and the Firestone Library at Princeton. I am indebted to the Lyell Fund for a grant towards the cost of obtaining and reproducing the illustrations. I have been greatly encouraged in this project by the help and example of Paul Needham, who has steered me through many difficulties and has read much of the book in an earlier form. The mistakes are, of course, my own. For daily succour of all kinds, both for the contents of this book and for more ordinary practicalities, I remain, as always, most thankful of ill to my wife Rosamond.

The printed word and the modern bibliographer

In 1968, the late Harry Carter opened his Lyell lectures with words that have . eome to haunt a generation born since and for whom letterpress printing is A defunct technology. 'Type is something you can pick up and hold in your 'As his next sentence went on to reveal, he had in mind bibliographers, especially those bibliographers whose ingenuity led them to forget this \.tn·darner1tal and material fact. To many bibliographers, and thus to historiliterary scholars, type is an abstraction, that leaves its mark on paper that has no other existence. It was perhaps no coincidence among the lte<)ccupati·ons of the late 1960s that D. F. MCKenzie's vigorously corrective on 'Printers of the mind; some notes on bibliographical theories and l~irltirlg-lilol"se practices' was published only a few months after Carter's ICtl"re,s, though it had been first written several year~ previously.' It is appropriate also to recall some of the otherdevelopments in printing the year 1968, a period when phototypesetting and computer appliseemed to offer the brightest future, and were certainly displacing at a speed whose pace was significantly increased by the activities ofthe COJmpug1:aphic Corporation. In that year, the VDU was first applied to cor.reclting phototypesetting, and Her Majesty's Stationery Office was putting finishing touches to computer typesetting for telephone directories. The authC.ritative books to deal with automated composition were begin- · to appear. 2 Not just for bibliographers, the word 'type' which Harry Carter understood in so tactile and corporeal a manner, was rapidly liking on a new two-dimensional meaning. These developments were pursued wiili an extraordinary concentration of effort, in a fiercely competitive environment. Yet photosetting, ilie basis of so much investment by printers at the time, and which seemed to offer the answer to so many needs, proved to be only a partial solution. Computer typesetting has brought a social as well as a technological revolution that for the first time has (for those who wish it) given authors direct control at their desks over the final printed appearance of ilieir books. During the last two decades or so, we have become accustomed to spc~ak:inj~.·. or writing of'printers' not as people, but as machines made of:pla.sti·c, rn'ej and other substances that sit on our desks: machines driven at

remove from ourselves via the computer, keyboard and screen that now form parts of our daily Jives. In similar linguistic fashion, in the eighteenth century the Royal Observatory at Greenwich employed people who were referred to as computers. At the end of the nineteenth century, the people we now know as typists were referred to as typewriters. Such changes of usage come about almost by accident, but they have their roots in a mechanical
assumption: that the printer or typewriter, human or otherwise, is an agent

of reproduction, of reproducing our thoughts, words and images- usually but not always on paper. There is perhaps something a little foolhardy in attempting to tackle so potentially large a subject as what past generations have understood by printing; but I have been moved to do so for several reasons. First, it has become even more difficult today for many people to grasp what Harry Carter, a printer trained in letterpress, understood by instinct: that for almost four centuries the vast majority of books, periodicals, newspapers, advertisements and all kinds of other printed matter were printed by means of machines and equipment, metal and wood, controlled and made to work by hand; and that metal type was'fundamental to most printing for well over five centuries.3 · Second, the technology of which he spoke has now almost entirely disappeared, in a world where even the basic words in the vocabulary, 'type', 'printer', 'print' or 'screen' have quite different meanings today from those they held until the late twentieth century. Third, and a little more subtly, the dichotomy identified by Harry Carter, bet;;;; type and its mark, compositor and bibliographer, has had a deeper effect on our understanding of the history of the printed word and image than even he may have appreciated. Modern bibliography and historical practice have tended constantly to project the values and i'ldgements of the present back to the values and practices ofthe past. Much contemporary bibliographical practice (I plead indulgence for a term that now has to stretch into the last century but one) traces ·its history from a period on the threshpeak of letterpress printing: the application of the Monotype, and other sophisticated equipment to machine composition; the .triumphs of printing machines by Robert Hoe, Robert Miehle thE:·a,p·pUcation ofphotography to printing as a daily routine
-~traltiQn. 4

expectations in authors, manufacturers and readers alike. Inevitably, as past
everyday practice comes to require conscious study, so its own rationale

slips gradually away. The purpose of historical bibliography is to recover and interpret past practice. As happens in many other fields of research, its considerable success in measuring materiality has not always kept pace with discovering not just purpose and meaning, but also the inconsequential and incidental vitality that distinguishes human activity. At a time when we also face changes in what we mean by books, and therefore find ourselves challenged for better definitions, the fullowing chapters are designed to enquire into a few of the assumptions by which we have lived for the past five hundred and more years. They question, from several points of view, what Paul Eggert has referred to as 'the illusion that imaginative activity gives rise in almost every case to a stable textual product', 5 and by considering what is meant by printing they seek to extend this argument into new territories. Soastobringsomeorderintosolargeaquestion,Ihaveselectedanumber of different but related issues. Some ofthese havebeen aired before, in greater detail and often bypeoplewith more knowledge than I can bring here. Others will be less famil~r:\11t by assembling such·a group of questions I hope to show how assumptions about the apparent authority of print, the reality of its creation, and the combination of conservatism with a creative training in readers, may be questioned, in order that we may better understand the expectations that have underlain a principal means of communication. Accordingly, I shall be exploring the relationship between manuscript and print as it emerged in the creation andmanagement.ofknowledge and ideas during roughly the first 3~0 years after the invention in the west of printing movable types; some aspects of the relationship between print and mL!mtsCiipt in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, aperiod in which frequently find less a revolution than an accommodation; the ways in' printing, ars artium conservatrix, was not so much comptomised as IKte:nded and even partly defined by the employment of older techniques their roots in the. manuscript tradition; some - but by no means of the ways in which printing was seen not so much as an end as a ~gi:nniingin the presentation· of texts; some of the ways in which printing, ~rntin!;tY so final and therefore authoritative a statement, was liable to adjiusltm<ent between printer and reader; the ways in which readers are ~rntselvesexpected to take a part in the process of typographical creation; something of the extent to which the lapse of tinie impinges on the ~rF'OS<~s of printing, publication and reading.

angled views, brief and impressionistic though their treatment has to be, we shall discover how the concept, as well as the act, of printing is not necessarily one of fixity, of textual rest or (still less) of stability, but actually implies a process liable and subject to change as a result both of its own mechanisms and of the assumptions and expectations of those who exploit its technological possibilities to greater or lesser extent. While we speak today, using radical and dramatic vocabulary, of a printing revolution, it was apparent from the mid-fifteenth century onwards, and perhaps especially to the .generations born after about 1470, that innovations in printing were gradual: that both in its technical achievements and in its social (including religious and political) consequences it was not invariably appropriate to speak of rapid transformation. Just as the wooden printing press itself was gradually adapted and improved, illustration techniques were applied to books with more or less success (the process was by no means one of uniform advance), typefounding was an evolving technology, whose processes and organisation were adapted to an international market of printers and readers, so, too, the effects of letterpress printing were felt djf(erently by different parts of the community. The Fifth Lateran Council, i~ t%e second decade of the sixteenth century, is riow often remembered for its attempts to control printing. But the choice of words of the decree Super impressione librorum reveals not only an acknowledgement of the power of the press for good (the spread of scholarly study) as well as for ill. It also explicitly, addresses this sense qf progressive technological as well as social change. 'Ars imprimendi libros temporibus potissimum nostris divino favente numine, inventa seu aucta et perpolita.' 'The skill of book-printing has been invented, or rather improved and perfected, with God's assistance, particularly in our time.' 6 Chronologically, most of my discussion will fall before the introduction of machine-printing in the nineteenth century. There is another volume to be written on the industrialised book, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and with one important exception in chapter 8 I shall have relatively little to: ·say 'a,bouL this period. I wish to concentrate very largely on issues of ·~~~;bliity, as they were conceived and as they were in practice, and as the between the mid-fifteenth century and the beginning eteenth/fhis peri<>d lttas become defined mainly by reference to the (ltd. pr<ess, or common press, even though it was, in fact, one replete ~~i~<es <>f t:edori<)logic:al and material kinds in no way reflected

rtN~ociated industries took time to become established as ordinary practice. The iron hand press survived in commercial use until the second half of the twentieth century, in the shape of Albions, Columbians and a host of nther nineteenth-century iron presses, all worked manually and at not vastly greater speed than the old wooden or common press. The focus in this book is deliberately on western Europe, rather than Just on Britain, though - particularly in the seventeenth and eighteenth ecnturies - I shall have more to say on what will for most readers be the more familiar ground of this country. I have chosen to cast so wide a net In order to bring evidence to bear on questions that, whether they were acknowledged or not, were of common import. The obvious disadvantage · of such a dispersed approach is that it risks too much abbreviation. But ~gainst t:hat, and far outweighing it, is the advantage of reminding ourselves the commonwealth of print, whether expr~ssed in terms of authorship, ma1nufacture, distribution or readership. The international nature of the obliges us to take such an approach. Although there were sundry dif[ere:na!S in practice between various parts of Europe in this period, there also much that was held in common. Workmen took their skills from ' !Ount·-v to country (Gepnany to Italy and France in the fifteenth century; and the Rhine vall~ to England in the fifteenth and sixteenth centhe Netherlands to England in the seventeenth century; France to Netherlands in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, for example). Type--fo,unc:linLg and paper-makingwere international businesses. From the 1450s onwards, printed books were international objects of merchandise, and therefore of reading. My examples have intentionally been drawn from a range of differ- / . !l_nt kinds of literature - scientific, historical, geographical, musical and pictorial - as well as what we conventionally call literature itself. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, the bibliographical study of books and other printed docmnents, of texts and ofimages, has to do with the manipulation of alpha-nmneric signs or of pictures as they are applied by compositors, printers, proof-readers and others in a host of different environments. Secondly, those signs will.he used by the same compositors, pressmen and others Involved in the recreation and reproduction of texts: not just for 'literarf texts- poems, plays, novels etc.- but also for whatever other forms of writ· !ng and images require to be set or printed. Thirdly, I believe that by seeking to understand the purposes of illustration, and the artistic and technical conventions, opportunities and restrictions ofillutstr·ativerer·roductic)n,~!l; may also reconcile in a more satisfactory way our und·erstartdiJGg:·of ciifl:ert:~ forms of print.

Print, Manuscript and the Search for Order, 1450-1830

In purposely embracing many forms ofliterature, and seeking a common goal, it will be seen that I part company, in some respects, with those who prefer to restrict themselves to what are generally, and often inhospitably, referred to as literary works. In his essay already referred to, for example, Paul Eggert restricted himselfto 'literary works' remarking that they 'usually consist of multiple, often competing, texts:' even though the same might be said for other forms as well. Jerome ). McGann in his discussion of 'The rationale of hypertext: limited his treatment more precisely still:
The poet's view of text is· necessarilyvery different. To the imagination the materialities of text {oral, written, printed, electronic) are inCarnational not vehicular forms. But for the scientist and scholar, the media of expression are primarily conceptual utilities, means rather than ends; to the degree that an expressive fo_nri hinders the

conceptual goal (whether it be theoretical or practical), to that extent one will seek
to evade or supersede ·it- perhaps even, in critical times, to develop J)ew intellectual devices.9

I find it difficult to divorce discussion of the poet's understanding of the materialities of text from those of <;>ther authors. Indeed there are, and have been, many poets from the Greek Bucolic poets onwards, who have explolt1visual forms as a part of their meanings. 10 Among current critical preoccupitions, one might cite Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman. Yet other authors work likewise, in their division of text into chapters or paragraphs, or in the care they take over their illustrations, or in .the way that they dispose their subject-matter between the larger type of primary parts and the smaller types offootnotes or sidenotes, or in their anxiety at their choices · of publisher or in their opinions as to the pri~s of their books. All these are in some sense 'incarnational' in that they directly affect the birth of the book for the reader,, and hence markets for anticipated sales, and (finally) the reader's response. Moreover, and despite a vocal minority, for whom the .>vi$U!tl iJnpact of poetry is as important as its alphabet-based content, there is ln Ino:st contemporary commercially published poetry to suggest that distinctive 'incarnational' influence over the finer points of llpl~pe:r, format or binding. la;vedcravmJmost<:xaJnp!esfrom aboutthree-and-a-halfcenihes\Of;h'lstc>ricalbibliography have a general bearing on !lfjtea.\iitagth!tt·conlmtantd 1m influence permeating- not !te··\Wbr<illl;of'that subject.

observed in some generations, that we may identity by historical or criteria. But the principles survive these changes; indeed, the means process of their survival help us to establish their nature. In all this, we shall be exploring the interaction between the everyday and compromises of human experience and the possibilities of ~echa11ical rep1codluction.Thereby, we shall be facing some ofthe same issues challenge us with each computer-based reworking of the relationship author, meaning and reading. these contexts, it is also necessary to consider how bibliographical unersltandir·g must be sought not exclusively in the material, social and other :or1onaic conditions of manufacture and commerce- what we may call the >adiitional skills of historical and textual bibliography- but also something it is affected by the course oftime. With some notable exceptions, this dimension, of time, is underestimated or ignored by many who have about the creation of a book in the printing house. D. F. McKenzie Peter Blayney have both demonstrated, the one from surviving docunerltrucy records and the other from a detailed typographical examination ofl,or>ksfor whose timetable of production the evidenCe is otherwise some''Wlhat th·in,ho·w cru<:iall is the relationship ofone task to another, and therefore how much we need to understandtfi&ctelative durations of chronological processes.U McKenzie's work appeared a~ long ago as 1966; yet it is still possible to find uncritical and incautious assumptions about the often messy reality of running a printing house. The printing of a book may take a few weeks, or it may take many years. The first volume of Roger Long's Astronomy, aJ1noml.ced in 1730 and printed privately in Cambridge, was publi~hed in 1742; but the second, in train for much ofthe remainder ofhis life, was not completed until 1785 - fifteen years after his death. 12 This is by no means a phenomenon unfamiliar to the twentieth century. It took twenty years to print Strickland Gibson's edition of the old statutes of the University of Oxford, published in 1931.1' I have, however, a different chronological sequence in mind. Perceptions of books chang't with. time; and with them there change also our ways of using and looking at books. I think not only of bibliophile fashions, on which there is a large if often somewhat uncritical literature. Rather, I wish to draw attention to· how the trade in,. and manufucture of, new books may be influenced by the past; how books may change their, status even before they are sold for the first time (and have not yet survived long enough to be accorded the attentions of collectors, antiquaries and

time.

I am also concerned with some of the ways in which a more comprehensive bibliographical understanding of illustration, its methods and its applications, may enhance our understanding of what we mean by stability. literature on the history of illustration is noticeable for its general failure to engage with bibliographical issues as they affect books; 14 and on the other hand the bibliographical study of books still has to engage with the related but different strategies of pictorial or figurative reproduction. In such matters we may begin to understand better how the printed bookquite apart from the manuscript- may be said to be unstable. Though it is indissolubly bound up with questions of manufacture and . production, I shall have little to say in the following on what we might term the instability of place. The ways in which we read and interpret books depend on the circumstances ofreading (in a library, at a desk, out loud, etc.) as well as where we read, or even where,we obtained what we now hold. We expect a variety of attitudes to the same book in different places, as well as by . different people. In this)cwe face the enigma of how much it can be assumed that the same book will be treated or understood in common. This maverick quality, an essential part ofthe definition ofa printed book, familiar to critical theory in literature and art alike, challenges assumptions that books possess a uniformity not just of content, but even of interpretation. 15
In assessing the changing W'\YS in which authors, printers, publishers and readers have. related one to the other in the course of the period between the mid-fifteenth and the early nineteenth centuries,. it is a help to establish ~orne broad headings for our questions. The period may be broken down ~ummary fashion as follows. (a) Fifteenth to early sixteenth centuries: at printing, and in particular at its speed of production and its !Ji'I).roduce.·mtutiple copies of apparendy the same text; a period of ~]per·im,ent rutdcmnprolni,;e.

between history and method also apparent in illustration. (d) Early nineteenth century: driven by cost (not least the rates of pay for compositors) and by a new awareness in an industrialised world of the relationship between production and increased demand and consumption, a revived interest in Hpeed, in the technical possibilities of new inventions and in their social and Interpretative implications. While, obviously, there are many people, and many other strands in the tale, that do not conform to this pattern, and it neglects some major issues auch as the relationships- modern or historicised- of printing and politics (as diverse as Milton, L'Estrange and Atkyns, to take examples of just one generation in mid-seventeenth century England 16 ), the overall framework does suggest how bibliographical analysis may be made to discern a shift of still more fundamental importance in the histpry of authorship and reading. By approaching the history of the book, and the creation ofliteratnre of all kinds, in this way, and by emphasising the always transient and unstable nature ofits manufacture, we shall better understand that our present awareness of such textual characteristics in a new electronic environment is not a modern one, but one that is inherent in that supposed!)( fixative medium, of print; anq that print itself has been understood to be unstable since the mid-fifteenth century. Hinman's work on f:'G§'talrespeare First Folio, and that ofR. M. Flores on the earliest editions of Don Quixote, taught the world one aspect of what had been known to all printers from the fifteenth to the early nineteenth centuries: that printing-house practice resrt!ted in unpredictable ·and incalcrt!able variation between copies of books bound up from sheets each of whose differences in themselves cort!d be monitored and demonstrated. 17 This has. also been clearly .demonstrated in the work ofJeanlie Veyrin-Fof'rer on the first press in Paris, and of-Lotte Hellinga on the work of Peter Schaeffer at Mainz. 18 Books are printed by men as well as by machines. What ought to be a commonplace had to be forcibly demonstrated by McKenzie in his examination of the daily routines, and exceptions to routines, in the Cambridge printing house at the turn of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 19 How exactly authors' and reader~ understandings and assumptions of such instabiJities have changed over the centuries is another matter, to which_I will,turn in my final chapters. In a paper on the material origins of the.. New Bibliography, josepl:v!.b1i...

had photographed pages from the Codex Alexandrinus in 1856. The application of photography to zincography, and hence to the first conventionally printed photographic facsimiles of printed books and manuscripts (notably of the Domesday Book in 1861-3 and of early editions of Shakespeare) under the aegis of Sir Henry james and others in the early 1860s had an immediate and lasting effect on historical understanding among members of the general public. 21 The work of Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, Edward Bond, Edward Maunde Thompson and Walter de Gray Birch on the Utrecht Psalter in the 1870s, and the founding of the Palaeographical Society in 1873, mark photography's coming of age for shared research in books. 22 In 1892, the very year in which the Bibliographical Society was founded, Konrad Burger began to issue his series of photographs of fifteenth-century printing types. 23 Late-nineteenth-century perceptions, as well as actions, were changed fundamentally by processes of mechanisation, and their implications for all manner of activities, social, domestic or industri;V. Not surpri~ingly, the assumptions of a mechanised world affected the course of bibliographical theory and research. Transforming though they were, McKerrow, Greg and their circle only partially recovered the ,world of the author and printer in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: McKerrow was a publisher by · profession, and Greg's~(arrilly had expected that he would become editor of The Economist, which it ';;~ed. 24 The present book is an attempt to recover a view that is not dependent on the assumptions of a mechanised world, to distinguish between how things are made, and how people think they are ma,de; between what people see, and what they understand. No less pertinently, because of possible ·confusion between ways in 'Yhich bibliqgraphy may accommodate or respond to new technologies, Loewenstein remarks of our own time that 'new information technologies have often prompted a cult of the deconstructed text: and that as a consequence of these same technologies we prop up 'a fetishization of the composite text'. In fact, the composite text has enjoyed an existence that has exploited - openly, or clandestinely, but usually consciously - since liflfteetath century. It has been a bibliographical fact of life, accepted and )wled!led by authors, booksellers, readers and others who would use .ver··sir1ceth~ oeginning of printing with movable type in the west.

circulation of texts of all kinds in seventeenth-century England and, indeed, the new ways in which it was valued and employed. 34 Whether one considers scribal texts or illumination and decoration, the boundary between manuscript and print is as untidy chronologically as it is commercially, materially or socially. In 1645, the brothers Jacques and Pierre Dupuy succeeded Nicolas Rigault as Keepers of the French Royal Library. Rigault had held that position since 1625, a period of twenty years. His long curatorship was not especially notable for accessions in printed books, old or contemporary. Despite repeated legislation, legal deposit seems to have gone largelyunheeded;35 but by !622, helped by Claude Saumaise and Jean-Baptiste Hautio, Rigault had already completed a catalogue of the library, both of manuscripts and of prioted books. Followiog the acquisition of the manuscripts of Philippe_ Hnrault in 1622, a separate catalogue was made for these too. t. ' In so far as there can be said to have been any policy with regard to accessions, the emphasis io this iofluential collection was on manuscripts. Under the regime of the Dupuys, little of this ch~nged. Pierre Dupuy died io 1651, followed by his brother in 1656, so briogiog their rdgo to an end. Despite the great iocrease in the numbers ofbooks published across Europe, and the consequent iotellectual crisis in bibliographical management, accessions of prioted books to the FrenchRqyal Library at this period remained generally poor. Nonetheless, and more importantly for the longer-term organisation "of the library, Rigault's catalogue of 1622 for the first time separat~d out printed books from manuscripts. The catalogue was divided into live sections; three of manuscripts and two of prioted books, each of the groups di~ded again'by language. The Dupuys took up Rigault's work, dividing their own catalogue of the libraryioto just three parts- two for manuscripts and one for printiog. They identified 1,329 printed works, and their work has been regarded as the ancestor of the modern catalogue of prioted books. As a total, and particularly io the context of an iocreasingly active book t.rade~the li):>rary's holdiogs were not impressive. 36 seems probable, !Jutenberg was at work towards, or perhaps even his' first prioting wheri he was recorded at Mainz io 1448, then lV.thalt thLefinaJseparation ofmanuscriptfrom printin the French too>k :ilntost two hundred years following the invention of cilc1\'e:abl.e type in the west.

ltQ!ogtie and on the shelf, in the following edition of the catalogue By 1635, when John Rous's appendix to this catalogue appeared, mingled in the catalogue, but manuscript and print were gradBel>ar,ated on the shelves, a principle encouraged by the arrival of the !l·crints of Sir Thomas Roe (1628), of the Barocci collection (1629) those of Sir Kenelm Digby (1634). 37 At Leiden University Library, i.rn.anusc:rif>ts remained mingled with printed books in 1640, though manuscripts had always been shelved separately, and the divided ofthe rest of the collections was very largely in place by. this date. 38 time of the publication of the next Leiden catalogue, in 1674, the between printed books and manuscripts had been effected. the gradual emergence of the concept of distinction in library orbetween manuscript and print can be mapped in the catalogues of the mid-century. These catalogues, especially (but not only: were many private manuscript copies as well) in their printed form, :rec:orcledlocal holdings for their libraries' readers and bytheirdisp~sal Europe also served a more cosmopolitan purpose in the republic of 39 In the absence of systematic national or subject bibliography, save .very few areas of study, large library catalogues -,public or private valned as guides to knowledge. 40 This was reflected in the.common word 'bibliotheca' to mean libranc.,both in the sense of an actual lle<:uu·H of books and also in a more theoren\::al or (one might say) virsense, of the lineaments and government of knowledge. Hence, library atallogues had an influence as guides both to literature, and also to how .· was to be organised -whether by subject or according to mt;dium. The divon;e of the two media, manuscript and print, was not straightforward, it was accepted With a readilless encouraged perhaps more by the in.ternadonal circulation of many of these printed catalogues than by mutnal consent based on independent assessment. As a class of literature, library catalogues depend heavily on each other for organisation and ideas. This, too, was a stimulus to.a common approach. As so often, ideals , and plans were frequently contaminated in practice. The word 'editns' itself was ambiguous, and was used both of manuscripts and ofprinted books~ in Sanderus's great union catalogue BibliothecaBelgica manuscripta (1641). O~iensiblyofmanuscripts only, in fact Sanderus's work included a r~umber ofprintedbooks, quite explicitly identified in the appropriate place but thus. counteracting his title.41 The continued intermingling. of print and manuscript presented a persistent problem to cataloguers, as may be seen in the catalogue of the library of the politician and diF>lOJlia:t.: Adrian Pauw, published at the Hague in 1654. 42 After the two mediaha·((:bf

carefully divided into their respective sections, there was a brief 'Appendix aliquot librorum, typis excusorum, qui inter manuscripti inventi sunt.' The books included several folios which would have been hard to overlook. Not surprisingly, Amsterdam, centre of the northern European book trade, was sensitive to such issues. In 1612, the brief shelf-list of its town library mingled the two media, and offered only exiguous details of both. In 1622, the successor to this catalogue was slightly more forthcoming, but still interspersed manuscripts with printed books, both in the catalogue and on the shelves.43 The next, in 1668, revealed a reorganised library in which manuscripts, together with a handful of Chinese printed books, were recorded at the end. At Wolfenbiittel, the young Herzog August mingled manuscripts and printed books in the catalogue he began in 1611;44 but his second and much larger catalogue, begun in 1625, provided separately for manuscripts. Intellectual as well as physical differences are reflected in that of the University Library at Groningen, published iu"I669. 45 .It is a rather late example of a unified catalogue, combining print ·and' manuscript in a single sequence. Yet others were later still. The catalogue of the university library at Franeker ( 1713),'6 pitifully lacking in the. most recent books, was prefaced by an earnes(~ppeal to the potential benefactors for whom it wasnot least- intended. ThJfuw manuscripts that the university possessed were mingled with its printed books. For most of Europe, however, and though it has taken centuries to weed printed books from catalogues of manuscripts, and vice-versa, the two media were henceforth to be treated differently.47 In order to avoid any .confusion, Thoiuas Hyde made a point of the <Ji,;tinction when in 1674 he entitled his work Catalogus impressorum librorum Bibliotheca"'Bodleianae, but by then the separation had been already generally accepted. His catalogue, used in annotated and interleaved form as the basis for library catalogues in continental Europe as well as in Britain, set an international agenda.48 By the time that Edward Bernard came to edit the Catalogi librorum manuscriptorum Angliae et Hiberniae (Oxford, 1697), the divorce was largely . effected. In descriptions of afew of the older collections - notably the Laud . a~;~d Junius collections at Oxford- the existing lack of distinction between manuscript and print meant that some printed books were admitted. The accountofHenry Savile's library included many modern printed books (as well as his astronomical instruments); and the much larger library ofBishop. John Moore· featured a long. list .of fifteenth· and early sixteenth-century books, besides those bearing the adversaria of&:aliger, Isaac Casaubon and others. But, as Bernard explainedin·his introduction, such admittances were . rare exceptions.49 A developingliteratgre 9n the history of printing, aJ}d the

turn was regarded as the 'rescuer of Greek and Latin literature'. 57 In other
words, once printed there was no longer an overpowering need to preserve

the manuscript exemplar. Soon after being printed, and to take just two examples, early manuscripts of Pliny and Livy both disappeared from view. 58 The same philosophy of literary inheritance underlay printing that had helped determine the preservation of texts in manuscript, the difference resting in the multiplicity of copies, not in any distinctly new doctrine. The principle of collation of multiple copies was easily carried over into printed editions. When in 1466 the Strasburg printer Johann Mentelin issued a study edition of Augustine, De arte praedicandi, the editor (Stephan Hoes!, a professor of theology at Heidelberg) explained that it was based on manuscripts from Heidelberg, Spejer, Worms and Strasburg.59 Aldus and his advisers w_ere by no means the first to apply editorial principles to the study of multiple witnesses in order to arrive at a supposedly more authoritative text. Nor were they the last to discard books when a new edition had been prepared or obtained: the Bodleian Library's treatment of the Shakespeare First Folio is sufficent reminder of this widely familiar phenomenon.60 The neglect, wilful or accjdental, of many aspects of the past, visible in much of the Reformation, was not incompatible with such an attitude. Selectively dismissive historical and theological reasoning, itself a form of suppression of earlier or other un~oward texts, took dramatic and visible form in the destruction of so many books at the hands of trades in need of skins whether for glue, wrappings or as parts of bindings for new books. Passive neglect as much as active destruction accomplished in a physical way what reasoning, demagoguery and preaching did in peopl~'s minds. Bu! neither the Reformation nor the Counter-Reformation was unique in its attitude to books. The existence ofprinting, and with it the concept of republication and ofnew editions, engendered wholly new ideas ofthe status of the physical form which carried a text. Books could be replaced, and replaced . easily - if not from the copy to hand, then from another elsewhere. This ,,~,~~J!Ct~ptunderpinned the bibliographical principles of selection in Gesner's universalis (1545) and its many followers.H '"''""v"mrk..

There were, of course, exceptions. At Utrecht, substantial the libraries of the Carthusians and the Regular carious were both straight into that of the infant university, opened to the public in For most, the effect was the same: a migration of manuscripts from for whom they had once been of daily use into the hands of those for they had a very different staynsjylsed often on private bibliophily as historical, literary or other criteria, a process often continued when books were entrusted to the new, or newly refotmed, institutions of amalgamating manuscripts of all kinds, old codices and contempopapers, the librarians (and, be it added, booksellers) of the seventeenth ntuLrycmJfirm<:d assumptions that had only ever been partially true: that displaced manuscripts, ·and that the two media were defirlable most "'"'nnr;o1celv· hv their means of production.

and sixteenth centuries. Decisions about what should be kept; different values set on new media compared with the old; differing costs of manufacture; the differing status of texts delivered and shared by the computer rather than by established means; differing abilities to manipulate text; questions of textual unanimity. These and many others present what ought to be perceived as dilemmas worthy of careful and informed analysis, since they incur questions not only of how and what is to be preserved from the past for future study, but also of how the means adoptelf for preservation affect our understanding of the past. In som~ ways they are but a refiguring of questions that should have been addressed more circumspecdy already, in (for example) the changing ways that succeeding generations have understood the concept offacsimile.'0 If (in D. F. McKenzie's words) forms effect meaning, 71 how are meanings to be preserved? 1'h~ngers of embracing first microfilm and more recendy electronic envir6nments as replacements and even at the expense of what we already possess have been demonstrated repeatedly in the assumptions and mistakes of library management. Both these alternative formats offer major and crucial advantages, but only if their limitations as surrogates of originals, and therefore as reinterpretations; new forms for meaning, are understood. Access to facsimiles on the World Wide Web or on locally ileld CD Roms ,is widely offered not as a supplement to library holdings, but as a reasoif not to stock books, and actively to discard in order to save increasingly expensive shelf space. For books, periodicals and other printed matter, photographic or computerised surrogates are being made to serve not merely as an alternative to originals, but as their replacements. This underlying misunderstanding of the nature of surrogates, that they are not equals, but substitutions, has permeated much library management for decades, most influentially in America.

meaning, is more than simply a change in medium~ from paper to screen, from words fixed to a page to words summoned as chemical reincarnations

on film or as electronic pulses in evanescent and re-formed shapes. It also implies many of the same questions that faced the first two centuries ofprinting. The world of IT, computerised editions of books, and scanned images does indeed offer its own separate and beguiling culture. In similar ways, and sometimes using analogous language, the advent of printing was hailed as God-given; the means to multiply and share work on a scale previously unimagined; a technology immensely faster than hitherto; and therefore a means of communication both superior to that which had gone before 'lf!d which was to supersede it. In fact, the new can only be understood by reference to the old, and different cultures and media must inevitably exist side by side. Confusion stalks the beginning of the twenty-first century just as it stalked the fifteenth and siJqeenth. For a while in the 1490s- five hundred years agothe Benedictinr;ri&'nk Johannes Trithemius believed that scribes should not cease their work, since only by writing could works be preserved: For handwriting placed on parchment will be able to endure a thousand years. But how long, forsooth, will printing las/, which is dependent on paper? For if in its paper volume it lasts for two hundred yearS th~t is a long time. 76 In confusing the processes with tlieir materials he revealed more than, on this occasion, a prejudice against printing.

In the last chapter, we noted the poverty of much bibliographical practice as a direct result of misinterpretation: how printing and manuscripts were divorced both in their organisation and in their study; and how as a consequence modern bibliographical (and therefore historical and literary) study has been weakened. We rlotl.'falso that by reconsidering the older relationships between the two media, we might expect to understand better the idea of printing itself. AB a coda, we further noted the importance of thinking about different media not as replacements one for another, but as having joint and interdependent existence: that one does not wholly drive out the other. AB a part of this, we touched briefly on the application of technology to understanding as well as to \lccessing past literature in libraries of our own time. In this and the following chapters, I wish to explore further some aspects of the relationships between print and manuscript in early printed books. For well over two millennia, much of western European civilisation has been surrounded by the public word, mediated in stone, metal or paint on buildings, on memorials, on notices. For a large part of this time the handwritten public notice has also been familiar in some communities. For about one,fif\h 9f this time,· printed words and images have .been an increasing part of everyday lifer~ For more than half a millennium we have assumed famili~~itywith the privately mediated word, in manuscript, print and now in·plkefs.' Y~trthese variously produced words, conveying messages of very different kinds·:and for which the medium carries its own overtones of interpretation·as··well as of importance or circumstance, are of very differing status. Moreover, their relative status may vary from generation to generation. Notices about immediate everyday life become obsolete, but are preserved for their historicalvalue. 2 Printed books fall out of and back into fashion, tall apart, or are replaced by different designs. Even stone inscriptions shift their meaning, as the impetus which caused them to be cut is diluted in succeeding generations. No one who now visi~ the small burial ground in salem, Massachusetts, and sees the inscriptions on the stapes marking the graves of those who died in the seventeenth century, will be grieving at the loss of a

Later on, I shall be much concerned the fluid nature of text, of the ways in which what is, or may appear to fixed may also exist in a multiplicity of shapes: in other words, what is printing itself? The translators of the or King James, vcr:sto11 01 the Bible in 1611 had no doubt (fig. 1).' In a passage that must have seemed anachronistic to those acquainted even remotely with the history of printing, Job 19.23 was translated as follows: Oh that my words were ~ow written! Oh that they were printed in a book! · That they were graven :wjth an iron pen and lead In the rock for everi The contrast of the transient nature of bodily life with the hope of a life to come, enunciated in the next few lines, could not be greater. The next words, one of the central statements in Job, are familiar from Handel's Messiah: 'For I know that my redeemer liveth: with its ensuing allusion to physical destruction, 'iilld though after my skin worms destroy this body; yet in my flesh shall1 see God.'

prosaically written: '0 that they were put in a bok!': and this remained the common intent.

The absence of the reference to printing is prudent,. and obviously more 3:ccur~te in that respect. But we may take this a litde further, and look at the Vulgate.

something printed in the mind; or printed in memory ( obsignatum). These concepts, linked in English but reflected in so disparate a vocabulary in Latin, are all secondary to the first words offered for a Printer as it is used for a manufacturer of books. Viewed in this way, the tantalising choice of words in the 1611 translation may be seen as a forcible and piquant comment on how an educated elite in the early seventeenth century viewed printing itself. Printing is, moreover, to be equated with the most permanent form of record known at that time: engraved letter~ i~ stone. A very similar point was made in the frontispiece to later editions of Sir Edwin Sandys's Europae speculum. Or, a view or survey of the state of religion in the westerne parts of the world, printed for the bookseller Michael Sparke in 1637--8. This woodcut depicts the figures of Time and Death, together holding a book above an hour-glass. The binding of the book in this image, with its metal corner- and centrepieces, and its metal clasps, to the English reader unmistalcably suggests a Bible;, for this was the way in which this book was customarily bound for long and hard use. Around the cut runs the text: Study me in thy Prime/ The Glasse doth Runne and Time doth Goe, I Bury Death and weary Time./ Death hath his EKdibave not so. The enduring nature of the Bibie, the Book, the Word of God, is reason enough forit to be studied. Not much later, Joseph Caryl, whose career as a minister was almost wholly in London and with congregations who were highly literate, was to comment more specifically on Job, in words that accommodated the seventeenth century to ancient times:
We are not to take printing in that strict sense used amongst us, for that new Art or invention opposed to writing . .._. Here printing is taken in a Jarge sense for the setting down and describing of any thing in the most.authentick and strongest manlier, for the perpetuating of it.

The Vulgate, the Geneva version and the translators of the AV Job also all 111entioned writing. This, again, is unjustified by the original Hebrew but is defensible as a paraphrase. More pertinently, it is further notable that there is no suggestion in tile AV that writing may be more or less satisfactory as a r-ecord than printing. The AV preserves tile poetic structure of tile original Hebrew, which is designed not to place one before tile oilier as a sequence (writing preceding printing), but to offer the two as parallels:

In the vast expansion of printed pamphlet literature in the late eighteenth century, and particularly in the nineteenth century, the printing trade met needs by means oflower prices and greater competition, within a context that itself consisted of larger numbers of readers than could be satisfied by writing alone. There is an element here of production encouraging further production, and thus setting its own pace; but by the mid-nineteenth century the strands were clear. Type-setting and the more straightforward printing had become so low-priced, and so competitive, that printing was the cheapest means of producing even quite small numbers of copies. It was to be overcome in turn only by by the advent of the office typewriter and (later) duplicating machine and photocopier. We are a long way from the mixed world of manuscript and print in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but the background issues are not dissimilar. They hinge on questions of taste and precedent, and on questions of
economy.

From the beginning of printing ip western Europe, the two principal media, manuscript and print, have been widely perceived and judged as. true alternatives. There is, naturally, a tendency to emphasise the invention of printing as the precursor of the decline of manuscript: and so it was. Much, too, has been made of the few collectors who continued to pay especial (though by no means necessarily. exclusive) attention to manuscripts for their libraries, men such. as Federic~da Montefeltro (d.l482) in Urbino, Louis de Gruthuyse (d.l492) in Bruges, Ferdinand of Aragon in Naples (d.l494) or Raphael de Marcatellis (d.l508) in Ghent. 18 It is easy to exaggerate their preferences, and the first at least (notwithstanding the celebrated and misleading remark of Vespasiano da Bisticci19 ) was also the owner of printed books. For some, such as Albrecht of Brandenburg, Archbishop of Majnz (d.1545), decorated manuscripts were parts of an art collection as much as of a library. 20 But these collectors, each a veritable Maecenas, were ib.!I!C..,.waytypical of customers in the book trade, whether· before or after invention.

in the 1460s. In Florence and Naples, for example, where local with it local skills continued, the trade in manuscript books, vellum, declined more slowly.22 at the invention of printing was a wonder at its technological In so many respects, it presented an alternative to manuscriptfor some purposes, but not necessarily either better or worse. : we may see this even in the earliest recorded report on work on Bible, the celebra!ed letter written by Enea Silvio Piccolomini to Juan de Carvajal in March 1455.
mirabili apud Francfordiam viso nihil falsi ad me scriptum est. Non integras, sed quinterniones aliquot diversorum librorum, mundissime ~cti:"in1e littere, nulla in parte mendaces, quos ·tua dignatio sine Iabore et legeret. written to me about that marvellous man seen at Frankfurt is entirely not seen complete Bibles, but only a number of quires of variom books Bible].

wonder is partly at the exact evenness of the letters- as letters, not as For hinl, as for many other readers in ilie fifteenth, sixteentll and sevcenturies, the differences between the printed and the manuscript were less inlportant tllan tlleir similarities. sense of innovation, of a wholly new way of reprod!!cing and copybooks, was to become less particularised. 'Qua arte habet haec aetas :rolfeclto inauditum cunctis saeculis celebrandumque miraculum.' 'In this of printing, the present age truly has a miracle worth celebrating, unknown to all previous ages.'25 Just from a technical point of view, Gutenberg's own inventions ushered in a period of what has rightly been called one of intensive experinlentation.26 But such a phrase raises its own questions. First, and like any series ofexperinlents, the develppment of a new idea after the exciten'tent ofits discovery always depends partly on tile application of older, pre-existing ideas and practices as they in turn are tested and adapted anew. Secondly, many aspects of tile late fifteenth-t:entury printed book were subject to changes having notlling in themselves dependent on printing. Questions concerning page layout and rubrication, or tile ways ./ in which long texts were to be described by lists of contents, or the ways in which foliation or pagination were gradually applied to different kinds o'f books, did not of themselves arise from printing rather than manuscript, however much they may have been given new stimulus and focus by !h.eneW technology.

The emphasis usually placed on printing in the west, on its invention in the Rhine valley, and on the subsequent spread of new skills across Europe, has not always been conducive to comprehending the nature of the change in books that occurred in the second half of the fifteenth century. Indeed, what have come to be our assumptions have been largely dictated by those for whom the process of printing was most important. We have come to see through their eyes, rather than those of everyone who was affected by what was, for several generations, only one aspect of the reproduction of texts and images. In generalities if not in particulars, the story of the invention of printing was of early curiosity, and pride. In 1460, the colophon to the Catholicon was clear on the matter:
Alma in urbe maguntina nacionis inclite germanice. Qua~, dei clemencia tam alto ingenij lumine. donoque gratuito. ceteris terrarum nacio.nibus preferre. illustrareque dignatus est Non Calami. stili. aut penne sUffragio. S"ed·-mira patronarum formarumque concordia proporcione et niodulo. impressus atque confectus est.27

I

Peter Schoeffer, also in Mainz, repeatedly drew attention in his colophons to the primacy of his own city as the place of the invention and development .of printing ('impressorie artis inuentrice elimat_riceque prima'). 28 In 1491, Jacob Meydenbach, another printer at Mainz, likewise made much ofthe fact that printing had been invented in his city\'in qua nobilissima ciuitate et ars ac scientia hec subtilissima caract~risandi S".l.l imprimendi fuit primurn inuenta').29 The continuing eagerness of printers in Mainz to laud their own city suggests that there may have been a continuing need. to do so: that the history of the origin of printing was becoming subject to competing claims, one of which was itself put into print in 1499 when the early editions of Donatus's grammar printed in the Low Couotries were introduced into the published tale. 3 Furthermore, this historical selectivity, accurate enough in a general sense,,but not the whole truth in that by the 1490s Gutenberg's invention' ofmovable type had been married to other printing technologies, is a reminder of a phenomenon familiar-to many other historical events and movements: ofhow later generations may come to concentrate on just some aspects of major change. With this principle in mind, it is useful to consider in a little more detail the ways in which some of the earliest printed books were prese!'ted to their readers. The colophon of the Mainz Catholicon (1460) was explicit in its reminder: 'Non calami, stili, aut penne suffragio, sed mira patronarum formarumque.concordia proporcione et modulo, impressus est.' Sch0 effer, too, has left much evidence of his ways of thought. His colopho~s are

as lines to be supplied, or chapter heads) were essential to the use of a book, others (such as marginal decoration) were not. At Strasburg in about 1466, Johann Mente!in drew attention to the treat· ment of marginal index-letters. 'Et quisque cui placuerit poterit eas faciliter
manu sua per pennam etiam in marginibus nigra vel rubio co~ore signare. correspondentem ad istas intra literam positas, quod non parum vtile erit, quia citius in margine posite occurrent querenti., 35 It was up to the reader to

make the book more efficient. In other words, this process was by no means expected only to be executed by members of the book trade. For example, a copy ofJohannes Nider's Sermones de tempore et de sanctis (Speier, 1479), was bought by a priest named Martin Hehn in Upper Austria in 1483, and in 1484 he recorded at the end of the volume that he completed its rubrication himsel£ 36 All the emphasis, by printers at the time and by others since, tends to be on the achievement of printing- the innovation that transformed not only the production ofbooks, but also the ways in which they conld be employed. But in order to understand the. nature of this revolution, it is helpful to ask the opposite question: what did printing not achieve? To answer part of this large and complicated question is to view the mid-fifteenth-century book not as a printed book to which maimscript marks were added, but as a book parts of which were printed. It singles out for attention what we may term transitional books such as the two-volume Bible c:Ompleted by Schaeffer in 1462, in which some ofthe headings and large initi~s were printed, and some were not. 37 The linaitations of early printing have their own inaportance, and without appreciating them it is impossible to·understan~ how books were conceived, read and used. C. In all this, it is historically inappropriate to think, as has one recent writer, offifteenth-centuryprinting as 'a consciously inferior or imitative process'.38 Thus to ~quate two adjectives conveying quite different values betrays an insensitivity ofjudgemeht that is wholly inappropriate to the fifteenth century. This is so for several reasons, and other writers have shown more finesse in understanding the Aristotelian underpinning oflate-medievalandhumanc ist understanding of inaitation. 39 For the artist, copying was both a means of learning and a rrieans to further invention.40 The mnltiple versions ofpaintings by Dirk Bouts, Rogier van der Weyden, Robert Campin and others all witness. to sinailarly .complex values.

Giovanni Andrea Bussi regarded it in 1468 as sancta em, de Lignamine, a native probably of Messina, and owner in Rome during the 1470s, wrote ofthisdivina ars.

Imitation- as Cenninl in the late fourteenth century- was itselfan accomplishment Indeed, humanism itself, including interest in roman and was in large part driven by emulation of antiquity as a Biihler put it many years ago, and as still needs to·~be repeated, of the earliest printing would be well advised if he viewed the as the first printers did, as simply another form of writing',44 used for the printed and manuscript volume were interchange· volumen, exemplar, codex.

between process and appearance, printing and lettering: <ars illa mirabilis & prius inaudita imprimendi & characterizandi libros'Y The new terms, that were of necessity introduced, described the process: impressus, stampa, chalcographus. 48 They referred to the mechanics and materials of produc· tion, not to the shape of the finished article or to its appearance. And yet the historical fallacy persists, in uncritical contrasts of writing with printing. One widely read textbook remarks that 'early printers certainly tried to make their books look as much like manuscripts as possible.' 49 Greetham repeats the point later, extending the; confusion: The old, familiar late-gothic letters of contemporary fifteenth-century manuscripts and the lack of title-page and of pagination, the removal of information. about the printing of the book to the colophon at the end - all of this demonstrated that printers were trying to make their books look as much like manuscrip~ as possible (even, on occasion, using parchment rather than paper, in an iro'nic denial of the cost-saving per copy which was from the beginning one of the rllajor desiderata for printing as opposed to scribal copying).50

This inversion of history (assuming tl]e necessity of a title-page, a later de, velopment), the assumption concerning colophons (save for the Catholicon none of the books attributable to Gutenberg bears a colophon; and its even- _ tual regularisation in printed books, where in ma':mscripts the practice had never been general, was a direct result of th~ needs of the trade specifically in printed books), the assumption that colophons had themselves been 'removed' (from where is not clear}, and the underestimating of the ways in which vellum or parchment co'/!d be used to very different purposes in manuscripts and printed books alike, all betray misunderstanding. Another study of the place of print in the renaissance observes that 'The vellum Gutenberg Bible, for example, was deliberately made to look like a manuscript.'51 Yet another alleges that 'Ifone holds a late manuscript copy of a given rert neXt to an early printed one, one is likely to doubt that any change at all has taken place.' 52 To phrase matters thus is profoundly to misjudge the complexity and yet the underlying simplicity of the relationship between manuscript and print in the mid-fifteenth century. Both were, simply, ways of making books. l:jor the vast majority of printed books very significant changes,are, in fact,,inunediatdy observable, 'in (for example, and at a quite basiclevel) the alignment of type and its more regular spatial organ:isatiou inte "Columns.

points, and in particular to introduce red or other colours, in this and many books published subsequently, was more economical than to employ type and the press. To use printed colour for a heirarchy of reference was technically difficult, and expensive; change only became generally feasible once printers owned or had access to type in a sufficient range of sizes or styles. Though experiments with large initial letters were made from the first, as another of the several means by which the reader was gnided, such letters were also added to printed pages by hand well into the sixteenth century. Printed folio or page numbers, like printed signaturem'!<ks and catchwords, were late developments, in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, 56 not because they were unwanted (the ample evidence of manuscripts makes it clear that they were in common nse long before they were printed), but for technical reasons. They fell outside the main type area of tlie printed page, and beyond the available space under the platen of the press: to print quire signatures, sufficiently clear of the text, was often impossible ~ause the platen of the press was too small, and in some early printed books they were stamped in separately. 57 For binders, catchwords and signature marks were written or stamped in. Tbe ae<;eptance that such guides migbt be printed with the main type area was a major aesthetic concession to the demands of the press, and acknowledgement of a manufacm:ing convenience. In similar fashion, printed page headings replaced those in manuscript, and became more widely used, only by slow degrees. In all of these different features of page layout, the process of change fro~ manuscript to print was a gradual one, though in each case we are dealing also with printed, rather than manuscript, books. Demands for maps, diagrams of all kinds, technically ambitious features such as volvelles, sorts not available within the typographical resources of a particular printer: all were readily and easily answered in manuscript. 58 ../ In 1469, Ulrich Han, possessing no Greek type when he printed Cicero's Tusculanae quaestiones, "left spaces into which it could be written.59 In 1579, the Edinburgh printer John Ross similarly left spaces into which Greek or Hebrew was written (fig. 3).60 Lingnistic needs had to be inet as well.

Considerable research is still required before we shall understand to whlll l'k tent the local conventions of rubrication or decoration might in some have been influenced by local habits of reading, and how far the dis:tincti·llllj were deemed to be practical ones rather than aesthetic. How far, iri other words, did the expectations of manuscripts into printed books not just in matters of taste and decoration, but also use? How far, indeed, may these two be considered e issues? 63 relevant ere to recall par e typographical questions, and Paul Needl~arn' observation, based on the work of Georg Heinrich Pertz and G .I.

Music printing offers a microcosm of the ways in whicll technical available equipment and customer need were accommodated one with I other.

printed by Conrad Winters at Cologne in about 1482 was left with very substantial white space for extra text, and the few surviving copies testify to a range of purchasers and users in England and Germanyn The Basel printer Michael Wenssler was equipped to print music, but his books also display pages printed with or without staves or notes, the variation in practice seemingly having no bearing on tbe chronology ofhis.press. 79 Such books are reminders of ways in which, in a highly specialist market, the printer adjusts two traditions: manuscript and print. Their complementary nature, and the flexibility that each allows the other, in manufacture or in circulation, further emphasises the nature of their joint existence and interdependence. The bibliography of music is technically complicated by the, gradual development ofmeans to print staves and notes by letterpress, and with this the separate development of mensural notation. 80 But it is linked with readers in a manner quite unlike other literary forms. Music is intended to be read in performance; and since performance depends on interpretation, in the most obvious of ways, so the modern reader (or in this case, also the performer) will still today expect to annotate the score. For ensemble playing or singing, such annotation is essential if there is to be agreement between the performers as to details of phrasing, tempi, etc,)n other wor4s, we see here not simply the ordinary intercourse between author, manufacturer and reader, but the firm knowledge and unavoidable expectation on the part of the author (composer) that the reader t.Performer) will bring his or her own circumstantial needs, besides inclination, experience and interpretation. Whatever instructions the composer or editor may give as to tempi, volume, or e_ven.instruments, the performer becomes, for the audience, a part of the creation (or, if you will, 'authoring') of a piece ofmusic. The principle becomes still further complicated in orchestral performance, in the interplay between conductor and instrumentalists. Listeners and the circmnstances of performance introduce other series of variants; but I am concerned here to remind ourselves of the necessity, in performance, of adding manuscript to print, and so inevitably recording variations within !Qe terrain- musical or otherwise textual- permitted by the printed marks. The score annotated by a performer or ~onductor is quite unlike the marginal notes made by an . / individual in more 'ordinary' books, in that it comes at a point before the author's{composer's) work is delivered to the reader.(audience). ··: :. ·Printe.d· matter is .to be found inserted oin manuscripts of many subjects; On·the other· hand, some printed· matter was prepared specifically for· manuscripts, ;either.already<existing or even (it may reasonably be supposed),yet'to ·b.e·written;· '!:he· Canon missae printed.byFust anol Schoeffer at Main~ in 1457/8 was advertised ·as a separate-publication, which coufd- by

Moreover, and to repeat what has already been the printing revolution itself, a phrase taken to heart by some wus no revolution in the sense that it wrought instant change. and soprolonged, and like many revolutions its progress was irregular, '· were variable, even erratic.

We may go further, and state the case rcefully. Manuscripts often depended on printing. Aspects of the weaknesses of the early printing anp publishing trade are ·lv 1,;"'",1 by the existence of manuscripts written well after the pubwidely printed texts. This phenomenon has been highlighted in thanks to the existence of the catalogues of dated and datable 90 These. same catalogues have drawn further attention to the llun·uS<:rip·ts that were copied from printed books - usually (though ll!riably) because no further printed ropy was available to the enscopyist. The scale of this phenomenon has still to be assessed, and certainly underestinoated at present. The reasons forthe copying books were no doubt many. 91 Unavailability of texts in partic)Culliti<~s, preferences of taste, chance and, individual circumstance all their part.

On the other hand, it was not unknown for these very colophons to lw transcribed, word by word. Accordingly, there are anomalous colophonN such as that in the copy of Albrecht von Eyb's Margarita poetica now in New College, datable between 1475 and 1480 and copied in England from the Rome edition of 1475, we are told, 'non calamo: ereove stilo: sed notw
artis ac solerti industrie genere Rome impressa' (fig. 6). 93 Nonsense in OIW

sense, but clear indication of the indifference of the copyist to one medium rather than another. In this instance, the colophon was added probably aN an afterthought, since the hand is different from the main text, and the leaf has been separately ruled for the purpose. Printed and manuscript copies sat amongst each other. The manuscript ofWalter Hilton's Scale ofperfediou now in Trinity College, Cambridge, was written at Sheen in 1499 ~five yean · after Wynkyn de Warde had printed the same text only a few miles away in London. Yet its earliest known owner, who collated several copies ofthis best· selling text, used de Warde's edition for his editorial work. 94 In Germany, the Latin Bibles written out after the mid-1?o50s all have to~- considered in the light of Gutenberg, Schaeffer and their soccessors. Perhaps its innovative nature·made the 42-line Bible especially attractive, copies apparently being · , ' sold so rapidly that Silvio was unable to obtain one even in March 1455. The subsequent succession of printed folio Bibles during the 1460s and early 1470s95 coincides with contilluing manuscript production that is in part at least an economic response to inadequate supply. A lectern Bible written at Wiirzburg in' the late 1460sor early 1470s attests to continuing need not met by the new printed books. 96 A small folio Bible written in Schmolln, in northeast Germany, in 1460, found its way south to the Charterhouse at Erfurt by the mid-1470s, but it.seems to have enjoyed very little useY 7 On the other hand, the continuing power and attractiveness of quite ordinary manuscript copies of standard texts is attested by the great number of survivals dating ·from the last decades of the !ifteenth century. This par.ticular phenomenon is the more notable in the context of a printing trade which in some areas was over-producing and insufficiently organised to accomplish the prompt distribution of its output.

of many people, in libraries and the book trade alike, who saw in such ruptures. It was not simply that manuscript and printed were divorced. The widespread practice ofbinding up manuscripts of i·!IIIUe:nsJLOUtS according to individual need or taste, well-established in 'fi~:eettth century, was just one of many habits that did not die with the of the printed book. The Sammelband, assembled by owner, librarbinder, was a feature familiar to libraries of all sizes, and offers its ·~01mnaer1ta;ry on ways of thought. By dismantling such volumes, the thread is broken. happily, many volumes survive as witnesses of the ways in which and print were used, and often made, side by side. The volume St John's College, Oxford, containing three more or less contembooks printed by Caxton and a manuscript of Lydgate's Siege was closely connected with Caxton's own circles. 107 Private concould be as important as any intellectual or contemporary relabetween the two covers of a volume. One book from the house Br,,th,ren of the Common Life in Cologne offers suggestive evidence an early fifteenth -c"'ntury French manuscript with an edition Chrysostom printed at Brussels in 1479. 108 A 'copy of a Psalter for use printed by the Brethren of the Common Life at Brussel~ was up into a manuscript Breviary belonging to the Nazareth community itself, the printed text adjusted to different local use by means illt·ed-·on slips of paper: the rubrication for both parts is in the same and it is probable that the two parts have been together since the 109 A volume from the library of the AugustiniaJ;J. canons near contains a group of tracts by Bonaventura written out by the scribe de Ympens, and a printed copy of Nicolaus de Ha~apis' Biblia paupeprinted atAntwerp in 149!. 110 A.Putch Plenarium, printed byGovaert t Antwerp in 1496, was provided at an early date with extra narratives Passion and gospels for various days, in a book used by a woman ''"'c<m.m A copy of Terence printed by Mentelin at Strasburg in about was supplemented by extra leaves including a life of the dramatist and !Ulllents to the plays- the whole volume being rubricated in the. same throughout. 112 In libraries, manuscript and print were shelved side by side, and the early Dl!:tc<:nt]h-c:entury libr·ary catalogue of Syon monastery makes abundantly Jlloin how manuscript and printed works co-existed on an equal footing.

as one.

j

In volume after volume, manuscript and print are to be found con· joined even in the mid-seventeenth century, when the political press was a supplement to what was circulated privately, in manuscript. 114 Private need frequendy was at odds with the printing press, and vice-versa. Printed sheets were added to manuscripts, and manuscript leaves were pasted into printed volumes. & late as about 1625, the (probably) Parisian owner of a manuscript Horae, identifiable now only by the initials C S on the covers, arranged to have his or her prayer book rebound. The manuscrip~ a run-of-the-mill example from a late-fifteenth-cerlt1Iryworkshop, and it was now incorporated between the engraved tide-page of L'office de Ia Vierge, and (at the end) the Jesuit Pierre Colon's Oraisons devotes appropriees a toutes sortes d' exercices & actions Chrestiennes, both published by the Paris bookseller Louis Boullenger in 162S.ll5 Simllar '!dmixtures can be f~und amongst literature of most kinds in the eighteenth century. But it is in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries that this cohabitation is at its most instructive, at a time when each might supplement or complement the other- manuscripts supplementing print, and print supplementing manuscript. In this two-way process there was, and is, no reason to regard one as being superior to the other, or one as being more old-fashioned. The social and e<;onomic factors that played so large a part in the demise of manuscript for most publication are much ' less in evidence when we look at the specific records of private needs and
interests:

A health director . . . reported this week that a small mouse, which presumably had been watching television, attacked a little girl and her full-grown cat. . . . Both mouse and cat survived, and the incident is recorded here as a reminder that things seem to be changing. A f t e r three thousand years o f explosion, b y means o f fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the Wester n w o r l d is imploding . D u r i n g the mechanical ages w e had extended our bodies i n space. T o day, after more than a century o f elect r i c technology, w e have extended o u r central nervous system itself i n a global embrace, abolishing b o t h space and time as far as our planet is concerned. R a p i d l y , w e approach the final phase o f the extensions of man--the technological simulation o f consciousness, w h e n the creative process o f k n o w i n g w i l l be collectively and cor-

porately extended to the w h o l e o f human society, m u c h as w e have already extended our senses and our nerves b y the various media. W h e t h e r the extension of consciousness, so l o n g sought b y advertisers f o r specific products, w i l l be "a good t h i n g " is a question that admits o f a w i d e solution. T h e r e is little possibility of answering such questions about the extensions o f man w i t h o u t considering all o f t h e m together. A n y extension, whether o f skin, hand, or f o o t , affects the w h o l e psychic and social complex. Some o f the principal extensions, together w i t h some of their psychic and social consequences, are studied i n this book. Just h o w l i t t l e consideration has been given to such matters i n the past can be gathered f r o m the consternation o f one o f the editors of this book. H e noted i n dismay that "seventy-five per cent of y o u r material is new. A successful book cannot venture to be more than ten per cent n e w . " Such a risk seems quite w o r t h taking at the present t i me w h e n the stakes are v e r y high, and the need t o understand the effects of the extensions o f man becomes more u r gent b y the hour. I n the mechanical age n o w receding, many actions could be taken w i t h o u t too m u c h concern. Slow movement insured that the reactions w e r e delayed f o r considerable periods o f time. T o d a y the action and the reaction occur almost at the same time. W e actually live m y t h i c a l l y and integrally, as i t were, b u t w e continue t o t h i n k i n the o l d , fragmented space and t i m e patterns of the pre-electric age. W e s t e r n man acquired f r o m the technology of literacy the p o w e r t o act w i t h o u t reacting. T h e advantages o f fragmenting himself i n this w a y are seen i n the case o f the surgeon w h o w o u l d be quite helpless i f he were t o become humanly involved i n his operation. W e acquired the art o f c a r r y i n g o u t the most dangerous social operations w i t h complete detachment. B u t our detachment was a posture o f noninvolvement. I n the electric age, w h e n our central nervous system is technologically extended to involve us i n the w h o l e of m a n k i n d and t o incorporate the whole of mankind i n us, w e necessarily participate, i n depth, i n the consequences o f our every action. I t is no longer possible to adopt the aloof and dissociated role o f the literate Westerner.

Introduction/S T h e Theater o f the A b s u r d dramatizes this recent dilemma o f Western man, the man o f action w h o appears n o t to be involved i n the action. Such is the o r i g i n and appeal o f Samuel Beckett's clowns. A f t e r three thousand years of specialist explosion and o f increasing specialism and alienation i n the technological extensions o f our bodies, our w o r l d has become compressional b y dramatic reversal. As electrically contracted, the globe is no more than a village. Electric speed i n b r i n g i n g all social and political functions together i n a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness o f responsibility t o an intense degree. I t is this implosive factor that alters the position o f the N e g r o , the teen-ager, and some other groups. T h e y can no longer be contained, i n the political sense o f limited association. T h e y are n o w involved i n our lives, as w e i n theirs, thanks to the electric media. T h i s is the A g e o f A n x i e t y f o r the reason of the electric implosion that compels commitment and participation, quite regardless o f any " p o i n t of v i e w . " T h e partial and specialized character o f the v i e w p o i n t , however noble, w i l l n o t serve at all i n the electric age. A t the i n f o r m a t i o n level the same upset has occurred w i t h the substitution o f the inclusive image f o r the mere viewpoint. I f the nineteenth c e n t u r y was the age of the editorial chair, ours is the century o f the psychiatrist's couch. As extension o f man the chair is a specialist ablation of the posterior, a sort of ablative absolute of backside, whereas the couch extends the integral being. T h e psychiatrist employs the couch, since i t removes the temptation t o express private points o f v i e w and obviates the need t o rationalize events. T h e aspiration o f our time f o r wholeness, empathy and depth o f awareness is a natural adjunct o f electric technology. T h e age o f mechanical i n d u s t r y that preceded us f o u n d vehement assert i o n o f private o u t l o o k the natural mode o f expression. E v e r y c u l ture and every age has its favorite model o f perception and knowledge that i t is inclined t o prescribe f o r everybody and everyt h i n g . T h e mark o f o u r time is its revulsion against imposed patterns. W e are suddenly eager t o have things and people declare their beings t o t a l l y . T h e r e is a deep f a i t h t o be f o u n d i n this new attitude--a faith that concerns the ultimate harmony o f all

being. Such is the faith i n w h i c h this book has been w r i t t e n . I t explores the contours o f our o w n extended beings i n our technologies, seeking the principle o f i n t e l l i g i b i l i ty i n each o f them. I n the f u l l confidence that i t is possible t o w i n an understanding o f these forms that w i l l b r i n g them into o r d e r l y service, I have looked at them anew, accepting v e r y little of the conventional wisdom concerning them. One can say o f media as R o b e rt T h e o bald has said o f economic depressions: " T h e r e is one additional factor that has helped to c o n t r o l depressions, and that is a better understanding of their development." Examination of the origin and development o f the individual extensions o f man should be preceded b y a look at some general aspects of the media, or extensions o f man, beginning w i t h the never-explained numbness that each extension brings about i n the individual and society.

1 The Medium Is the Message

I n a culture like ours, l o n g accustomed t o splitting and d i v i d i n g all things as a means o f c o n t r o l , i t is sometimes a b i t o f a shock t o be reminded that, i n operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. T h i s is merely t o say that the personal and social consequences o f any medium--that is, o f any extension of ourselves--result f r o m the new scale that is introduced into our affairs b y each extension of ourselves, or b y any ne w technology. T h u s , w i t h automation, f o r example, the new patterns o f human association tend t o eliminate jobs, i t is true. T h a t is the negative result. Positively, automation creates roles f o r people, w h i c h is t o say depth o f involvement i n their w o r k and human association that our preceding mechanical technolo g y had destroyed. M a n y people w o u l d be disposed t o say that i t was n o t the machine, b u t w h a t one d i d w i t h the machine, that was its meaning or message. I n terms of the ways i n w h i c h the machine

Media

altered our relations t o one another and to ourselves, i t mattered n o t i n the least whether i t t u r n e d o u t cornflakes or Cadillacs. T h e restructuring o f human w o r k and association was shaped b y the technique o f fragmentation that is the essence o f machine technology. T h e essence o f automation technology is the opposite. I t is integral and decentralist i n depth, just as the machine was f r a g mentary, centralist, and superficial i n its patterning of human relationships. T h e instance o f the electric l i g h t m a y prove illuminating i n this connection. T h e electric l i g h t is pure i n f o r m a t i o n . I t is a medium w i t h o u t a message, as i t were, unless i t is used t o spell out some verbal ad or name. T h i s fact, characteristic o f all media, means that the " c o n t e n t " o f any mediu m is always another medium. T h e content o f w r i t i n g is speech, just as the w r i t t e n w o r d is the content o f p r i n t , and p r i n t is the content o f the telegraph. I f i t is asked, " W h a t is the content o f speech?," i t is necessary t o say, " I t is an actual process o f thought , w h i c h is i n itself nonverbal." A n abstract painting represents direct manifestation o f creative t h o u g h t processes as they m i g h t appear i n computer designs. W h a t w e are considering here, however, are the psychic and social consequences o f the designs or patterns as they a m p l i f y or accelerate existing processes. F or the "message" of any medium or technology is the change o f scale or pace or pattern that i t introduces i n t o human affairs. T h e r a i l w a y d i d n o t i n t r o duce movement or transportation or wheel or road into human society, b u t i t accelerated and enlarged the scale of previous human functions, creating t o t a l l y new kinds o f cities and new kinds o f w o r k and leisure.

I t could be argued that these activities are i n some w a y the " c o n t e n t " o f the electric l i g h t , since they c o u l d n o t exist w i t h o u t the electric light. T h i s fact merely underlines the p o i n t that "the medium is the message" because i t is the m e d i u m that shapes and controls the scale and f o r m o f human association and action. T h e content or uses o f such media are as diverse as they are ineffectual in shaping the f o r m o f human association. Indeed, i t is o n l y too typical that the " c o n t e n t " o f any m e d i u m blinds us t o the character o f the medium. I t is o n l y today that industries have become aware o f the various kinds o f business i n w h i c h t h e y are engaged. W h e n I B M discovered that i t was n o t i n the business o f making office equipment or business machines, b u t that i t was i n the business o f processing i n f o r m a t i o n , then i t began to navigate w i t h clear vision. T h e General Electric Company makes a considerable p o r t i o n o f its profits f r o m electric l i g h t bulbs and l i g h t i n g systems. I t has n o t y e t discovered that, quite as m u c h as A . T . & T . , i t is i n the business of m o v i n g i n f o r m a t i o n . T h e electric l i g h t escapes attention as a communication medium just because i t has no "content. " A n d this makes i t an invaluable instance o f h o w people fail t o study media at all. F o r i t is n o t t i l l the electric l i g h t is used t o spell out some brand name that i t is noticed as a medium. T h e n i t is n o t the l i g h t b u t the " c o n t e n t " ( o r w h a t is really another m e d i u m ) that is noticed. T h e message o f the electric l i g h t is l i k e the message o f electric p o w e r i n industry, t o t a l l y radical, pervasive, and decentralized. F o r electric light and p o w e r are separate f r o m their uses, y e t t h e y eliminate time and space factors i n human association exactly as do radio, telegraph, telephone, and T V , creating involvement i n depth.

lines that bespeak Shakespeare's i n t u i t i o n o f the transforming powers of n e w media: Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abus'd? Have y o u not read Roderigo, O f some such thing? I n Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, w h i c h is almost completely devoted t o b o t h a psychic and social study of communication, Shakespeare states his awareness that true social and political navigation depend u p o n anticipating the consequences of i n novation: The providence that's i n a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold, Finds bottom i n the uncomprehensive deeps, Keeps place w i t h thought, and almost like the gods Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles. T h e increasing awareness o f the action o f media, quite i n dependently of their " c o n t e n t " or p r o g r a m m i n g, was indicated i n the annoyed and anonymous stanza: I n modern thought, ( i f not i n fact) Nothing is that doesn't act, So that is reckoned wisdom which Describes the scratch but not the itch. T h e same k i n d o f total, configurational awareness that reveals w h y the m e d i u m is socially the message has occurred i n the most recent and radical medical theories. I n his Stress of Life, Hans Selye tells of the dismay o f a research colleague o n hearing o f Selye's t h e o r y : W h e n he saw me thus launched on yet another enraptured description of what I had observed i n animals treated w i t h this or that impure, toxic material, he looked at me w i t h desperately sad eyes and said i n obvious despair: "But Selye, t r y to realize what you are doing before i t is too late!

As Selye deals w i t h the total environmental situation i n his "stress" theory o f disease, so the latest approach t o media study considers not o n l y the " c o n t e n t " b u t the mediu m and the cultural matrix w i t h i n w h i c h the particular m e d i u m operates. T h e older unawareness of the psychic and social effects o f media can be illustrated f r o m almost any o f the conventional pronouncements. I n accepting an honorary degree f r o m the U n i v e r s i t y o f N o t r e Dame a f e w years ago, General D a v i d SarnofF made this statement: " W e are too prone t o make technological instruments the scapegoats f o r the sins o f those w h o w i e l d them. T h e products o f modern science are n o t i n themselves good or bad; i t is the w a y they are used that determines their value." T h a t is the voice o f the current somnambulism. Suppose w e were t o say, " A p p l e pie is i n itself neither good nor bad; i t is the w a y i t is used that determines its value." O r , " T h e smallpox virus is i n itself neither good n o r bad; i t is the w a y i t is used that determines its value." A g a i n , "Firearms are i n themselves neither good nor bad; i t is the w a y they are used that determines their value." T h a t is, i f the slugs reach the r i g h t people firearms are good. I f the T V tube fires the r i g h t ammunition at the r i g h t people i t is good. I am n o t being perverse. T h e r e is s i m p l y n o t h i n g i n the Sarnoff statement that w i l l bear scrutiny, f o r i t ignores the nature o f the medium, o f any and all media, i n the true Narcissus style o f one hypnotized b y the amputation and extension o f his o w n being i n a n e w technical f o r m ! General Sarnoff w e n t o n t o explain his attitude t o the technology of p r i n t , saying that i t was true that p r i n t caused m u c h trash t o circulate, b u t i t had also disseminated the Bible and the thoughts o f seers and philosophers. I t has never occurred t o General Sarnoff that any technology c o u l d do a n y t h i n g b u t add itself o n t o w h a t w e already are. Such economists as Robert Theobald, W . W . Rostow, and John Kenneth Galbraith have been explaining f o r years h o w i t is that "classical economics" cannot explain change or g r o w t h . A n d the paradox o f mechanization is that although i t is itself the cause o f maximal g r o w t h and change, the principle o f mechanization excludes the v e r y possibility of g r o w t h or the understanding o f change. For mechanization is achieved b y fragmentation of any

process and b y p u t t i n g the fragmented parts i n a series. Yet, as D a v i d H u m e showed i n the eighteenth century, there is no principle o f causality i n a mere sequence. T h a t one t h i n g follows another accounts f o r n o t h i n g . N o t h i n g f o l l o w s f r o m f o l l o w i n g , except change. So the greatest o f all reversals occurred w i t h electricity, that ended sequence b y making things instant. W i t h instant speed the causes o f things began t o emerge t o awareness again, as they had n o t done w i t h things i n sequence and i n concatenation accordingly. Instead o f asking w h i c h came first, the chicken o r the egg, i t suddenly seemed that a chicken was an egg's idea f o r getting more eggs. Just before an airplane breaks the sound barrier, sound waves become visible o n the wings of the plane. T h e sudden visibility o f sound just as sound ends is an apt instance of that great pattern o f being that reveals new and opposite forms just as the earlier forms reach their peak performance. Mechanization was never so v i v i d l y fragmented or sequential as i n the b i r t h o f the movies, the moment that translated us beyond mechanism i n t o the w o r l d o f g r o w t h and organic interrelation. T h e movie, b y sheer speeding u p the mechanical, carried us f r o m the w o r l d o f sequence and connections i n t o the w o r l d o f creative configuration and structure. T h e message o f the movie medium is that o f transition f r o m lineal connections t o configurations. I t is the transition that produced the n o w quite correct observation: " I f i t w o r k s , it's obsolete." W h e n electric speed f u r t h e r takes over f r o m mechanical movie sequences, then the lines o f force i n structures and i n media become l o u d and clear. W e r e t u r n t o the inclusive f o r m of the i c o n . T o a h i g h l y literate and mechanized culture the movie appeared as a w o r l d o f t r i u m p h a n t illusions and dreams that money could b u y . I t was at this m o m e n t o f the movie that cubism occurred, and i t has been described b y E. H . G o m b r i c h (Art and Illusion) as " t h e most radical attempt t o stamp out ambiguit y and t o enforce one reading of the picture--that o f a man-made construction, a colored canvas." F o r cubism substitutes all facets of an object simultaneously f o r the " p o i n t o f v i e w " or facet o f perspective illusion. Instead o f the specialized illusion o f the t h i r d

The

dimension on canvas, cubism sets up an interplay o f planes and contradiction or dramatic conflict o f patterns, lights, textures that "drives home the message" b y involvement. T h i s is held b y many to be an exercise i n painting, n o t i n illusion. I n other words, cubism, b y giving the inside and outside, the top, b o t t o m , back, and f r o n t and the rest, i n t w o dimensions, drops the illusion of perspective i n favor o f instant sensory awareness o f the w h o l e . Cubism, b y seizing o n instant total awareness, suddenly announced that the medium is the message. Is i t n o t evident that the moment that sequence yields t o the simultaneous, one is i n the w o r l d o f the structure and o f configuration? Is that n o t w h a t has happened i n physics as i n painting, p o e t r y , and i n communication? Specialized segments o f attention have shifted t o total field, and w e can n o w say, " T h e m e d i u m is the message" quite naturally. Before the electric speed and t o t a l field, i t was n o t obvious that the medium is the message. T h e message, i t seemed, was the " c o n t e n t , " as people used t o ask w h a t a painting was abotét. Y e t t h e y never thought to ask w h a t a m e l o dy was about, nor w h a t a house or a dress was about. I n such matters, people retained some sense of the w h o l e pattern, o f f o r m and f u n c t i o n as a u n i t y . B u t i n the electric age this integral idea o f structure and configuration has become so prevalent that educational t h e o r y has taken u p the matter. Instead o f w o r k i n g w i t h specialized "problems" i n a r i t h metic, the structural approach n o w f o l l o w s the linea o f force i n the field o f number and has small children meditating about n u m ber theory and "sets." Cardinal N e w m a n said o f Napoleon, " H e understood the grammar o f g u n p o w d e r . " Napoleo n had paid some attention t o other media as w e l l , especially the semaphore telegraph that gave h i m a great advantage over his enemies. H e is o n record f o r saying that " T h r e e hostile newspapers are m o r e t o be feared than a thousand bayonets." Alexis de Tocqueville was the first t o master the grammar o f p r i n t and t y p o g r a p h y . H e was thus able t o read off the message o f c o m i n g change i n France and America as i f he were reading aloud f r o m a text that had been handed t o h i m . In, fact, the nineteenth century i n France and i n A m e r i c a was just such an

open book t o de Tocqueville because he had learned the grammar o f p r i n t . So he, also, k n e w w h e n that grammar d i d n o t apply. H e was asked w h y he d i d n o t w r i t e a book o n England, since he k n e w and admired England. H e replied: One would have to have an unusual degree of philosophical folly to believe oneself able to judge England i n six months. A year always seemed to me too short a time i n which to appreciate the United States properly, and i t is much easier to acquire clear and precise notions about the American Union than about Great Britain. I n America all laws derive in a sense f r o m the same line of thought. The whole of society, so to speak, is founded upon a single fact; everything springs f r o m a simple principle. One could compare America to a forest pierced by a multitude of straight roads all converging on the same point. One has only to find the center and everything is revealed at a glance. But i n England the paths r u n criss-cross, and i t is only by travelling down each one of them that one can build up a picture of the whole. D e Tocqueville, i n earlier w o r k o n the French Revolution, had explained h o w i t was the p r i n t e d w o r d that, achieving cultural saturation i n the eighteenth century, had homogenized the French nation. Frenchmen were the same k i n d o f people f r o m n o r t h t o south. T h e typographic principles o f u n i f o r m i t y , c o n t i n u i t y , and lineality had overlaid the complexities of ancient feudal and oral society. T h e R e v o l u t i on was carried o u t b y the n e w literati and lawyers. I n England, however, such was the power of the ancient oral traditions o f c o m m o n law, backed b y the medieval institution o f Parliament, that no u n i f o r m i t y or c o n t i n u i t y o f the n e w visual p r i n t culture could take complete hold. T h e result was that the most i m p o r t a n t event i n English history has never taken place; namely, the English Revolution o n the lines of the French Revolut i o n . T h e A m e r i c a n Revolution had no medieval legal institutions t o discard or t o r o o t out, apart f r o m monarchy. A n d many have held that the America n Presidency has become v e r y m u c h more personal and monarchical than any European monarch ever could be. De Tocqueville's contrast between England and America

is clearly based o n the fact o f t y p o g r a p h y and o f p r i n t culture creating u n i f o r m i t y and c o n t i n u i t y . England, he says, has rejected this principle and clung t o the dynamic or oral common-law tradition. Hence the discontinuity and unpredictable qualit y o f English culture. T h e grammar o f p r i n t cannot help t o construe the message of oral and n o n w r i t t e n culture and institutions. T h e English aristocracy was p r o p e r l y classified as barbarian b y M a t t h e w A r n o l d because its power and status had n o t h i n g t o do w i t h literacy or w i t h the cultural forms o f t y p o g r a p h y . Said the D u k e of Gloucester t o E d w a r d G i b b o n u p o n the publication o f his Decline and Fall: " A n o t h e r damned fat book, eh, M r . G i b bon? Scribble, scribble, scribble, eh, M r . G i b b o n ? " De T o c q u e ville was a h i g h l y literate aristocrat w h o was quite able to be detached f r o m the values and assumptions o f t y p o g r a p h y. T h a t is w h y he alone understood the grammar of t y p o g r a p h y. A n d i t is o n l y on those terms, standing aside f r o m any structure or medium , that its principles and lines o f force can be discerned. For any medium has the p o w e r o f imposing its o w n assumption o n the u n w a r y . Prediction and c o n t r o l consist i n avoiding this subliminal state o f Narcissus trance. B u t the greatest aid t o this end is simply i n k n o w i n g that the spell can occur immediately u p o n contact, as i n the first bars o f a melody. A Passage to India b y E. M . Forster is a dramatic study o f the i n a b i l i ty of oral and i n t u i t i v e oriental culture t o meet w i t h the rational, visual European patterns of experience. "Rational," o f course, has f o r the W e s t l o n g meant " u n i f o r m and continuous and sequential." I n other words, w e have confused reason w i t h literacy, and rationalism w i t h a single technology. T h u s i n the electric age man seems t o the conventional W e s t t o become irrational.

T h e ultimate conflict between sight and sound, between w r i t t e n and oral kinds o f perception and organization o f existence is u p o n us. Since understanding stops action, as Nietzsche observed, w e can moderate the fierceness o f this conflict b y understanding the media that extend us and raise these wars w i t h i n and w i t h o u t us. Detribalization b y literacy and its traumatic effects o n tribal man is the theme o f a book b y the psychiatrist J. C. Carothers, The African Mind in Health and Disease ( W o r l d H e a l t h O r g a n i zation, Geneva, 1953). M u c h o f his material appeared i n an article i n Psychiatry magazine, November, 1 9 5 9 : " T h e Culture, Psychiatry, and the W r i t t e n W o r d . " A g a i n , i t is electric speed that has revealed the lines o f force operating f r o m W e s t e r n technology i n the remotest areas o f bush, savannah, and desert. One example is the Bedouin w i t h his battery radio o n board the camel. Subm e r g i n g natives w i t h floods o f concepts f o r w h i c h n o t h i n g has prepared them is the normal action o f all o f our technology. B u t w i t h electric media W e s t e r n man himself experiences exactly the same inundation as the remote native. W e are no more prepared t o encounter radio and T V i n our literate milieu than the native o f Ghana is able t o cope w i t h the literacy that takes h i m o u t o f his collective t r i b a l w o r l d and beaches h i m i n individual isolation. W e are as n u m b i n our n e w electric w o r l d as the native involve d i n our literate and mechanical culture. Electric speed mingles the cultures o f prehistory w i t h the dregs o f industrial marketeers, the nonliterate w i t h the semiliterate and the postliterate.

the American w a y of life was f o r m e d . I t is, however, no time t o suggest strategies w h e n the threat has n o t even been a c k n o w l edged t o exist. I am i n the position o f Louis Pasteur telling doctors that their greatest enemy was quite invisible, and quite unrecognized b y them. O u r conventional response to all media, namely that i t is h o w the y are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the " c o n t e n t " of a m e d i u m is like the j u i c y piece o f meat carried b y the burglar t o distract the w a t c h dog o f the m i n d . T h e effect o f the medium is made strong and intense just because i t is given another medium as "content." T h e content o f a movie is a novel or a play or an opera. T h e effect of the movie f o r m is not related t o its program content. T h e " c o n t e n t " o f w r i t i n g or p r i n t is speech, b u t the reader is almost entirely unaware either of p r i n t or o f speech. A r n o l d T o y n b e e is innocent o f any understanding o f media as they have shaped history, b u t he is f u l l of examples that the student o f media can use. A t one moment he can seriously suggest that adult education, such as the W o r k e r s Educational Associat i o n i n Britain, is a useful counterforce t o the popular press. T o y n bee considers that although all o f the oriental societies have i n our time accepted the industrial technology and its political consequences: " O n the cultural plane, however, there is no u n i f o r m corresponding tendency." (Somervell, I . 267) T h i s is like the voice of the literate man, floundering i n a milieu of ads, w h o boasts, "Personally, I pay no attention to ads." T h e spiritual and cultural reservations that the oriental peoples may have t o w a r d our technology w i l l avail them not at all. T h e effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, b u t alter sense ratios or patterns o f perception steadily and w i t h o u t any resistance. T h e serious artist is the o n l y person able t o encounter technology w i t h i m p u n i t y , just because he is an expert aware o f the changes i n sense perception.

irresistible revolution, culminating i n the breakdow n o f feudal government and the resumption of intercourse w i t h foreign countries after more than t w o hundred years o f seclusion." M o n e y has reorganized the sense life of peoples just because i t is an extension of our sense lives. Thi s change does n o t depend u p o n approval or disapproval o f those l i v i n g i n the society. A r n o l d T o y n b e e made one approach t o the transforming power o f media i n his concept of "etherialization," w h i c h he holds to be the principle of progressive simplification and efficiency i n any organization or technology. T y p i c a l l y , he is ignoring the effect o f the challenge o f these forms u p o n the response of our senses. H e imagines that i t is the response of our opinions that is relevant t o the effect o f media and technology i n society, a " p o i n t of v i e w " that is plainly the result of the t y p o graphic spell. For the man i n a literate and homogenized society ceases to be sensitive t o the diverse and discontinuous life of forms. H e acquires the illusion o f the t h i r d dimension and the "private point of v i e w " as part of his Narcissus fixation, and is quite shut off f r o m Blake's awareness or that o f the Psalmist, that w e become w h a t w e behold. T o d a y w h e n w e w a n t to get our bearings i n our o w n culture, and have need to stand aside f r o m the bias and pressure exerted b y any technical f o r m o f human expression, w e have o n l y to visit a society where that particular f o r m has n o t been felt, or a historical period i n w h i c h i t was u n k n o w n .

alism i n the sixteenth century. Program and " c o n t e n t " analysis offer no clues to the magic of these media or to their subliminal charge. Leonard D o o b , i n his repor t Communication in Africa, tells of one A f r i c a n w h o t o o k great pains t o listen each evening t o the BBC news, even t h o u g h he could understand n o t h i n g of i t . Just t o be i n the presence of those sounds at 7 P . M . each day was i m p o r t a n t f o r h i m . H i s attitude to speech was like ours t o melody--the resonant intonation was meaning enough. I n the seventeenth century our ancestors still shared this native's attitude t o the forms o f media, as is plain i n the f o l l o w i n g sentiment o f the Frenchman Bernard L a m expressed i n The Art of Speaking ( L o n d o n , 1696): 'Tis an effect of the Wisdom of God, who created Man to be happy, that whatever is useful to his conversation (way of life) is agreeable to him . . . because all victual that conduces to nourishment is relishable, whereas other things that cannot be assimulated and be turned into our substance are insipid. A Discourse cannot be pleasant to the Hearer that is not easie to the Speaker; nor can i t be easily pronounced unless i t be heard w i t h delight. H e r e is an equilibrium t h e o r y of human diet and expression such as even n o w w e are o n l y striving t o w o r k o u t again f o r media after centuries o f fragmentation and specialism. Pope Pius X I I was deeply concerned that there be serious study o f the media today. O n February 17, 1950, he said: I t is not an exaggeration to say that the future of modern society and the stability of its inner life depend i n large part on the maintenance of an equilibrium between the strength of the techniques of communication and the capacity of the individual's own reaction. Failure i n this respect has f o r centuries been t y p i c a l and total f o r m a n k i n d . Subliminal and docile acceptance o f media impact has made them prisons w i t h o u t walls f o r their human users. As A .

T h e result is that the present age has been one o f multiple civil wars that :irc n o t limited to the w o r l d o f art and entertainment. I n War and Human Progress, Professor J. U . N e f declared: " T h e total wars of our time have been the result of a series o f intellectual misrakes . . . " I f the formative p o w e r i n the media are the media themselves, that raises a host o f large matters that can o n l y be mentioned here, although t h e y deserve volumes. N a m e l y , that technological media are staples or natural resources, exactly as are coal and cotton and o i l . A n y b o d y w i l l concede that society whose econo m y is dependent u p o n one or t w o major staples like c o t t o n , or grain, or lumber, or fish, or cattle is going to have some o b vious social patterns o f organization as a result. Stress o n a f e w major staples creates extreme instability i n the economy b u t great endurance i n the population. T h e pathos and humor o f the A m e r i can South are embedded i n such an economy of limited staples. For a society configured b y reliance o n a f e w commodities accepts them as a social b o n d quite as m u c h as the metropolis does the press. C o t t o n and o i l , like radio and T V , become " f i x e d charges" on the entire psychic life o f the c o m m u n i t y . A n d this pervasive fact creates the unique cultural flavor o f any society. I t pays through the nose and all its other senses f o r each staple that shapes its life. T h a t our human senses, o f w h i c h all media are extensions, are also fixed charges on our personal energies, and that t h e y also configure the awareness and experience o f each one o f us, m a y be perceived i n another connection mentioned b y the psychologist C. G . Jung: Every Roman was surrounded by slaves. The slave and his psychology flooded ancient Italy, and every Roman became inwardly, and of course unwittingly, a slave. Because living constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected through the unconscious w i t h their psychology. N o one can shield himself f r o m such an influence (Contributions to Analytical Psychology, London, 1928).

T h e sensuous involvement natural to cultures i n w h i c h literacy is n o t the r u l i n g f o r m of experience is sometimes indicated i n travel guides, as i n this item f r o m a guide to Greece: You w i l l notice that many Greek men seem to spend a lot of time counting the beads of what appear to be amber rosaries. But these have no religious significance. They are komboloia or " w o r r y beads," a legacy f r o m the Turks, and Greeks click them on land, on the sea, i n the air to ward off that insupportable silence which threatens to reign whenever conversation lags. Shepherds do i t , cops do i t , stevedores and merchants in their shops do i t . A n d i f you wonder w h y so few Greek women wear beads, you'll know it's because their husbands have pre-empted them for the simple pleasure of clicking. More aesthetic than thumb-twiddling, less expensive than smoking, this Queeg-like obsession indicates a tactile sensuousness characteristic of a race which has produced the western world's greatest sculpture . . . W h e r e the heavy visual stress of literacy is lacking i n a culture, there occurs another f o r m o f sensuous involvement and cultural appreciation that our Greek guide explains whimsically: . . . do not be surprised at the frequency w i t h which you are patted, petted and prodded in Greece. You may end up feeling like the family dog . . . in an affectionate family. This propensity to pat seems to us a tactile extension of the avid Greek curiosity noted before. It's as though your hosts are trying to find out what you are made of. T h e w i d e l y separate characters of the spoken and w r i t t e n w o r d s are easy t o study today w h e n there is ever closer t o u c h w i t h nonliterate societies. One native, the o n l y literate member o f his group , t o l d o f acting as reader f o r the others w h e n they received letters. H e said he felt impelled to p u t his fingers to his ears w h i l e reading aloud, so as n o t t o violate the p r i v a c y o f their letters.

I t helps t o appreciate the nature o f the spoken w o r d t o contrast i t w i t h the w r i t t e n f o r m . A l t h o u g h phonetic w r i t i n g separates and extends the visual p o w e r o f words, i t is comparat i v e l y crude and slow.

B u t w r i t i n g tends t o be a k i n d o f separate or specialist action i n w h i c h there is little o p p o r t u n i t y or call f o r reaction. T h e literate man or society develops the tremendous p o w e r o f acting i n any matter w i t h considerable detachment f r o m the feelings or emotional involvement that a nonliterate man or society w o u l d experience. H e n r i Bergson, the French philosopher, lived and w r o t e i n a t r a d i t i o n o f t h o u g h t i n w h i c h i t was and is considered that language is a human technology that has impaired and diminished the values o f the collective unconscious. I t is the extension of man i n speech that enables the intellect t o detach itself f r o m the vastly w i d e r reality. W i t h o u t language, Bergson suggests, human i n telligence w o u l d have remained totally involved i n the objects o f its attention. Language does f o r intelligence w h a t the wheel does f o r the feet and the b o d y . I t enables t h e m t o move f r o m t h i n g t o t h i n g w i t h greater ease and speed and ever less involvement. Language extends and amplifies man b u t i t also divides his facul ties.

and m a n k i n d f r o m the cosmic unconscious. As an extension or u t t e r i n g ( o u t e r i n g ) o f all our senses at once, language has always been held t o be man's richest art f o r m , that w h i c h distinguishes h i m f r o m the animal creation. I f the human ear can be compared t o a radio receiver that is able to decode electromagnetic waves and recode them as sound, the human voice may be compared to the radio transmitter i n being able to translate sound i n t o electromagnetic waves. T h e power of the voice to shape air and space into verbal patterns may w e l l have been preceded b y a less specialized expression of cries, grunts, gestures, and commands, o f song and dance. T h e patterns of the senses that are extended i n the various languages o f men are as varied as styles o f dress and art. Each mother tongue teaches its users a w a y o f seeing and feeling the w o r l d , and of acting i n the w o r l d , that is quite unique. O u r new electric technology that extends our senses and nerves i n a global embrace has large implications f o r the f u t u r e of language. Electric technology does n o t need w o r d s any more than the digital computer needs numbers. E l e c t r i c i t y points the w a y to an extension of the process o f consciousness itself, on a w o r l d scale, and w i t h o u t any verbalization whatever. Such a state o f collective awareness may have been the preverbal conditio n o f men. Language as the technology o f human extension, whose powers o f division and separation w e k n o w so w e l l , m a y have been the " T o w e r of Babel" b y w h i c h men sought t o scale the highest heavens. T o d a y computers h o l d o u t the promise o f a means of instant translation of any code or language i n t o any other code or language.

The one crowded space i n Father Perry's house was his bookshelves. I gradually came to understand that the marks on the pages were trapped words. Anyone could learn to decipher the symbols and turn the trapped words loose again into speech. The ink of the print trapped the thoughts; they could no more get away than a doomboo could get out of a pit. W h e n the f u l l realization of what this meant flooded over me, I experienced the same thrill and amazement as when I had m y first glimpse of the bright lights of Konakry.

subject. I t is t r u e that there is more material w r i t t e n and printed and read today than ever before, b u t there is also a n e w electric technology that threatens this ancient technology of literacy b u i l t on the phonetic alphabet. Because o f its action i n extending our central nervous system, electric technology seems t o favor the inclusive and participational spoken w o r d over the specialist w r i t t e n w o r d . O u r Western values, b u i l t o n the w r i t t e n w o r d , have already been considerably affected b y the electric media of telephone, radio, and T V . Perhaps that is the reason w h y many h i g h l y literate people i n our time find i t difficult t o examine this question w i t h o u t getting into a m o r a l panic. T h e r e is the f u r t h e r circumstance that, d u r i n g his more than t w o thousand years of literacy, W e s t e r n man has done little to study or t o understand the effects o f the phonetic alphabet i n creating many o f his basic patterns of culture. T o begin n o w t o examine the question may, therefore, seem too late. Suppose that, instead o f displaying the Stars and Stripes, w e were t o w r i t e the w o r d s " A m e r i c a n flag" across a piece o f c l o t h and to display that. W h i l e the symbols w o u l d convey the same meaning, the effect w o u l d be quite different. T o translate the r i c h visual mosaic o f the Stars and Stripes into w r i t t e n f o r m w o u l d be t o deprive i t o f most o f its qualities o f corporate image and o f experience, y e t the abstract literal b o n d w o u l d remain m u c h the same. Perhaps this illustration w i l l serve t o suggest the change the tribal man experiences w h e n he becomes literate. N e a r l y all the emotional and corporate f a m i l y feeling is eliminated f r o m his relationship w i t h his social g r o u p . H e is emotionally free t o separate f r o m the tribe and t o become a civilized individual, a man of visual organization w h o has u n i f o r m attitudes, habits, and rights w i t h all other civilized individuals. T h e Greek m y t h about the alphabet was that Cadmus, reputedly the k i n g w h o introduced the phonetic letters i n t o Greece, sowed the dragon's teeth, and t h e y sprang u p armed men. L i k e any other m y t h , this one capsulates a prolonged process i n t o a flashing insight. T h e alphabet meant p o w e r and a u t h o r i t y and c o n t r o l o f m i l i t a r y structures at a distance. W h e n combined w i t h papyrus, the alphabet spelled the end o f the stationary temple bureauc-

racies and the priestly monopolies of knowledge and p o w e r . U n l i k e pre-alphabetic w r i t i n g , w h i c h w i t h its innumerable signs was difficult t o master, the alphabet c o u l d be learned i n a f e w hours. T h e acquisition o f so extensive a knowledge and so complex a skill as pre-alphabetic w r i t i n g represented, w h e n applied to such u n w i e l d y materials as b r i c k and stone, insured f o r the scribal caste a m o n o p o l y of priestly power. T h e easier alphabet and the l i g h t , cheap, transportable papyrus together effected the transfer o f p o w e r f r o m the priestly t o the m i l i t a r y class. A l l this is implied i n the m y t h about Cadmus and the dragon's teeth, including the fall o f the c i t y states, the rise o f empires and m i l i t a r y bureaucracies. I n terms o f the extensions o f man, the theme of the dragon's teeth i n the Cadmus m y t h is o f the utmost importance. Elias Canetti i n Crowds and Power reminds us that the teeth are an obvious agent of p o w e r i n man, and especially i n many animals. Languages are filled w i t h testimony t o the grasping, devouring p o w e r and precision o f teeth. T h a t the p o w e r o f letters as agents o f aggressive order and precision should be expressed as extensions o f the dragon's teeth is natural and f i t t i n g . T e e t h are emphatically visual i n their lineal order. Letters are n o t o n l y like teeth visually, b u t their power t o p u t teeth i n t o the business o f empire-building is manifest i n our W e s t e r n history. T h e phonetic alphabet is a unique technology. T h e r e have been m a n y kinds o f w r i t i n g , pictographic and syllabic, b u t there is o n l y one phonetic alphabet i n w h i c h semantically meaningless letters are used to correspond to semantically meaningless sounds. T h i s stark divison and parallelism between a visual and an a u d i t o ry w o r l d was b o t h crude and ruthless, c u l t u r a l l y speaking. T h e phonetically w r i t t e n w o r d sacrifices w o r l d s o f meaning and perception that were secured b y forms like the hieroglyph and the Chinese ideogram. These c u l t u r a l ly richer forms o f w r i t i n g , h o w ever, offered men no means of sudden transfer f r o m the magically discontinuous and traditional w o r l d o f the t r i b a l w o r d i n t o the cool and u n i f o r m visual medium. M a n y centuries o f ideogrammic use have n o t threatened the seamless w e b o f f a m i l y and t r i b a l subtleties o f Chinese society. O n the other hand, a single genera-

t i o n o f alphabetic literacy suffices i n A f r i c a today, as i n G a u l t w o thousand years ago, t o release the individual initially, at least, f r o m the tribal w e b . T h i s fact has n o t h i n g t o do w i t h the content of the alphabetized w o r d s ; i t is the result o f the sudden breach between the a u d i t o r y and the visual experience of man. O n l y the phonetic alphabet makes such a sharp division i n experience, giving to its user an eye f o r an ear, and freeing h i m f r o m the t r i b a l trance of resonating w o r d magic and the w e b o f kinship. I t can be argued, then, that the phonetic alphabet, alone, is the technology that has been the means o f creating " c i v i l i z e d man"--the separate individuals equal before a w r i t t e n code o f law. Separateness of the individual, c o n t i n u i t y of space and o f time, and u n i f o r m i t y o f codes are the prime marks of literate and civilized societies. T r i b a l cultures like those o f the I n d i a n and the Chinese may be greatly superior t o the Western cultures, i n the range and delicacy o f their perceptions and expression. H o w e v e r , w e are not here concerned w i t h the question of values, b u t w i t h the configurations of societies. T r i b a l cultures cannot entertain the possibility o f the individual or o f the separate citizen. T h e i r ideas o f spaces and times are neither continuous n o r u n i f o r m , b u t compassional and compressional i n their intensity. I t is i n its p o w e r t o extend patterns of visual u n i f o r m i t y and c o n t i n u i t y that the "message" of the alphabet is f e l t b y cultures. As an intensification and extension o f the visual f u n c t i o n , the phonetic alphabet diminishes the role o f the other senses o f sound and t o u c h and taste i n any literate culture. T h e fact that this does n o t happen i n cultures such as the Chinese, w h i c h use nonphonetic scripts, enables them t o retain a r i c h store o f inclusive perception i n depth of experience that tends t o become eroded i n civilized c u l tures of the phonetic alphabet. F o r the ideogram is an inclusive gestalt, n o t an analytic dissociation o f senses and functions like phonetic w r i t i n g . T h e achievements of the W e s t e r n w o r l d , i t is obvious, are test i m o n y to the tremendous values o f literacy. B u t m a n y people are also disposed t o object that w e have purchased our structure o f specialist technology and values at t o o h i g h a price. Certainly the

lineal structuring o f rational life b y phonetic literacy has involved us i n an interlocking set o f consistencies that are striking enough t o j u s t i f y a m u c h more extensive i n q u i r y than that o f the present chapter. Perhaps there are better approaches along quite d i f ferent lines; f o r example, consciousness is regarded as the mark o f a rational being, y e t there is n o t h i ng lineal or sequential about the total field of awareness that exists i n any moment of consciousness. Consciousness is n o t a verbal process. Yet d u r i n g all our centuries o f phonetic literacy w e have favored the chain of inference as the m a r k o f logic and reason. Chinese w r i t i n g , i n contrast, invests each ideogram w i t h a total i n t u i t i o n of being and reason that allows o n l y a small role to visual sequence as a m a r k o f mental effort and organization. I n W e s t e r n literate society i t is still plausible and acceptable to say that something " f o l l o w s " f r o m something, as i f there were some cause at w o r k that makes such a sequence. I t was D a v i d H u m e w h o , i n the eighteenth century, demonstrated that there is no causality indicated i n any sequence, natural or logical. T h e sequential is merely additive, n o t causative. Hume's argument, said Immanuel K a n t , "awoke me f r o m m y dogmatic slumber." Neither H u m e nor Kant, however, detected the hidden cause o f our Western bias t o w a r d sequence as " l o g i c " i n the a l l pervasive technology o f the alphabet. T o d a y i n the electric age w e feel as free to invent nonlineal logics as w e do to make n o n Euclidean geometries. Even the assembly line, as the method o f analytic sequence f o r mechanizing every k i n d of making and p r o d u c t i o n , is nowadays y i e l d i n g to new forms. O n l y alphabetic cultures have ever mastered connected lineal sequences as pervasive forms o f psychic and social organization. T h e breaking up o f every k i n d of experience i n t o u n i f o r m units i n order t o produce faster action and change of f o r m (applied knowledge) has been the secret o f Western p o w er over man and nature alike. T h a t is the reason w h y our W e s t e r n industrial programs have quite i n v o l u n t a r i l y been so militant, and o u r m i l i t a r y programs have been so industrial.

manifest even i n the Graeco-Roman phase, became more intense w i t h the u n i f o r m i t y and repeatability o f the Gutenberg development. Civilization is b u i l t on literacy because literacy is a u n i f o r m processing o f a culture b y a visual sense extended i n space and time b y the alphabet. I n tribal cultures, experience is arranged b y a dominant a u d i t o r y sense-life that represses visual values. T h e auditory sense, unlike the cool and neutral eye, is hyper-esthetic and delicate and all-inclusive. O r a l cultures act and react at the same time. Phonetic culture endows men w i t h the means of repressing their feelings and emotions w h e n engaged i n action. T o act w i t h o u t reacting, w i t h o u t involvement, is the peculiar advantage o f Western literate man. T h e story o f The Ugly American describes the endless succession o f blunders achieved b y visual and civilized Americans w h e n confronted w i t h the tribal and a u d i t o r y cultures of the East. A s a civilized U N E S C O experiment, r u n n i n g w a t e r -- w i t h its lineal organization of pipes--was installed recently i n some Indian v i l lages. Soon the villagers requested that the pipes be removed, f o r i t seemed t o them that the w h o l e social life o f the village had been impoverished w h e n i t was no longer necessary f o r all t o visit the communal w e l l . T o us the pipe is a convenience. W e do n o t t h i n k o f i t as culture or as a p r o d u c t o f literacy, any more than w e t h i n k of literacy as changing our habits, our emotions, or our perceptions. T o nonliterate people, i t is perfectly obvious that the most commonplace conveniences represent total changes i n culture. T h e Russians, less permeated w i t h the patterns o f literate c u l ture than Americans, have m u c h less difficult y i n perceiving and accommodating the Asiatic attitudes. For the W e s t , literacy has l o n g been pipes and taps and streets and assembly lines and inventories. Perhaps most potent o f all as an expression o f literacy is our system of u n i f o r m p r i c i n g that penetrates distant markets and speeds the turn-ove r o f commodities. Even our ideas of cause and effect i n the literate W e s t have l o n g been i n the f o r m o f things i n sequence and succession, an idea that strikes any tribal or audit o r y culture as quite ridiculous, and one that has lost its prime place i n our o w n n e w physics and b i o l o g y .

What  Should  We  Call  Reading?   Mara  Mills  /  New  York  University

Optacon  text-to-tactile  converter,  c.  1964 I.  Digital  Decoding  and  Literacy A  reading  environment  of  iPhone-books,  text-to-speech,  information  retrieval,  screened verbovisuals,  prompt  texts  and  textlinks  demands  its  own  theories  of  decoding  and  meaning- making.  In  I  Read  Where  I  Am,  a  compilation  of  "notes"  by  82  artists,  designers,  and  authors  on human  attention  and  intake  in  the  "new  information  culture,"  Anne  Mangen  (National  Centre  for Reading  Research  in  Norway)  defines  digital  reading  as  potentially  multimodal,  multimedial,  and multisensory:

Reading  has  diffused  to  a  virtually  limitless  variety  of  processes  and  practices  with  an  equally  endless variety  of  texts.  How  and  to  what  extent  are  existing  theories  and  models  of  reading  able  to  explain what's  going  on  when  we  read  the  kinds  of  dynamic,  interactive,  ephemeral  texts  that  appear  and disappear  in  an  instant,  as  in  instant  messaging  and  Twitter  ...  Another  challenge,  hitherto  unforeseen and  hence  largely  neglected,  is  the  role  of  the  reading  device  itself  ...  Reading  should  perhaps  be reconceptualized  as  a  multisensory  engagement  with  a  display  of  static  and  dynamic  configurations, implemented  in  a  device  with  particular  sensorimotor,  ergonomic,  affordances  which  in  different  ways interact  with  perceptual  cognitive  processes  at  play.1

Configuring  the  Reader,  from  Marshall  McLuhan's  The  Medium  is  the  Massage  to  the iPhone Reading  has  always  been  a  roomy  word,  although  even  in  Old  English  its  definition  was  split between  "decoding"  and  "interpretation."  Recent  digital  technologies  provide  new  metaphors  and means  for  theories  of  reading;  neuroscientists  have  taken  over  the  investigation  of  decoding,  while literary  and  media  scholars  rethink  interpretation.  In  the  discourse  of  neuroscience,  the  activity  of reading  is  miniaturized  to  a  "chain  of  processing  stages"  that  occur  between  the  retina  and  the  rest of  the  brain.  As  Stanislaus  Dehaene  explains  in  his  definitive  Reading  in  the  Brain,  the  goal  of research  into  the  neural  basis  of  reading  over  the  past  three  decades  has  been  "to  crack  the `algorithm'  of  visual  word  recognition--the  series  of  processing  steps  that  a  proficient  reader applies  to  the  problem  of  identifying  written  words."2  The  focus  has  thus  been  on  print  reading, refigured  as  a  variety  of  machine  reading. In  literary  and  media  studies,  many  theorists  have  analyzed  the  "configuration"  of  human interpretative  practices  by  digital  media  and  machine  reading  protocols.  Others,  such  as  Katherine Hayles  and  Stephen  Ramsay,  argue  for  layered  reading,  with  human  interpretation  extended through  machinic  aggregation  or  filtering.3  In  either  case,  signal  and  interface  transformations  have encouraged  new  bodily  habits  and  forms  of  attention  related  to  reading:  scanning,  searching, linking,  liking,  clicking,  selecting,  cutting  and  pasting,  navigating,  sharing,  skimming,  looking, glancing,  accessing,  multitasking,  mining,  and  pattern-recognizing.  At  a  more  abstract  level,  these techniques  have  suggested  new  interpretive  modes:  distracted,  distant,  shallow,  surface,  social,

synthetic,  collaborative,  and  hyper-reading. Like  the  cognitive  approach  to  decoding,  there  can  be  something  functionalist  about  these  new theories  of  interpretation,  by  which  I  mean  that  human  behaviors  are  presented  as  functions  of media  affordances.  Apart  from  social  reading,  many  of  these  strategies  are  radically individualized,  foregrounding  a  user  and  a  personal  device.  In  "How  We  Read,"  Hayles recommends  an  expanded  definition  of  reading,  with  a  focus  on  proficient  interpretation  (i.e. literacy):

Literary  studies  teaches  literacies  across  a  range  of  media  forms,  including  print  and  digital,  and  focuses on  interpretation  and  analysis  of  patterns,  meaning,  and  context  through  close,  hyper,  and  machine reading  practices.  Reading  has  always  been  constituted  through  complex  and  diverse  practices.  Now  it  is time  to  rethink  what  reading  is  and  how  it  works  in  the  rich  mixtures  of  words  and  images,  sounds  and animations,  graphics  and  letters  that  constitute  the  environments  of  twenty-first  century  literacies.4

Still  missing,  as  argued  by  Mangen,  is  a  semiotics  for  multimedia,  a  way  to  join  considerations  of perception  and  interpretation.  Also  neglected  by  many  of  the  literary  models  is  the  context  of  digital literacy  itself,  the  question  of  reading-for.  The  "we"  constituted  through  reading  or  implied  by particular  devices  is  another  point  of  contention. II.  After  Inkprint Today's  crisis  in  the  definition  of  reading  was  presaged  in  the  last  century  by  a  similar  set  of debates  about  print  access  technologies  and  alternate  reading  formats  for  blind  and  print  disabled people.  As  a  result  of  the  medium's  growing  ubiquity  and  ties  to  the  requirements  of  citizenship, exclusion  from  print  began  to  be  seen  as  disabling  in  and  of  itself.  The  notion  of  "print  handicaps" became  common  in  the  library  field  after  1966,  when  Public  Law  89-522  extended  the  Library  of Congress  Books  for  the  Blind  program  to  those  with  any  impairment  or  cognitive  difference  who were  "unable  to  read  normal  printed  material."  Unlike  dyslexia,  medically  defined  as  an  impairment of  the  brain,  the  category  of  "print  disability"  focuses  attention  on  the  built  environment  (i.e.  media) rather  than  physiology. According  to  the  neurotechnological  paradigm,  if  the  goal  is  fast  and  efficient  reading,  print  may  be essentially   impairing.  Dehaene  writes,  "Eye  movements  are  the  rate-limiting  step  in  reading.  If  a  full sentence  is  presented,  word  by  word,  at  the  precise  point  where  the  gaze  is  focalized,  thus avoiding  the  need  for  eye  movements,  a  good  reader  can  read  at  staggering  speed--a  mean  of eleven  hundred  words  per  minute."5  He  suggests  a  screening  technique  known  as  Rapid  Serial Visual  Presentation  (RSVP)  to  inhibit  the  eye's  movements,  or  saccades,  and  he  conjectures  that "perhaps  this  computerized  presentation  mode  represents  the  future  of  reading  in  a  world  where screens  progressively  replace  paper.  At  any  rate,  as  long  as  text  is  presented  in  pages  and  lines, acquisition  through  gaze  will  slow  reading  and  impose  an  unavoidable  limitation."6 The  modern  literacy  imperative  in  the  United  States  prompted  the  development  of  dozens  of  new formats--aural,  tactile,  olfactory,  visual--  by  which  blind  and  other  print  disabled  people  could read.  "Inkprint  reading"  became  one  among  many  possibilities,  starting  with  raised  print  and  Braille in  the  nineteenth  century  and  joined  in  the  twentieth  by  phonographic  Talking  Books,  Radio Reading  services,  and  a  variety  of  electronic  scanning  devices  for  translating  print  into  tones, Braille,  vibrations,  or  speech.  (One  such  scanning  device  is  the  Optacon,  featured  at  the  opening of  this  post.)  Talking  Books  and  Radio  Reading  are  only  available  to  readers  with  a  medical certification  of  disability,  hence  I've  classified  them  as  "prescription  media."  Formats  like  Braille were  historically  critiqued  by  sighted  people  for  accentuating  the  differences  between  themselves

and  the  blind--or  for  being  "separatist"  media.  For  many  blind  readers,  on  the  other  hand,  Talking Books  seem  to  embody  a  philosophy  of  normalization. In  some  cases,  these  new  formats  were  marketed  to  multiple  audiences--an  example  of  what Graham  Pullin  calls  "resonant  design"--connecting  otherwise  distinct  groups  through  shared technical  needs  or  enthusiasms.7  Libraries  began  loaning  microfilm-based  "ceiling  book  projectors" to  so-called  "bedfast"  individuals  in  the  1940s.  By  the  next  decade,  the  high-tech  family  was  also recruited  into  the  imagined  readership  of  projected  books.  Through  accidental  design convergences,  artifacts  with  similar  interfaces  or  outputs  might  also  provoke  resonances  between seemingly  dissimilar  user  groups;  in  a  recent  letter  to  the  New  York  Times,  disability  theorist Rosemarie  Garland-Thomson  proposes  that  Autocorrect  has  destigmatized  the  idiosyncratic diction  generated  by  speech  recognition  software.

"Ceiling  Book  Projector  for  Bed-ridden  Patrons"  of  the  East  Baton  Rouge  Parish  Library (c.1940s)

"Electronic  Home  Library,"  Book  Projector  Accompanied  by  Electronic  Voice  (1959) Reading  is  an  event  that  occurs  between  bodies,  devices,  symbols,  and  environments--if  any  of these  vary,  reading  changes.  Confronted  with  so  many  new  reading  formats,  librarians,  educators, and  psychologists  throughout  the  twentieth  century  began  to  revisit  the  old  decoding-interpretation definition  of  reading  (which  in  the  U.S.  had  generally  been  elaborated  to  three  stages:  phonics  or text-to-sound  decoding,  word  comprehension,  and  interpretation).  Was  listening  to  audiobooks,  for instance,  reading  or  just  an  "aid  to  reading"?  What  of  print  decoded  by  Deaf  readers,  for  whom phonics  was  irrelevant?  Could  Braille  and  tonal  codes  be  considered  "writing"?  If  speech  itself  was an  encoded  signal,  how  did  it  differ  from  writing? These  queries  continue.  In  2006,  the  National  Accessible  Reading  Assessment  Projects  offered three  definitions  of  reading,  which  successively  decenter  "writing"  and  "decoding"--but  not  "text":8

Definition  A Reading  is  decoding  and  understanding  written  text.  Decoding  requires  translating  the  symbols  of  writing systems  (including  braille)  into  the  spoken  words  they  represent.  Understanding  is  determined  by  the purposes  for  reading,  the  context,  the  nature  of  the  text,  and  the  readers'  strategies  and  knowledge. Definition  B Reading  is  decoding  and  understanding  text  for  particular  reader  purposes.  Readers  decode  written  text by  translating  text  to  speech,  and  translating  directly  to  meaning.  To  understand  written  text,  readers engage  in  constructive  processes  to  make  text  meaningful,  which  is  the  end  goal  or  product. Definition  C Reading  is  the  process  of  deriving  meaning  from  text.  For  the  majority  of  readers,  this  process  involves decoding  written  text.  Some  individuals  require  adaptations  such  as  braille  or  auditorization  to  support  the decoding  process.  Understanding  text  is  determined  by  the  purposes  for  reading,  the  context,  the  nature of  the  text,  and  the  readers'  strategies  and  knowledge.

As  reading  becomes  multimodal,  it  cannot  be  defined  as  a  bodily  function;  it  is  rather  a  "sphere  of activity"  like  play.  Theories  of  digital  reading  must  similarly  grapple  with  the  multiple  formats  for written  text,  the  relationship  of  words  to  other  signs,  and  the  routes  (whether  neural  or  strategic)  by which  decoding  occurs.  As  these  theories  evolve--following  Garland-Thomson's  logic--perhaps "accessible  reading"  will  no  longer  be  set  apart  from  reading  per  se. III.  On  the  Same  Page As  a  human  invention,  reading  is  necessarily  social  and  political.  In  the  schooling  context,  this goes  without  saying;  accessible  reading--like  all  reading--has  long  been  tied  to  "discipline." Literacy  instruction  poses  "good  reading"  as  purposeful  and  relatively  coherent,  an  access-to

something  else  (e.g.  employment  or  the  "common  culture"  of  a  nation).  As  a  mode  of  relation  to objects  and  to  other  people,  reading  is  not  just  benignly  "communicative":  it  can  be  exclusive, extractive,  and  enrolling;  it  can  be  unsettling  or  emulsifying.  Although  distinctions  between  print  and electronic  "cultures"  are  endemic  to  media  studies  (as  in  the  claim  that  digital,  networked technologies  encourage  remixing,  multitasking,  and  interactivity)  theories  of  digital  reading  have  yet to  adequately  connect  new  readerly  behaviors  and  modes  of  attention  to  questions  of  discipline and  political  economy. Studying  "mediated  congregation"  in  Protestant  mega-churches,  my  colleague  Erica  Robles- Anderson  asks  of  the  screened--and  often  distributed--worship  experience,  "How  do  we  know we're  on  the  same  page?"  For  the  case  of  digital  reading,  we  might  ask,  "What  does  it  mean  to  be on  the  same  page?"  Are  "we"  created,  as  an  imagined  community,  through  shared  content  across platforms,  or  through  shared  gestures  and  devices?  This  question  can  also  be  posed  for  low-tech multimodal  reading  formats,  like  the  print/Braille/Scratch  `n  Sniff  book  pictured  below.  Designed with  heterogeneous  readers  in  mind,  this  device  quite  deliberately  reformats  reading--and  also reading-together.9

HO ME  J O URNAL  Books in the Age of the iPad

Translations: BEL OR U SSIAN , JAPAN ESE, PORTU GESE

-- Craig Mod, MAR CH 2 0 1 0

GOOD RIDDANCE. As the publishing industry wobbles and Kindle sales jump, book romanticists cry themselves to sleep. But really, what are we shedding tears over? We're losing the throwaway paperback. The airport paperback. The beachside paperback. We're losing the dregs of the publishing world: disposable books. The book printed without consideration of form or sustainability or longevity. The book produced to be consumed once and then tossed. The book you bin when you're moving and you need to clean out the closet. These are the first books to go. And I say it again, good riddance. Once we dump this weight we can prune our increasingly obsolete network of distribution. As physicality disappears, so too does the need to fly dead trees around the world. You already know the potential gains: edgier, riskier books in digital form, born from a lower barrier-to-entry

From 2003-2009 I spent six years trying to make beautiful printed books. Six years. Focused on printed books. In the 00s. And I loved it. I loved the process. The finality of the end product. I loved the sexy-as-hell tactility of those little ink and paper bricks. But I can tell you this: the excitement I feel about the iPad as a content creator, designer and publisher -- and the potential it brings -- must be acknowledged. Acknowledged bluntly and with perspective. With the iPad we finally have a platform for consuming rich-content in digital form. What does that mean? To understand just why the iPad is so exciting we need to think about how we got here. I want to look at where printed books stand in respect to digital publishing, why we historically haven't read long- form text on screens and how the iPad is wedging itself in the middle of everything. In doing so I think we can find the line in the sand to define when content should be printed or digitized. This is a conversation for books-makers, web-heads, content-creators, authors and designers. For people who

love beautifully made things. And for the storytellers who are willing to take risks and want to consider the most appropriate shape and media for their yarns.

FOR TOO LONG, the act of printing something in and of itself has been placed on too high a pedestal. The true value of an object lies in what it says, not its mere existence. And in the case of a book, that value is intrinsically connected with content. Let's divide content into two broad groups. Content without well-defined form (Formless Content (Fig. 1)) Content with well-defined form (Definite Content (Fig. 2)) Formless Content can be reflowed into different formats and not lose any intrinsic meaning. It's content divorced from layout. Most novels and works of non-fiction are Formless. When Danielle Steele sits at her computer, she doesn't think much about how the text will look printed. She thinks about the story as a waterfall of text, as something that can be poured into any container. (Actually, she probably just thinks awkward and sexy things, but awkward and sexy things without regard for final form.) Content with form -- Definite Content -- is almost totally the opposite of Formless Content. Most texts composed with images, charts, graphs or poetry fall under this umbrella. It may be reflowable, but depending on how it's reflowed, inherent meaning and quality of the text may shift.

You can sure as hell bet that author Mark Z. Danielewski is well aware of the final form of his next novel. His content is so Definite it's actually impossible to digitize and retain all of the original meaning. Only Revolutions, a book loathed by many, forces readers to flip between the stories of two characters. The start of each printed at opposite ends of the book. A designer may, of course, working in concert with the author, imbue Formless Content with additional meaning in layout. The final combination of design and text becoming Definite Content.(See specimen: Vas) For an extreme and ubiquitous contemporary example of Definite Content, see Tufte. Love him or hate him, you have to admit he's a rare combination of author and designer, completely obsessed with final form, meaning and perfection in layout.(Fig. 3)

In the context of the book as an object, the key difference between Formless and Definite Content is the interaction between the content and the page. Formless Content doesn't see the page or its boundaries. Whereas Definite Content is not only aware of the page, but embraces it. It edits, shifts and resizes itself to fit the page. In a sense, Definite Content approaches the page as a canvas -- something with dimensions and limitations -- and leverages these attributes to both elevate the object and the content to a more complete whole. Put very simply, Formless Content is unaware of the container. Definite Content embraces the container as a canvas. Formless content is usually only text. Definite content usually has some visual elements along with text.

Much of what we consume happens to be Formless. The bulk of printed matter -- novels and non-fiction -- is Formless. In the last two years, devices excelling at displaying Formless Content have multiplied -- the Amazon Kindle being most obvious. Less obvious are devices like the iPhone, whose extremely high resolution screen, despite being small, makes longer texts much more comfortable to read than traditional digital displays. In other words, it's now easier and more comfortable than ever to consume Formless Content in a digital format. Is it as comfortable as reading a printed book? Maybe not. But we're getting closer. When people lament the loss of the printed book, this -- comfort -- is usually what they're talking about. My eyes tire more easily, they say. The batteries run out, the screen is tough to read in sunlight. It doesn't like bath tubs. Important to note is that these aren't complaints about the text losing meaning. Books don't become harder to understand, or confusing just because they're digital. It's mainly issues concerning quality. One inevitable property of the quality argument is that technology is closing the gap (through advancements in screens and batteries) and because of additional features (note taking, bookmarking, searching), will inevitably surpass the comfort level of reading on paper. The convenience of digital text -- on demand, lightweight (in file size and physicality), searchable -- already far trumps that of traditional printed matter. The formula used to be simple: stop printing Formless Content; only print well-considered Definite Content. The iPad changes this.

IT'S NO WONDER WE LOVE OUR PRINTED BOOKS -- we physically cradle them close to our heart. Unlike computer screens, the experience of reading on a Kindle or iPhone (or iPad, one can assume) mimics this familiar maternal embrace. The text is closer to us, the orientation more comfortable. And the seemingly insignificant fact that we touch the text actually plays a very key role in furthering the intimacy of the experience. The Kindle and iPhone are both lovely -- but they only do text. The iPad changes the experience formula.(Fig. 5) It brings the excellent text readability of the iPhone/Kindle to a larger canvas. It combines the intimacy and comfort of reading on those devices with a canvas both large enough and versatile enough to allow for well considered layouts.

What does this mean? Well, most obviously that a 1:1 digital adaptation of Definite Content(Fig. 6) books will now be possible. However, I don't think this is a solution we should blindly embrace. Definite Content in printed books is laid out specifically for that canvas, that page size. While the iPad may be similar in physical scope to those books, duplicating layouts would be a disservice to the new canvas and modes of interaction introduced by the iPad. Take something as fundamental as pages, for example. The metaphor of flipping pages already feels boring and forced on the iPhone. I suspect it will feel even more so on the iPad. The flow of content no longer has to be chunked into `page' sized bites. One simplistic reimagining of book layout would be to place chapters on the horizontal plane with content on a fluid vertical plane.(Fig. 7)

In printed books, the two-page spread was our canvas. It's easy to think similarly about the iPad. Let's not. The canvas of the iPad must be considered in a way that acknowledge the physical boundaries of the device, while also embracing the effective limitlessness of space just beyond those edges. We're going to see new forms of storytelling emerge from this canvas. This is an opportunity to redefine modes of conversation between reader and content. And that's one hell of an opportunity if making content is your thing.

SO: ARE PRINTED BOOKS DEAD? Not quite. The rules for iPad content are still ambiguous. None of us has had enough time with the device to confidently define them. I have, however, spent six years thinking about materials, form, physicality and content and -- to the best of my humble abilities -- producing printed books. So, for now, here's my take on the print side of things moving forward. Ask yourself, "Is your work disposable?" For me, in asking myself this, I only see one obvious ruleset: Formless Content goes digital. Definite Content gets divided between the iPad and printing. Of the books we do print -- the books we make -- they need rigor. They need to be books where the object is embraced as a canvas by designer, publisher and writer. This is the only way these books as physical objects will carry any meaning moving forward.

-- From 1871

NOT D I SPOSAB L E

- From 1871

I propose the following to be considered whenever we think of printing a book: The Books We Make embrace their physicality -- working in concert with the content to illuminate the narrative. The Books We Make are confident in form and usage of material. The Books We Make exploit the advantages of print. The Books We Make are built to last. (Fig. 9a, 9b) The result of this is: The Books We Make will feel whole and solid in the hands. The Books We Make will smell like now forgotten, far away libraries. The Books We Make will be something of which even our children -- who have fully embraced all things digital -- will understand the worth. The Books We Make will always remind people that the printed book can be a sculpture for thoughts and ideas. Anything less than this will be stepped over and promptly forgotten in the digital march forward. Goodbye disposable books. Hello new canvases.

This is a small collection of images of books from my library that I feel embody the above ethos. They're books that embrace their physicality or have stood the test of time. They're the kinds of books the iPad can't displace because they're complete objects. Some utilize painstaking hand printing atop exquisite paper (Heian). Some smell (also, Heian). Others are 100+ years old but still hanging on (Overland Through Asia). Others are very new but are either beautiful collaborations between writer and designer (Vas) or artistic objects in and of themselves (A Dictionary Story). Whatever they may be, they are not going to be thrown away anytime soon.

I would be careful about throwing the kindle around the room. Without protection the e-ink screen is actually really delicate. You have to remember that the modern phone is about 11th generation - so they include a degree of protection that allows you to throws yours across the room. Kindles and ereaders are still very new - technologywise.

I work in mixed media as well and love repurposing books. There are those that are sacred that I will scan vs pulling them apart, but I have a few that I keep for cannibalizing. Once you get past that "I'm so going to hell" feeling of ripping a page out it isn't so bad.

I solved that problem by not buying magazines. I like books, though. I have thousands of them. I also have an iPad. So far, I've only read one book on it, and that's because it was out of print as a real book and I couldn't find a copy anywhere. On a more serious note, the author of the article suggests making (real) books more substantial, such that they're built to last and are to some extent "special" items: this is a laudable idea, but would have the downside of making the books (a) more expensive, and (b) assume the characteristics of a "special" item -- one which you wouldn't really go and buy every day... this latter thing is a problem, because it would have the unintended side-effect of marginalizing printed books even more. I think that, unfortunately, the printed word will be gone in another 20 years... and those of us of a certain age (mine) will lament their passing and think to themselves that civilization is finished, and that the last vestiges of a certain type of intellectualism have left the

passing and think to themselves that civilization is finished, and that the last vestiges of a certain type of intellectualism have left the planet forever. But if we step back and examine this a little, in greater context, we can well imagine exactly the same types of things being said and thought by monks in the middle ages, once the printing press was created: no longer were books relegated to being single-instance, illuminated works of art - suddenly, any given book could be made available in volume, and to as many people as wanted a copy. I feel sure that the proponents of the illuminated, hand-written book felt that civilization was coming to an end, and that the printed word had just been cheapened beyond recognition... but in reality, what had happened was that the dissemination of knowledge had just been made incalculably more efficient: far from representing the end of civilization, the printed word represented the end of universal ignorance, and actually lifted civilization rather than depressing it. The same thing is happening here: by virtue of the electronic book, information not previously available in many parts of the world is now available there; one can hold and read many, many more books than, in a real-world, printed environment, one would ever be able to keep; one can share, create, annotate and, most importantly, search material in ways that have never previously been thinkable, let alone possible. But I'll miss paper books - just for myself - that's for sure.

What drugs are you taking that you can't see reality?? The amount of resources it takes to make an Ipad blows away what it take to make a book or even a thousand books and most likely even a 100,000 books. Then there is the whole economic barrier to buying it. Do I pay $500+electricity+new battery after 5 years+damage over time or do I pay 50 cents for a book or $3 for a magazine that I can give away to someone else with real loss to me. This is just another pipe dream of technology saving us that does nothing but dig the hole deeper for the world. I suggest you read Moby Dick to get a good idea of where we are heading as a culture.

There's a famous story that is told about Edison. On the day that he first lit up a park (in NY I think) with his new electric light, a reporter came up to him and asked him, "Do you think that someday ordinary people will be able to afford electric lights?" He is reported to have replied, "One day, only the rich will be able to afford candles." We've already seen the exponentially-improving electronic world displacing the physical in many areas, including music and games. Virtual goods use so little resources that they can become much less expensive than real ones. One day, only the rich will be able to afford paper books.

Well, this is all fine and dandy apart from three things. One version of this quote runs "When I am through, electricity will be so cheap that only the rich will be able to afford candles." Hmmm. Remember when nuclear power promised "Electricity too cheap to meter"? Secondly, candles are not so expensive that only the rich can afford them. Finally, the world's poorest people STILL don't have a cheap, reliable electricity supply. "Virtual goods use so little resources that they can become much less expensive than real ones." This is "free is the new cheap" argument, but it's essentially hollow. Virtual goods and utilities may not cost us anything but they DO use up energy, and waste the earth's resources. Google, for example. According to one report, the energy used by two Google searches is enough to boil a kettle.

I think you may a good point about there coming a time when only the rich will be able to afford paper books. Technology and books have different pricing structures. The longer a technology is out, the cheaper and better it gets. The fewer books that are created in a print run the more costly the books will be. As technology drops in price more consumers will decide to purchase it. Also as new features are added to the basic models, even more people will purchase the devices. This will lead to a decrease in the demand for paper books and cause smaller print runs. Smaller print runs will in turn drive the costs of a book up. Since the main purpose of any company is to turn a profit, this may see the companies focus more of their attention to the most profitable form.

Actually, I would change book to library. Edison was wrong, candles are still cheap, they just don't do the job as well as electric lights. I think it will be a very long time before paper books are so expensive that even an average joe cannot own one. The question is, will everyone want to? I think the answer is no. My son who is 12 may see the day when a paper book is a rarity, but I will not be too surprised if his son never buys a paper book.

"The amount of resources it takes to make an Ipad blows away what it take to make a book or even a thousand books and most likely even a 100,000 books." The amount of resources it takes to make an iPad is about the amount of resources it takes to make 20 hardcover books: $600/$30=20. The amount of resources it takes to make some of the upcoming ebook readers is about 3 hardcover books: $90/$30=3. "Do I pay $500+electricity+new battery after 5 years+damage over time" The price of ebook readers will probably come down to the price of a single hardcover book over the next 10 years. All of those will be able to wirelessly access (and probably even store) all the books you have ever bought. And as someone who owns about 5000 books and has had the displeasure of moving with them many times, I say: good riddance to printed books.

Ancient alchemists were concerned with converting lead to gold. In their quest to do this, they eventually found out how to do much more valuable things. By the 1950s, it was possible to convert lead to gold, but it cost more to convert the lead to gold than the gold was worth. But think of all the other more valuable things chemistry and science have done for us! If the iPad were a device that only read books, then yes, you may be right.

The interesting thing when any new device comes out is the new uses that appear later. First, the device is only used to do things we were already doing elsewhere. Then the things we were doing get better as software makers take fuller advantage of the device's capabilities. Then, entirely new things to do emerge. If authors begin thinking of themselves as software engineers, they'll see entirely new ways to use the device and others like it for storytelling. Interactive novels, novels with bits of video and sound embedded like a web page, a movie that plays in the top of the screen with notes below to read. I mean think of it, a major limitation that movies have in their storytelling is that they are less intimate than a novel. You can't fully get in the character's head. It might be possible to have a hybrid form emerge on these devices. Plus these devices are going to get cheaper and more affordable for everybody.

Used books are pretty cheap and you can find some great stuff. Not 50 cents but about $3 and then guess what, you can lend it to someone else when you're done with it. Not to mention the fact that I can take a book with me and if it gets stolen or lost, well no big loss, I'll be out a few bucks. But if my eReader gets stolen, I'm screwed.

I scour the local Dollar Tree occasionally and have found some fabulous books for a dollar. I recently spent 25 on a writing book at Barnes; great book, "The Mind of Your Story", currently on loan to a friend. A week later I found four copies of it at Dollar Tree and snagged them all, gave them as gifts to some of my writers group members. Used bookstores have some fabulous finds too. Completely agree Jon. I can replace a book, but not the tech to read one.

Of course "incredibly cheaply" will happen with e-books -- it already has!

All of them are free. Many of them include the original illustrations. And in reply to Chris Brainerd's comment, I would point out that Moby Dick is one of these books. I've read it myself, but I can't recommend it. However, since getting my Kindle I have become a big fan of Charles Dickens!

Sorry, had to laugh. $3.00 for a magazine? I wish. The cheapest one I read is around $6.00, but the majority of the magazines I buy are $12 - 17.00 and I don't buy them very often. I love tech as much as I love analog, iPads and eBooks have their place. I don't see printed books falling off planet yet. Pleasure reading I would get a Nook/Kindle as I enjoy the ability to carry more books than I could lug around in a backpack; that kind of mobility for my reference material would be fabulous. I am working on my Masters currently though and, as a student, much prefer a printed book in my hand; that is my kind of "interactive".

What is ten times $53? Answer: about the cost of an iPad.

I hear what you're saying. That said, I wouldn't let these developments trouble you. Paper books and the conveniences they offer are not going away anytime soon, not until other alternatives meet the very same requirements we demand from pulp. However, consider this: eBooks and other portable electronic reading devices, *used largely as reading devices for pleasure and/or pure discovery* are still in the very early adopter phase, when considering their overall penetration in the worldwide market for those specific uses. In the future, reading portability will be embedded in one's eyeglasses (unless we evolve to a place where genetic selection eliminates nearsightedness and other minor visual abnormalities); on nanopainted, electronically charged walls; on the very windows of our homes and autos, etc. etc. - all this and more is on its way. t's very difficult to point to when these developments will happen, but they *will* happen. And, they *will* become very, very inexpensive. eBooks will go the way of calculators in price. Reading devices will be given away for free, leveraged against content (where the real value is). I treasure the ability to just buy a book at my local used book outlet, for free - that pleasure will be with us for a long, long time. Paper books will not be obsolete for a long, long time. In fact, I see a day when network enabled ePaper is just as cheap as pulp-based paper, with the idea that you only have to buy a notebook with a few pages of the stuff to download things endlessly. New forms of presentation media will also create a slow evolution of how our species *wants* to present things. I wouldn't fret about this. Rather, consider it all as a parade of development that one can watch as it happens, and in fact read about in a pulp-paper-based book - as many of us do, today, until the economies and efficiencies and human "touch" of these technologies become so compelling that most would never think of using them again. There will always be paper books, in some form or other. Just like the quill pen, paper books will contain a satisfaction for some. That's OK, The days of paper books are numbered, but that number of days will be measured over many decades. Just as the quill pen slipped out of use, so will the paper book. By the time we get to that event horizon, electronic reading will seem so second nature, so cheap, to easy to access, or full of creative possibilities (for those that want to exercise them) that paper as we know it will simply not be desired. I know that seems hard to believe, but buggy whips and quill pens were once thought of in the same way, so were stone tablets.

While you're definitely right to look beyond only the supposed savings in paper to the costs of the more complete system, hopefully you're much too pessimistic regarding the resource price of eBook readers. One doubts the manufacturing an eBook reader is quite so stupendously resource intensive, or toxic waste producing as you suggest. But as you implicitly bring out, insisting that the components be recyclable and not result in large amounts of toxic waste whose long term costs are externalized onto vulnerable outsiders may be a necessary direction to take.

Hm. Wood pulp is an awful way to provide information. It comes from decimated forests, it uses harsh bleaching chemicals and large hot factories. Once the books eventually are made, they need to be stored, transported in huge trucks and when not sold, pulped again and sent to the bleaching tubs. Most of the money in the book industry goes to run the factories and put gas in the trucks and pay the drivers and factory workers. I will not lament the loss of the 50c novel because I don't buy 50c novels. I only buy hardbacks which I intend to keep, and I think this is what Craig is getting at. The crappy low end of the market is vanishing. We will enjoy the feeling of better quality media for our content at the same time as having better access to globalised content. And there's a certain myopia among the book obsessed. iPad is not a eBook reader like the Kindle. All of the arguments you give are very easily applied to the Kindle and the Sony eReaders because of their limited utility. iPad is aimed as a 'content' consumption device, a device which could potentially replace a full PC in many households, a device which will challenge the laptop for certain knowledge workers (including this one), a travelling entertainment device, something to amuse the kids on long journeys, a digital picture frame, a portable email client, a web browser sans compare.

Wood pulp may be awful from certain perspectives, but when it comes to archival qualities, it surpasses digital by an order of magnitude. As example, find digital information from 1985 and the cheapest paperback printed at the same time. The digital info will require a hard to find obsolete method of reading it, assuming it hasn't succumbed to bit-rot. The paperback will be yellowed but easily readable. One twice its age will likely be the same. This all isn't just speculation, there was a recent problem with NASA having difficulty accessing old probe information because they couldn't find a machine to read it on. Essentially, digital media turns our literature into an electronic equivalent of of an oral culture, with superior error checking. Mind, I'm not saying to be a Luddite about this, or think that pulp books are like clay tablets in terms of durability, but rather that eBooks are not some panacea, and if any creator wants any decent chance for their work to be around for history to care about, they should take some steps at getting something more archival produced. The crappy low end of the market is an important part of our culture, IMO, and I'd like for future civilizations to at least see some of it, instead of recording a mass extinction of that type of information in the early 2000's.

Re: Finding digital content from 1985. That all depends on how the content was stored. Did it get saved in an opaque format only readable by it's creator? As you say, it'll be hard to get back Did it get saved as an open format, such as plain text, jpg or bmp? Then you're golden. Here's an article I dug on from 1985 from an old BBS.

Quite true regarding open standards; I should of been more clear. The example text given survived via transfer to the internet at some point. As long as the internet is around, and that text keeps getting saved by various people on various servers, we are good. But I was thinking more in terms of say, .txt files saved on 5 1/4 floppies that weren't transitioned. They are in your basement or something. Unless you kept your old gear and it still works, you'll need to go find a 5 1/4 drive, pray you aren't stuck using a mac and have to buy some USB workaround or something, (Full disclosure: This is typed on a mac) hope your PC mobo still has a floppy port, and that the disc is still readable. And that you are a geek who can do all of that, instead of your average computer user. That's the kind of archival problem I'm worried about.

I think you may be mistaken here. Even the lowly smartphone has already replaced laptops for many people. Tablets will replace many more. We forget that a large percentage of laptop users purchased their machines because at the time it was the only real portable option to do what they do on a computer. Most users do not need or require the power of a full blown PC. They email, surf, socialize, read, consult maps...find a good restaurant, etc. I think the iPad will be transformational as a reader, not necessarily because it is the the best reader, but because it will be a powerful device in so many arenas....and therefore sell in the millions. Market dominance by definition means that content producers will flock to take advantage of the platform....by producing content that separates them from the rest. We are in for a great ride.

An iPad is primarily a content consumer device with a limited content creation role, for such things as emails, a simple web page or photo formatting. Content creators will continue to use fully functional computers, as will niche consumers of highend content such as processor-intensive games. The thing to recognize is that the vast majority of computer owners today are content consumers. They neither need nor want a powerful system, but they had no choice. Those people will move quickly to embrace the tablet / ereader / smartphone platform.

Great, thoughtful article. Some random thoughts, in no particular order: That many books are "disposable" isn't necessarily a reflection on the quality of the physical product, but rather of the content itself. Ironic that you chose Danielle Steele as an example. I bet you have hundreds of albums that you've listened to over and over, and dozens of movies that you've seen several times. But the number of books people re-read is probably really small. I just did a quick survey of one of my bookshelves. Out of 89 books, there were 20 that I'd read more than once, and that was skewed high because it had a large number of children's books, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, that I read obsessively as a kid. Anyway, the point is that if a book is thrown in a box in the garage or left on the airplane or in a hotel, it's probably because the *content* was only meant to be consumed once. One problem I face in the switch to digital books is the loss of a signaling function. I like having my house full of bookshelves stuffed with books. I like seeing them and touching them. I like it when other people see them and touch them. Whenever I go to someone's house, once of the first things I do is wander over to the bookshelf to see what they read. Physical books provide a powerful social signal that I worry will wink out in the transition to digital. Admittedly, the transition of music to digital means this could just require a behavioral change. I love music as much as I love books, and for years kept my CDs displayed in racks. But the switch to digital meant they just took up a lot of space without contributing anything. Now, signalling about music tastes is done through direct conversation -- "Heard any good music lately?" -- and through browsing through someone else's iPod. I''m not too worried about losing my whole book library to some technological malfunction. The Kindle, at least, backs up your purchases in Amazon's cloud, so you can re-download any book you've bought at any time. And since an EMP powerful enough to fry Amazon's databases

Hi Scott, Thanks for the great comment. Responses below: > That many books are "disposable" isn't necessarily a reflection on the quality of the physical product, but rather of the content itself. Ironic that you chose Danielle Steele as an example. I bet you have hundreds of albums that you've listened to over and over, and dozens of movies that you've seen several times.

And I think being able to judge content appropriately -- is it single serving or not? -- is one of the cornerstones in choosing the right medium for it. > One problem I face in the switch to digital books is the loss of a signaling function.

I'm an architecture nut and one of the first things I look for in house design is how they did the bookshelves.

WRITING RESTRUCTURES CONSCIOUSNESS
THE NEW WORLD OF AUTONOMOUS DISCOURSE
A deeper understanding of pristine or primary orality enables us better to understand the new world of writing, what it truly is, and what functionally literate human beings really are: beings whose thought processes do not grow out of simply natural powers but out of these powers as structured, directly or indirectly, by the technology of writing. Without writing, the literate mind would not and could not think as it does, not only when engaged in writing but normally even when it is composing its thoughts in oral form. More than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness. Writing establishes what has been called `context-free' language (Hirsch 1977, pp. 21­3, 26) or `autonomous' discourse (Olson 1980a), discourse which cannot be directly questioned or contested as oral speech can be because written discourse has been detached from its author. Oral cultures know a kind of autonomous discourse in fixed ritual formulas (Olson 1980a, pp. 187­94; Chafe 1982), as well as in vatic sayings or prophesies, for which the utterer himself or herself is considered only the channel, not the source. The Delphic oracle was not

78

orality and literacy

responsible for her oracular utterances, for they were held to be the voice of the god. Writing, and even more print, has some of this vatic quality. Like the oracle or the prophet, the book relays an utterance from a source, the one who really `said' or wrote the book. The author might be challenged if only he or she could be reached, but the author cannot be reached in any book. There is no way directly to refute a text. After absolutely total and devastating refutation, it says exactly the same thing as before. This is one reason why `the book says' is popularly tantamount to `it is true'. It is also one reason why books have been burnt. A text stating what the whole world knows is false will state falsehood forever, so long as the text exists. Texts are inherently contumacious.

PLATO, WRITING AND COMPUTERS
Most persons are surprised, and many distressed, to learn that essentially the same objections commonly urged today against computers were urged by Plato in the Phaedrus (274­7) and in the Seventh Letter against writing. Writing, Plato has Socrates say in the Phaedrus, is inhuman, pretending to establish outside the mind what in reality can be only in the mind. It is a thing, a manufactured product. The same of course is said of computers. Secondly, Plato's Socrates urges, writing destroys memory. Those who use writing will become forgetful, relying on an external resource for what they lack in internal resources. Writing weakens the mind. Today, parents and others fear that pocket calculators provide an external resource for what ought to be the internal resource of memorized multiplication tables. Calculators weaken the mind, relieve it of the work that keeps it strong. Thirdly, a written text is basically unresponsive. If you ask a person to explain his or her statement, you can get an explanation; if you ask a text, you get back nothing except the same, often stupid, words which called for your question in the first place. In the modern critique of the computer, the same objection is put, `Garbage in, garbage out'. Fourthly, in keeping with the agonistic mentality of oral cultures, Plato's Socrates also holds it against writing that the written word cannot defend itself as the natural spoken word can: real speech and thought always exist essentially in a context of give-and-take between real persons.

writing restructures consciousness

Writing is passive, out of it, in an unreal, unnatural world. So are computers. A fortiori, print is vulnerable to these same charges. Those who are disturbed by Plato's misgivings about writing will be even more disturbed to find that print created similar misgivings when it was first introduced. Hieronimo Squarciafico, who in fact promoted the printing of the Latin classics, also argued in 1477 that already `abundance of books makes men less studious' (quoted in Lowry 1979, pp. 29­31): it destroys memory and enfeebles the mind by relieving it of too much work (the pocket-computer complaint once more), downgrading the wise man and wise woman in favor of the pocket compendium. Of course, others saw print as a welcome leveler: everyone becomes a wise man or woman (Lowry 1979, pp. 31­2). One weakness in Plato's position was that, to make his objections effective, he put them into writing, just as one weakness in anti-print positions is that their proponents, to make their objections more effective, put the objections into print. The same weakness in anti-computer positions is that, to make them effective, their proponents articulate them in articles or books printed from tapes composed on computer terminals. Writing and print and the computer are all ways of technologizing the word. Once the word is technologized, there is no effective way to criticize what technology has done with it without the aid of the highest technology available. Moreover, the new technology is not merely used to convey the critique: in fact, it brought the critique into existence. Plato's philosophically analytic thought, as has been seen (Havelock 1963), including his critique of writing, was possible only because of the effects that writing was beginning to have on mental processes. In fact, as Havelock has beautifully shown (1963), Plato's entire epistemology was unwittingly a programmed rejection of the old oral, mobile, warm, personally interactive lifeworld of oral culture (represented by the poets, whom he would not allow in his Republic). The term idea, form, is visually based, coming from the same root as the Latin video, to see, and such English derivatives as vision, visible, or videotape. Platonic form was form conceived of by analogy with visible form. The Platonic ideas are voiceless, immobile, devoid of all warmth, not interactive but isolated, not part of the human lifeworld at all but

80

orality and literacy

utterly above and beyond it. Plato of course was not at all fully aware of the unconscious forces at work in his psyche to produce this reaction, or overreaction, of the literate person to lingering, retardant orality. Such considerations alert us to the paradoxes that beset the relationships between the original spoken word and all its technological transformations. The reason for the tantalizing involutions here is obviously that intelligence is relentlessly reflexive, so that even the external tools that it uses to implement its workings become `internalized', that is, part of its own reflexive process. One of the most startling paradoxes inherent in writing is its close association with death. This association is suggested in Plato's charge that writing is inhuman, thing-like, and that it destroys memory. It is also abundantly evident in countless references to writing (and/or print) traceable in printed dictionaries of quotations, from 2 Corinthians 3:6, `The letter kills but the spirit gives life' and Horace's reference to his three books of Odes as a `monument' (Odes iii.30. 1), presaging his own death, on to and beyond Henry Vaughan's assurance to Sir Thomas Bodley that in the Bodleian Library at Oxford `every book is thy epitaph'. In Pippa Passes, Robert Browning calls attention to the still widespread practice of pressing living flowers to death between the pages of printed books, `faded yellow blossoms/twixt page and page'. The dead flower, once alive, is the psychic equivalent of the verbal text. The paradox lies in the fact that the deadness of the text, its removal from the living human lifeworld, its rigid visual fixity, assures its endurance and its potential for being resurrected into limitless living contexts by a potentially infinite number of living readers (Ong 1977, pp. 230­71).

WRITING IS A TECHNOLOGY
Plato was thinking of writing as an external, alien technology, as many people today think of the computer. Because we have by today so deeply interiorized writing, made it so much a part of ourselves, as Plato's age had not yet made it fully a part of itself (Havelock 1963), we find it difficult to consider writing to be a technology as we commonly assume printing and the computer to be. Yet writing (and especially alphabetic writing) is a technology, calling for the use of tools and

writing restructures consciousness

81

other equipment: styli or brushes or pens, carefully prepared surfaces such as paper, animal skins, strips of wood, as well as inks or paints, and much more. Clanchy (1979, pp. 88­115) discusses the matter circumstantially, in its western medieval context, in his chapter entitled `The technology of writing'. Writing is in a way the most drastic of the three technologies. It initiated what print and computers only continue, the reduction of dynamic sound to quiescent space, the separation of the word from the living present, where alone spoken words can exist. By contrast with natural, oral speech, writing is completely artificial. There is no way to write `naturally'. Oral speech is fully natural to human beings in the sense that every human being in every culture who is not physiologically or psychologically impaired learns to talk. Talk implements conscious life but it wells up into consciousness out of unconscious depths, though of course with the conscious as well as unconscious co-operation of society. Grammar rules live in the unconscious in the sense that you can know how to use the rules and even how to set up new rules without being able to state what they are. Writing or script differs as such from speech in that it does not inevitably well up out of the unconscious. The process of putting spoken language into writing is governed by consciously contrived, articulable rules: for example, a certain pictogram will stand for a certain specific word, or a will represent a certain phoneme, b another, and so on. (This is not to deny that the writer­reader situation created by writing deeply affects unconscious processes involved in composing in writing, once one has learned the explicit, conscious rules. More about this later.) To say writing is artificial is not to condemn it but to praise it. Like other artificial creations and indeed more than any other, it is utterly invaluable and indeed essential for the realization of fuller, interior, human potentials. Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word. Such transformations can be uplifting. Writing heightens consciousness. Alienation from a natural milieu can be good for us and indeed is in many ways essential for full human life. To live and to understand fully, we need not only proximity but also distance. This writing provides for consciousness as nothing else does.

82

orality and literacy

Technologies are artificial, but ­ paradox again ­ artificiality is natural to human beings. Technology, properly interiorized, does not degrade human life but on the contrary enhances it. The modern orchestra, for example, is the result of high technology. A violin is an instrument, which is to say a tool. An organ is a huge machine, with sources of power ­ pumps, bellows, electric generators ­ totally outside its operator. Beethoven's score for his Fifth Symphony consists of very careful directions to highly trained technicians, specifying exactly how to use their tools. Legato: do not take your finger off one key until you have hit the next. Staccato: hit the key and take your finger off immediately. And so on. As musicologists well know, it is pointless to object to electronic compositions such as Morton Subotnik's The Wild Bull on the grounds that the sounds come out of a mechanical contrivance. What do you think the sounds of an organ come out of? Or the sounds of a violin or even of a whistle? The fact is that by using a mechanical contrivance, a violinist or an organist can express something poignantly human that cannot be expressed without the mechanical contrivance. To achieve such expression of course the violinist or organist has to have interiorized the technology, made the tool or machine a second nature, a psychological part of himself or herself. This calls for years of `practice', learning how to make the tool do what it can do. Such shaping of a tool to oneself, learning a technological skill, is hardly dehumanizing. The use of a technology can enrich the human psyche, enlarge the human spirit, intensify its interior life. Writing is an even more deeply interiorized technology than instrumental musical performance is. But to understand what it is, which means to understand it in relation to its past, to orality, the fact that it is a technology must be honestly faced.

WHAT IS `WRITING' OR `SCRIPT'?
Writing, in the strict sense of the word, the technology which has shaped and powered the intellectual activity of modern man, was a very late development in human history. Homo sapiens has been on earth perhaps some 50,000 years (Leakey and Lewin 1979, pp. 141 and 168). The first script, or true writing, that we know, was developed

writing restructures consciousness

83

among the Sumerians in Mesopotamia only around the year 3500 BC (Diringer 1953; Gelb 1963). Human beings had been drawing pictures for countless millennia before this. And various recording devices or aides-mémoire had been used by various societies: a notched stick, rows of pebbles, other tallying devices such as the quipu of the Incas (a stick with suspended cords onto which other cords were tied), the `winter count' calendars of the Native American Plains Indians, and so on. But a script is more than a mere memory aid. Even when it is pictographic, a script is more than pictures. Pictures represent objects. A picture of a man and a house and a tree of itself says nothing. (If a proper code or set of conventions is supplied, it might: but a code is not picturable, unless with the help of another unpicturable code. Codes ultimately have to be explained by something more than pictures; that is, either in words or in a total human context, humanly understood.) A script in the sense of true writing, as understood here, does not consist of mere pictures, of representations of things, but is a representation of an utterance, of words that someone says or is imagined to say. It is of course possible to count as `writing' any semiotic mark, that is, any visible or sensible mark which an individual makes and assigns a meaning to. Thus a simple scratch on a rock or a notch on a stick interpretable only by the one who makes it would be `writing'. If this is what is meant by writing, the antiquity of writing is perhaps comparable to the antiquity of speech. However, investigations of writing which take `writing' to mean any visible or sensible mark with an assigned meaning merge writing with purely biological behavior. When does a footprint or a deposit of feces or urine (used by many species of animals for communication ­ Wilson 1975, pp. 228­9) become `writing'? Using the term `writing' in this extended sense to include any semiotic marking trivializes its meaning. The critical and unique breakthrough into new worlds of knowledge was achieved within human consciousness not when simple semiotic marking was devised but when a coded system of visible marks was invented whereby a writer could determine the exact words that the reader would generate from the text. This is what we usually mean today by writing in its sharply focused sense. With writing or script in this full sense, encoded visible markings

84

orality and literacy

engage words fully so that the exquisitely intricate structures and references evolved in sound can be visibly recorded exactly in their specific complexity and, because visibly recorded, can implement production of still more exquisite structures and references, far surpassing the potentials of oral utterance. Writing, in this ordinary sense, was and is the most momentous of all human technological inventions. It is not a mere appendage to speech. Because it moves speech from the oral­ aural to a new sensory world, that of vision, it transforms speech and thought as well. Notches on sticks and other aides-mémoire lead up to writing, but they do not restructure the human lifeworld as true writing does. True writing systems can and usually do develop gradually from a cruder use of mere memory aides. Intermediate stages exist. In some coded systems the writer can predict only approximately what the reader will read off, as in the system developed by the Vai in Liberia (Scribner and Cole 1978) or even in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. The tightest control of all is achieved by the alphabet, although even this is never quite perfect in all instances. If I mark a document `read', this might be a past participle (pronounced to rhyme with `red') indicating that the document has been gone over, or it might be an imperative (pronounced to rhyme with `reed') indicating that it is to be gone over. Even with the alphabet, extra-textual context is sometimes needed, but only in exceptional cases ­ how exceptional will depend on how well the alphabet has been tailored to a given language.

MANY SCRIPTS BUT ONLY ONE ALPHABET
Many scripts across the world have been developed independently of one another (Diringer 1953; Diringer 1960; Gelb 1963): Mesopotamian cuneiform 3500 BC (approximate dates here from Diringer 1962), Egyptian hieroglyphics 3000 BC (with perhaps some influence from cuneiform), Minoan or Mycenean `Linear B' 1200 BC, Indus Valley script 3000­2400 BC, Chinese script 1500 BC, Mayan script AD 50, Aztec script AD 1400. Scripts have complex antecedents. Most if not all scripts trace back directly or indirectly to some sort of picture writing, or, sometimes perhaps, at an even more elemental level, to the use of tokens. It has

writing restructures consciousness

85

been suggested that the cuneiform script of the Sumerians, the first of all known scripts (c. 3500 BC), grew at least in part out of a system of recording economic transactions by using clay tokens encased in small, hollow but totally closed pod-like containers or bullae, with indentations on the outside representing the tokens inside (Schmandt-Besserat 1978). Thus the symbols on the outside of the bulla ­ say, seven indentations ­ carried with them, inside the bulla, evidence of what they represented ­ say, seven little clay artefacts distinctively shaped, to represent cows, or ewes or other things not yet decipherable ­ as though words were always proffered with their concrete significations attached. The economic setting of such prechirographic use of tokens could help associate them with writing, for the first cuneiform script, from the same region as the bullae, whatever its exact antecedents, served mostly workaday economic and administrative purposes in urban societies. Urbanization provided the incentive to develop record keeping. Using writing for imaginative creations, as spoken words have been used in tales or lyric, that is, using writing to produce literature in the more specific sense of this term, comes quite late in the history of script. Pictures can serve simply as aides-mémoire, or they can be equipped with a code enabling them to represent more or less exactly specific words in various grammatical relation to each other. Chinese character writing is still today basically made up of pictures, but pictures stylized and codified in intricate ways which make it certainly the most complex writing system the world has ever known. Pictographic communication such as found among early Native American Indians and many others (Mackay 1978, p. 32) did not develop into a true script because the code remained too unfixed. Pictographic representations of several objects served as a kind of allegorical memorandum for parties who were dealing with certain restricted subjects which helped determine in advance how these particular pictures related to each other. But often, even then, the meaning intended did not come entirely clear. Out of pictographs (a picture of a tree represents the word for a tree), scripts develop other kinds of symbols. One kind is the ideograph, in which the meaning is a concept not directly represented by the picture but established by code: for example, in the Chinese pictograph a stylized picture of two trees does not represent the words `two

86

orality and literacy

trees' but the word `woods'; stylized pictures of a woman and child side-by-side represent the word `good', and so on. The spoken word for woman is [ny], for child [dz], for good [hau]: the pictorial etymology, as here, need have no relationship to the phonemic etymology. Writers of Chinese relate to their language quite differently from Chinese speakers who cannot write. In a special sense, numerals such as 1, 2, 3 are interlinguistic ideographs (though not pictographs): they represent the same concept but not the same sound in languages which have entirely different words for 1, 2, 3. And even within the lexicon of a given language, the signs 1, 2, 3 and so on are in a way connected directly with the concept rather than the word: the words for 1 (`one') and 2 (`two') relate to the concepts `1st' and `2nd' but not to the words `first' and `second'. Another kind of pictograph is rebus writing (the picture of the sole of a foot could represent in English also the fish called a sole, sole in the sense of only, or soul as paired with body; pictures of a mill, a walk, and a key in that order could represent the word `Milwaukee'). Since at this point the symbol represents primarily a sound, a rebus is a kind of phonogram (sound-symbol), but only mediately: the sound is designated not by an abstract coded sign, as a letter of the alphabet, but by a picture of one of the several things the sound signifies. All pictographic systems, even with ideographs and rebuses, require a dismaying number of symbols. Chinese is the largest, most complex, and richest: the K'anghsi dictionary of Chinese in AD 1716 lists 40,545 characters. No Chinese or Sinologist knows them all, or ever did. Few Chinese who write can write all of the spoken Chinese words that they can understand. To become significantly learned in the Chinese writing system normally takes some twenty years. Such a script is basically time-consuming and élitist. There can be no doubt that the characters will be replaced by the roman alphabet as soon as all the people in the People's Republic of China master the same Chinese language (`dialect'), the Mandarin now being taught everywhere. The loss to literature will be enormous, but not so enormous as a Chinese typewriter using over 40,000 characters. One advantage of a basically pictographic system is that persons speaking different Chinese `dialects' (really different Chinese languages, mutually incomprehensible, though basically of the same

writing restructures consciousness

87

structure) who are unable to understand one another's speech can understand one another's writing. They read off different sounds for the same character (picture), somewhat as a Frenchman and a Luba and a Vietnamese and an Englishman will know what each other means by the Arabic numerals 1, 2, 3, and so on, but will not recognize the numeral if pronounced by one of the others. (However, the Chinese characters are basically pictures, though exquisitely stylized, as 1, 2, 3 are not.) Some languages are written in syllabaries, in which each sign represents a consonant and a following vowel sound. Thus the Japanese Katakana syllabary has five separate symbols respectively for ka, ke, ki, ko, ku, five others for ma, me, mi, mo, mu, and so on. The Japanese language happens to be so constituted that it can utilize a syllabary script: its words are made up of parts always consisting of a consonantal sound followed by a vowel sound (n functions as a quasisyllable), with no consonant clusters (as in `pitchfork', `equipment'). With its many different kinds of syllables, and its frequent consonant clusters, English could not be effectively managed in a syllabary. Some syllabaries are less developed than Japanese. In that of the Vai in Liberia, for example, there is not a full one-to-one correspondence between the visual symbols and the units of sound. The writing provides only a kind of map to the utterance it registers, and it is very difficult to read, even for a skilled scribe (Scribner and Cole 1978, p. 456). Many writing systems are in fact hybrid systems, mixing two or more principles. The Japanese system is hybrid (besides a syllabary, it uses Chinese characters, pronounced in its own non-Chinese way); the Korean system is hybrid (besides hangul, a true alphabet, perhaps the most efficient of all alphabets, it uses Chinese characters pronounced its own way); the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic system was hybrid (some symbols were pictographs, some ideographs, some rebuses); Chinese character writing itself is hybrid (mixed pictographs, ideographs, rebuses, and various combinations, often of extreme complexity, cultural richness and poetic beauty). Indeed, because of the tendency of scripts to start with pictographs and move to ideographs and rebuses, perhaps most writing systems other than the alphabet are to some degree hybrid. And even alphabetic writing becomes hybrid when it writes 1 instead of one.

orality and literacy

The most remarkable fact about the alphabet no doubt is that it was invented only once. It was worked up by a Semitic people or Semitic peoples around the year 1500 BC, in the same general geographic area where the first of all scripts appeared, the cuneiform, but two millennia later than the cuneiform. (Diringer 1962, pp. 121­2, discusses the two variants of the original alphabet, the North Semitic and the South Semitic.) Every alphabet in the world ­ Hebrew, Ugaritic, Greek, Roman, Cyrillic, Arabic, Tamil, Malayalam, Korean ­ derives in one way or another from the original Semitic development, though, as in Ugaritic and Korean script, the physical design of the letters may not always be related to the Semitic design. Hebrew and other Semitic languages, such as Arabic, do not to this day have letters for vowels. A Hebrew newspaper or book still today prints only consonants (and so-called semi­vowels [j] and [w], which are in effect the consonantal forms of [i] and [u]): if we were to follow Hebrew usage in English we would write and print `cnsnts' for `consonants'. The letter aleph, adapted by the ancient Greeks to indicate the vowel alpha, which became our roman `a', is not a vowel but a consonant in Hebrew and other Semitic alphabets, representing a glottal stop (the sound between the two vowel sounds in the English `huh-uh', meaning `no'). Late in the history of the Hebrew alphabet, vowel `points', little dots and dashes below or above the letters to indicate the proper vowel, were added to many texts, often for the benefit of those who did not know the language very well, and today in Israel these `points' are added to words for very young children learning to read ­ up to the third grade or so. Languages are organized in many different ways, and the Semitic languages are so constituted that they are easy to read when words are written only with consonants. This way of writing only with consonants and semi-consonants (y as in `you', w) has led some linguists (Gelb 1963; Havelock 1963, p. 129) to call what other linguists call the Hebrew alphabet a syllabary, or perhaps an unvocalized or `reduced' syllabary. However, it appears somewhat awkward to think of the Hebrew letter beth (b) as a syllable when it in fact simply represents the phoneme [b], to which the reader has to add whatever vowel sound the word and context call for. Besides, when vowel points are used, they are added to the letters (above or below the line) just as vowels are added to our consonants. And

modern Israelis and Arabs, who agree on so little else, both generally agree that both are writing letters in an alphabet. For an understanding of the development of writing out of orality, it appears at least unobjectionable to think of the Semitic script simply as an alphabet of consonants (and semivowels) for which readers, as they read, simply and easily supply the appropriate vowels. When this is all said, however, about the Semitic alphabet, it does appear that the Greeks did something of major psychological importance when they developed the first alphabet complete with vowels. Havelock (1976) believes that this crucial, more nearly total transformation of the word from sound to sight gave ancient Greek culture its intellectual ascendancy over other ancient cultures. The reader of Semitic writing had to draw on non-textual as well as textual data: he had to know the language he was reading in order to know what vowels to supply between the consonants. Semitic writing was still very much immersed in the non-textual human lifeworld. The vocalic Greek alphabet was more remote from that world (as Plato's ideas were to be). It analyzed sound more abstractly into purely spatial components. It could be used to write or read words even from languages one did not know (allowing for some inaccuracies due to phonemic differences between languages). Little children could acquire the Greek alphabet when they were very young and their vocabulary limited. (It has just been noted that for Israeli schoolchildren to about the third grade vowel `points' have to be added to the ordinary consonantal Hebrew script.) The Greek alphabet was democratizing in the sense that it was easy for everyone to learn. It was also internationalizing in that it provided a way of processing even foreign tongues. This Greek achievement in abstractly analyzing the elusive world of sound into visual equivalents (not perfectly, of course, but in effect fully) both presaged and implemented their further analytic exploits. It appears that the structure of the Greek language, the fact that it was not based on a system like the Semitic that was hospitable to omission of vowels from writing, turned out to be a perhaps accidental but crucial intellectual advantage. Kerckhove (1981) has suggested that, more than other writing systems, the completely phonetic alphabet favors left-hemisphere activity in the brain, and thus on neurophysiological grounds fosters abstract, analytic thought.

orality and literacy

The reason why the alphabet was invented so late and why it was invented only once can be sensed if we reflect on the nature of sound. For the alphabet operates more directly on sound as sound than the other scripts, reducing sound directly to spatial equivalents, and in smaller, more analytic, more manageable units than a syllabary: instead of one symbol for the sound ba, you have two, b plus a. Sound, as has earlier been explained, exists only when it is going out of existence. I cannot have all of a word present at once: when I say `existence', by the time I get to the `-tence', the `exis-' is gone. The alphabet implies that matters are otherwise, that a word is a thing, not an event, that it is present all at once, and that it can be cut up into little pieces, which can even be written forwards and pronounced backwards: `p-a-r-t' can be pronounced `trap'. If you put the word `part' on a sound tape and reverse the tape, you do not get `trap', but a completely different sound, neither `part' nor `trap'. A picture, say, of a bird does not reduce sound to space, for it represents an object, not a word. It will be the equivalent of any number of words, depending on the language used to interpret it: oiseau, uccello, pájaro, Vogel, sae, tori, `bird'. All script represents words as in some way things, quiescent objects, immobile marks for assimilation by vision. Rebuses or phonograms, which occur irregularly in some pictographic writing, represent the sound of one word by the picture of another (the `sole' of a foot representing the `soul' as paired with body, in the fictitious example used above). But the rebus (phonogram), though it may represent several things, is still a picture of one of the things it represents. The alphabet, though it probably derives from pictograms, has lost all connection with things as things. It represents sound itself as a thing, transforming the evanescent world of sound to the quiescent, quasi-permanent world of space. The phonetic alphabet invented by ancient Semites and perfected by ancient Greeks, is by far the most adaptable of all writing systems in reducing sound to visible form. It is perhaps also the least aesthetic of all major writing systems: it can be beautifully designed, but never so exquisitely as Chinese characters. It is a democratizing script, easy for everybody to learn. Chinese character writing, like many other writing systems, is intrinsically élitist: to master it thoroughly requires protracted leisure. The democratizing quality of the alphabet can be seen

in South Korea. In Korean books and newspapers the text is a mixture of alphabetically spelt words and hundreds of different Chinese characters. But all public signs are always written in the alphabet alone, which virtually everyone can read since it is completely mastered in the lower grades of elementary school, whereas the 1800 han, or Chinese characters, minimally needed besides the alphabet for reading most literature in Korean, are not commonly all mastered before the end of secondary school. Perhaps the most remarkable single achievement in the history of the alphabet was in Korea, where in AD 1443 King Sejong of the Yi Dynasty decreed that an alphabet should be devised for Korean. Up to that time Korean had been written only with Chinese characters, laboriously adapted to fit (and interact with) the vocabulary of Korean, a language not at all related to Chinese (though it has many Chinese loan words, mostly so Koreanized as to be incomprehensible to any Chinese). Thousands upon thousands of Koreans ­ all Koreans who could write ­ had spent or were spending the better part of their lives mastering the complicated Sino-Korean chirography. They were hardly likely to welcome a new writing system which would render their laboriously acquired skills obsolete. But the Yi Dynasty was powerful and Sejong's decree in the face of massive anticipated resistance suggests that he had comparably powerful ego structures. The accommodation of the alphabet to a given language has generally taken many years, or generations. Sejong's assembly of scholars had the Korean alphabet ready in three years, a masterful achievement, virtually perfect in its accommodation to Korean phonemics and aesthetically designed to produce an alphabetic script with something of the appearance of a text in Chinese characters. But the reception of this remarkable achievement was predictable. The alphabet was used only for unscholarly, practical, vulgarian purposes. `Serious' writers continued to use the Chinese character writing in which they had so laboriously trained themselves. Serious literature was élitist and wanted to be known as élitist. Only in the twentieth century, with the greater democratization of Korea, did the alphabet achieve its present (still less than total) ascendancy.

orality and literacy

THE ONSET OF LITERACY
When a fully formed script of any sort, alphabetic or other, first makes its way from outside into a particular society, it does so necessarily at first in restricted sectors and with varying effects and implications. Writing is often regarded at first as an instrument of secret and magic power (Goody 1968b, p. 236). Traces of this early attitude toward writing can still show etymologically: the Middle English `grammarye' or grammar, referring to book-learning, came to mean occult or magical lore, and through one Scottish dialectical form has emerged in our present English vocabulary as `glamor' (spell-casting power). `Glamor girls' are really grammar girls. The futhark or runic alphabet of medieval Northern Europe was commonly associated with magic. Scraps of writing are used as magic amulets (Goody 1968b, pp. 201­ 3), but they also can be valued simply because of the wonderful permanence they confer on words. The Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe describes how in an Ibo village the one man who knew how to read hoarded in his house every bit of printed material that came his way ­ newspapers, cartons, receipts (Achebe 1961, pp. 120­1). It all seemed too remarkable to throw away. Some societies of limited literacy have regarded writing as dangerous to the unwary reader, demanding a guru-like figure to mediate between reader and text (Goody and Watt 1968, p. 13). Literacy can be restricted to special groups such as the clergy (Tambiah 1968, pp. 113­ 14). Texts can be felt to have intrinsic religious value: illiterates profit from rubbing the book on their foreheads, or from whirling prayerwheels bearing texts they cannot read (Goody 1968a, pp. 15­16). Tibetan monks used to sit on the banks of streams `printing pages of charms and formulas on the surface of the water with woodcut blocks' (Goody 1968a, p. 16, quoting R. B. Eckvall). The still flourishing `cargo cults' of some South Pacific islands are well known: illiterates or semiliterates think that the commercial papers ­ orders, bills of lading, receipts, and the like ­ that they know figure in shipping operations are magical instruments to make ships and cargo come in from across the sea, and they elaborate various rituals manipulating written texts in the hope that cargo will turn up for their own possession and use (Meggitt 1968, pp. 300­9). In ancient Greek culture Havelock discovers a

writing restructures consciousness

93

general pattern of restricted literacy applicable to many other cultures: shortly after the introduction of writing a `craft literacy' develops (Havelock 1963; cf. Havelock and Herschell 1978). At this stage writing is a trade practiced by craftsmen, whom others hire to write a letter or document as they might hire a stone-mason to build a house, or a shipwright to build a boat. Such was the state of affairs in West African kingdoms, such as Mali, from the Middle Ages into the twentieth century (Wilks 1968; Goody 1968b). At such a craft-literacy stage, there is no need for an individual to know reading and writing any more than any other trade. Only around Plato's time in ancient Greece, more than three centuries after the introduction of the Greek alphabet, was this stage transcended when writing was finally diffused through the Greek population and interiorized enough to affect thought processes generally (Havelock 1963). The physical properties of early writing materials encouraged the continuance of scribal culture (see Clanchy 1979, pp. 88­115, on `The technology of writing'). Instead of evenly surfaced machine-made paper and relatively durable ball-point pens, the early writer had more recalcitrant technological equipment. For writing surfaces, he had wet clay bricks, animal skins (parchment, vellum) scraped free of fat and hair, often smoothed with pumice and whitened with chalk, frequently reprocessed by scraping off an earlier text (palimpsests). Or he had the bark of trees, papyrus (better than most surfaces but still rough by high-technology standards), dried leaves or other vegetation, wax layered onto wooden tablets often hinged to form a diptych worn on a belt (these wax tablets were used for notes, the wax being smoothed over again for re-use), wooden rods (Clanchy 1979, p. 95) and other wooden and stone surfaces of various sorts. There were no corner stationery stores selling pads of paper. There was no paper. As inscribing tools the scribes had various kinds of styli, goose quills which had to be slit and sharpened over and over again with what we still call a `pen knife', brushes (particularly in East Asia), or various other instruments for incising surfaces and/or spreading inks or paints. Fluid inks were mixed in various ways and readied for use into hollow bovine horns (inkhorns) or in other acid resistant containers, or, commonly in East Asia, brushes were wetted and dabbed on dry ink blocks, as in watercolor painting.

94

orality and literacy

Special mechanical skills were required for working with such writing materials, and not all `writers' had such skills suitably developed for protracted composition. Paper made writing physically easier. But paper, manufactured in China probably by the second century BC and diffused by Arabs to the Middle East by the eighth century of the Christian era, was first manufactured in Europe only in the twelfth century. Longstanding oral mental habits of thinking through one's thoughts aloud encourage dictation, but so did the state of writing technology. In the physical act of writing, the medieval Englishman Orderic Vitalis says, `the whole body labors' (Clanchy 1979, p. 90). Through the Middle Ages in Europe authors often employed scribes. Composition in writing, working out one's thought pen-in-hand, particularly in briefer compositions, was, of course, practiced to some extent from antiquity, but it became widespread for literary and other prolonged composition at different times in different cultures. It was still rare in eleventh-century England, and, when it occurred, even this late, could be done in a psychological setting so oral that we find it hard to imagine. The eleventh-century Eadmer of St Albans says that, when he composed in writing, he felt he was dictating to himself (Clanchy 1979, p. 218). St Thomas Aquinas, who wrote his own manuscripts, organizes his Summa theologiae in quasi-oral format: each section or `question' begins with a recitation of objections against the position Thomas will take, then Thomas states his position, and finally answers the objections in order. Similarly, an early poet would write down a poem by imagining himself declaiming it to an audience. Few if any novelists today write a novel by imagining themselves declaiming it aloud, though they might be exquisitely aware of the sound effects of the words. High literacy fosters truly written composition, in which the author composes a text which is precisely a text, puts his or her words together on paper. This gives thought different contours from those of orally sustained thought. More will be said (that is, written) here later about the effects of literacy on thought processes.

FROM MEMORY TO WRITTEN RECORDS
Long after a culture has begun to use writing, it may still not give writing high ratings. A present-day literate usually assumes that written records have more force than spoken words as evidence of a long-past state of affairs, especially in court. Earlier cultures that knew literacy but had not so fully interiorized it, have often assumed quite the opposite. The amount of credence accorded to written records undoubtedly varied from culture to culture, but Clanchy's careful case history of the use of literacy for practical administrative purposes in eleventh- and twelfth-century England (1979) gives an informative sample of how much orality could linger in the presence of writing, even in an administrative milieu. In the period he studies, Clanchy finds that `documents did not immediately inspire trust' (Clanchy 1979, p. 230). People had to be persuaded that writing improved the old oral methods sufficiently to warrant all the expense and troublesome techniques it involved. Before the use of documents, collective oral testimony was commonly used to establish, for example, the age of feudal heirs. To settle a dispute in 1127 as to whether the customs dues at the port of Sandwich went to St Augustine's Abbey at Canterbury or to Christ Church, a jury was chosen consisting of twelve men from Dover and twelve from Sandwich, `mature, wise seniors of many years, having good testimony'. Each juror then swore that, as `I have received from my ancestors, and I have seen and heard from my youth', the tolls belong to Christ Church (Clanchy 1979, pp. 232­3). They were publicly remembering what others before them had remembered. Witnesses were prima facie more credible than texts because they could be challenged and made to defend their statements, whereas texts could not (this, it will be recalled, was exactly one of Plato's objections to writing). Notarial methods of authenticating documents undertake to build authenticating mechanisms into written texts, but notarial methods developed late in literate cultures, and much later in England than in Italy (Clanchy 1979, pp. 235­6). Written documents themselves were often authenticated not in writing but by symbolic objects (such as a knife, attached to the document by a parchment thong ­ Clanchy 1979, p. 24). Indeed symbolic objects alone could

96

orality and literacy

serve as instruments transferring property. In c. 1130, Thomas de Muschamps conveyed his estate of Hetherslaw to the monks at Durham by offering his sword on an altar (Clanchy 1979, p. 25). Even after the Domesday Book (1085­6) and the accompanying increase in written documentation, the story of the Earle Warrenne shows how the old oral state of mind still persisted: before the judges in quo warranto procedures under Edward I (reigned 1272­1306), the Earle Warrenne exhibited not a charter but `an ancient and rusty sword', protesting that his ancestors had come with William the Conqueror to take England by the sword and that he would defend his lands with the sword. Clanchy points out (1979, pp. 21­2) that the story is somewhat questionable because of certain inconsistencies, but notes also that its persistence attests to an earlier state of mind familiar with the witness value of symbolic gifts. Early charters conveying land in England were originally not even dated (1979, pp. 231, 236­41), probably for a variety of reasons. Clanchy suggests that the most profound reason was probably that `dating required the scribe to express an opinion about his place in time' (1979, p. 238), which demanded that he choose a point of reference. What point? Was he to locate this document by reference to the creation of the world? To the Crucifixion? To the birth of Christ? Popes dated documents this way, from Christ's birth, but was it presumptuous to date a secular document as popes dated theirs? In high technology cultures today, everyone lives each day in a frame of abstract computed time enforced by millions of printed calendars, clocks, and watches. In twelfth-century England there were no clocks or watches or wall or desk calendars. Before writing was deeply interiorized by print, people did not feel themselves situated every moment of their lives in abstract computed time of any sort. It appears unlikely that most persons in medieval or even Renaissance western Europe would ordinarily have been aware of the number of the current calendar year ­ from the birth of Christ or any other point in the past. Why should they be? Indecision concerning what point to compute from attested the trivialities of the issue. In a culture with no newspapers or other currently dated material to impinge on consciousness, what would be the point for most people in knowing the current calendar year? The abstract calendar number

writing restructures consciousness

97

would relate to nothing in real life. Most persons did not know and never even tried to discover in what calendar year they had been born. Moreover, charters were undoubtedly assimilated somewhat to symbolic gifts, such as knives or swords. These were identifiable by their looks. And indeed, charters were quite regularly forged to make them look like what a court (however erroneously) felt a charter should look like (Clanchy 1979, p. 249, citing P. H. Sawyer). `Forgers', Clanchy points out, were not `occasional deviants on the peripheries of legal practice' but `experts entrenched at the centre of literary and intellectual culture in the twelfth century.' Of the 164 now extant charters of Edward the Confessor, 44 are certainly forged, only 64 certainly authentic, and the rest uncertainly one or the other. The verifiable errors resulting from the still radically oral economic and juridical procedures that Clanchy reports were minimal because the fuller past was mostly inaccessible to consciousness. `Remembered truth was . . . flexible and up to date' (Clanchy 1979, p. 233). As has been seen in instances from modern Nigeria and Ghana (Goody and Watt 1968, pp. 31­4), in an oral economy of thought, matters from the past without any sort of present relevance commonly dropped into oblivion. Customary law, trimmed of material no longer of use, was automatically always up to date and thus youthful ­ a fact which, paradoxically, makes customary law seem inevitable and thus very old (cf. Clanchy 1979, p. 233). Persons whose world view has been formed by high literacy need to remind themselves that in functionally oral cultures the past is not felt as an itemized terrain, peppered with verifiable and disputed `facts' or bits of information. It is the domain of the ancestors, a resonant source for renewing awareness of present existence, which itself is not an itemized terrain either. Orality knows no lists or charts or figures. Goody (1977, pp. 52­111) has examined in detail the noetic significance of tables and lists, of which the calendar is one example. Writing makes such apparatus possible. Indeed, writing was in a sense invented largely to make something like lists: by far most of the earliest writing we know, that in the cuneiform script of the Sumerians beginning around 3500 BC, is account-keeping. Primary oral cultures commonly situate their equivalent of lists in narrative, as in the catalogue of the ships and captains in the Iliad (ii. 461­879) ­ not an objective tally but

98

orality and literacy

an operational display in a story about a war. In the text of the Torah, which set down in writing thought forms still basically oral, the equivalent of geography (establishing the relationship of one place to another) is put into a formulary action narrative (Numbers 33:16 ff): `Setting out from the desert of Sinai, they camped at Kibroth-hattaavah. Setting out from Kibroth-hattaavah, they camped at Hazeroth. Setting out from Hazeroth, they camped at Rithmah . . .', and so on for many more verses. Even genealogies out of such orally framed tradition are in effect commonly narrative. Instead of a recitation of names, we find a sequence of `begats', of statements of what someone did: `Irad begat Mehajael, Mehajael begat Methusael, Methusael begat Lamech' (Genesis 4:18). This sort of aggregation derives partly from the oral drive to use formulas, partly from the oral mnemonic drive to exploit balance (recurrence of subject-predicate-object produces a swing which aids recall and which a mere sequence of names would lack), partly from the oral drive to redundancy (each person is mentioned twice, as begetter and begotten), and partly from the oral drive to narrate rather than simply to juxtapose (the persons are not immobilized as in a police line-up, but are doing something ­ namely, begetting). These biblical passages obviously are written records, but they come from an orally constituted sensibility and tradition. They are not felt as thing-like, but as reconstitutions of events in time. Orally presented sequences are always occurrences in time, impossible to `examine', because they are not presented visually but rather are utterances which are heard. In a primary oral culture or a culture with heavy oral residue, even genealogies are not `lists' of data but rather `memory of songs sung'. Texts are thing-like, immobilized in visual space, subject to what Goody calls `backward scanning' (1977, pp. 49­50). Goody shows in detail how, when anthropologists display on a written or printed surface lists of various items found in oral myths (clans, regions of the earth, kinds of winds, and so on), they actually deform the mental world in which the myths have their own existence. The satisfaction that myths provide is essentially not `coherent' in a tabular way. Lists of the sort Goody discusses are of course useful if we are reflectively aware of the distortion they inevitably introduce. Visual presentation of verbalized material in space has its own particular economy, its own laws of motion and structure. Texts in various scripts

writing restructures consciousness

99

around the world are read variously from right to left, or left to right, or top to bottom, or all these ways at once as in boustrophedon writing, but never anywhere, so far as is known, from bottom to top. Texts assimilate utterance to the human body. They introduce a feeling for `headings' in accumulations of knowledge: `chapter' derives from the Latin caput, meaning head (as of the human body). Pages have not only `heads' but also `feet', for footnotes. References are given to what is `above' and `below' in a text when what is meant is several pages back or farther on. The significance of the vertical and the horizontal in texts deserves serious study. Kerckhove (1981) suggests that growth in lefthemisphere dominance governed the drift in early Greek writing from right-to-left movement, to boustrophedon movement (`ox-plowing' pattern, one line going right, then a turn around a corner into the next line going left, the letters inverted according to the direction of the line), to stoichedon style (vertical lines), and finally to definitive leftto-right movement on a horizontal line. All this is quite a different world of order from anything in the oral sensibility, which has no way of operating with `headings' or verbal linearity. Across the world the alphabet, the ruthlessly efficient reducer of sound to space, is pressed into direct service for setting up the new space-defined sequences: items are marked a, b, c, and so on to indicate their sequences, and even poems in the early days of literacy are composed with the first letter of the first word of successive lines following the order of the alphabet. The alphabet as a simple sequence of letters is a major bridge between oral mnemonic and literate mnemonics: generally the sequence of the letters of the alphabet is memorized orally and then used for largely visual retrieval of materials, as in indexes. Charts, which range elements of thought not simply in one line of rank but simultaneously in horizontal and various cross-cross orders, represent a frame of thought even farther removed than lists are from the oral noetic processes which such charts are supposed to represent. The extensive use of lists and particularly of charts so commonplace in our high-technology cultures is a result not simply of writing, but of the deep interiorization of print (Ong 1958b, pp. 307­18, and passim), which implements the use of fixed diagrammatic word-charts and other informational uses of neutral space far beyond anything feasible in any writing culture.

100 orality and literacy SOME DYNAMICS OF TEXTUALITY
The condition of words in a text is quite different from their condition in spoken discourse. Although they refer to sounds and are meaningless unless they can be related ­ externally or in the imagination ­ to the sounds or, more precisely, the phonemes they encode, written words are isolated from the fuller context in which spoken words come into being. The word in its natural, oral habitat is a part of a real, existential present. Spoken utterance is addressed by a real, living person to another real, living person or real, living persons, at a specific time in a real setting which includes always much more than mere words. Spoken words are always modifications of a total situation which is more than verbal. They never occur alone, in a context simply of words. Yet words are alone in a text. Moreover, in composing a text, in `writing' something, the one producing the written utterance is also alone. Writing is a solipsistic operation. I am writing a book which I hope will be read by hundreds of thousands of people, so I must be isolated from everyone. While writing the present book, I have left word that I am `out' for hours and days ­ so that no one, including persons who will presumably read the book, can interrupt my solitude. In a text even the words that are there lack their full phonetic qualities. In oral speech, a word must have one or another intonation or tone of voice ­ lively, excited, quiet, incensed, resigned, or whatever. It is impossible to speak a word orally without any intonation. In a text punctuation can signal tone minimally: a question mark or a comma, for example, generally calls for the voice to be raised a bit. Literate tradition, adopted and adapted by skilled critics, can also supply some extratextual clues for intonations, but not complete ones. Actors spend hours determining how actually to utter the words in the text before them. A given passage might be delivered by one actor in a shout, by another in a whisper. Extratextual context is missing not only for readers but also for the writer. Lack of verifiable context is what makes writing normally so much more agonizing an activity than oral presentation to a real audience. `The writer's audience is always a fiction' (Ong 1977, pp. 53­81). The writer must set up a role in which absent and often

writing restructures consciousness

101

unknown readers can cast themselves. Even in writing to a close friend I have to fictionalize a mood for him, to which he is expected to conform. The reader must also fictionalize the writer. When my friend reads my letter, I may be in an entirely different frame of mind from when I wrote it. Indeed, I may very well be dead. For a text to convey its message, it does not matter whether the author is dead or alive. Most books extant today were written by persons now dead. Spoken utterance comes only from the living. Even in a personal diary addressed to myself I must fictionalize the addressee. Indeed, the diary demands, in a way, the maximum fictionalizing of the utterer and the addressee. Writing is always a kind of imitation talking, and in a diary I therefore am pretending that I am talking to myself. But I never really talk this way to myself. Nor could I without writing or indeed without print. The personal diary is a very late literary form, in effect unknown until the seventeenth century (Boerner 1969). The kind of verbalized solipsistic reveries it implies are a product of consciousness as shaped by print culture. And for which self am I writing? Myself today? As I think I will be ten years from now? As I hope I will be? For myself as I imagine myself or hope others may imagine me? Questions such as this can and do fill diary writers with anxieties and often enough lead to discontinuation of diaries. The diarist can no longer live with his or her fiction. The ways in which readers are fictionalized is the underside of literary history, of which the topside is the history of genres and the handling of character and plot. Early writing provides the reader with conspicuous help for situating himself imaginatively. It presents philosophical material in dialogues, such as those of Plato's Socrates, which the reader can imagine himself overhearing. Or episodes are to be imagined as told to a live audience on successive days. Later, in the Middle Ages, writing will present philosophical and theological texts in objection-and-response form, so that the reader can imagine an oral disputation. Boccaccio and Chaucer will provide the reader with fictional groups of men and women telling stories to one another, that is, a `frame story', so that the reader can pretend to be one of the listening company. But who is talking to whom in Pride and Prejudice or in Le Rouge et le noir, or in Adam Bede? Nineteenth-century novelists self-consciously intone, `dear reader', over and over again to remind themselves that

102 orality and literacy
they are not telling a story but writing one in which both author and reader are having difficulty situating themselves. The psychodynamics of writing matured very slowly in narrative. And what is the reader supposed to make himself out to be in Finnegans Wake? Only a reader. But of a special fictional sort. Most readers of English cannot or will not make themselves into the special kind of reader Joyce demands. Some take courses in universities to learn how to fictionalize themselves à la Joyce. Although Joyce's text is very oral in the sense that it reads well aloud, the voice and its hearer do not fit into any imaginable real-life setting, but only the imaginative setting of Finnegans Wake, which is imaginable only because of the writing and print that has gone before it. Finnegans Wake was composed in writing, but for print: with its idiosyncratic spelling and usages, it would be virtually impossible to multiply it accurately in handwritten copies. There is no mimesis here in Aristotle's sense, except ironically. Writing is indeed the seedbed of irony, and the longer the writing (and print) tradition endures, the heavier the ironic growth becomes (Ong 1977, pp. 272­302).

DISTANCE, PRECISION, GRAPHOLECTS AND MAGNAVOCABULARIES
The distancing which writing effects develops a new kind of precision in verbalization by removing it from the rich but chaotic existential context of much oral utterance. Oral performances can be impressive in their magniloquence and communal wisdom, whether they are lengthy, as in formal narrative, or brief and apophthegmatic, as in proverbs. Yet wisdom has to do with a total and relatively infrangible social context. Orally managed language and thought are not noted for analytic precision. Of course, all language and thought are to some degree analytic: they break down the dense continuum of experience, William James's `big, blooming, buzzing confusion', into more or less separate parts, meaningful segments. But written words sharpen analysis, for the individual words are called on to do more. To make yourself clear without gesture, without facial expression, without intonation, without a real hearer, you have to foresee circumspectly all possible meanings a

writing restructures consciousness

103

statement may have for any possible reader in any possible situation, and you have to make your language work so as to come clear all by itself, with no existential context. The need for this exquisite circumspection makes writing the agonizing work it commonly is. What Goody (1977, p. 128) calls `backward scanning' makes it possible in writing to eliminate inconsistencies (Goody 1977, pp. 49­50), to choose between words with a reflective selectivity that invests thought and words with new discriminatory powers. In an oral culture, the flow of words, the corresponding flood of thought, the copia advocated in Europe by rhetoricians from classical antiquity through the Renaissance, tends to manage discrepancies by glossing them over ­ the etymology here is telling, glossa, tongue, by `tonguing' them over. With writing, words once `uttered', outered, put down on the surface, can be eliminated, erased, changed. There is no equivalent for this in an oral performance, no way to erase a spoken word: corrections do not remove an infelicity or an error, they merely supplement it with denial and patchwork. The bricolage or patchwork that Lévi-Strauss (1966, 1970) finds characteristic of `primitive' or `savage' thought patterns can be seen here to be due to the oral noetic situation. Corrections in oral performance tend to be counterproductive, to render the speaker unconvincing. So you keep them to a minimum or avoid them altogether. In writing, corrections can be tremendously productive, for how can the reader know they have even been made? Of course, once the chirographically initiated feel for precision and analytic exactitude is interiorized, it can feed back into speech, and does. Although Plato's thought is couched in dialogue form, its exquisite precision is due to the effects of writing on the noetic processes, for the dialogues are in fact written texts. Through a chirographically managed text couched in dialogue form, they move dialectically toward the analytic clarification of issues which Socrates and Plato had inherited in more `totalized', non-analytic, narratized, oral form. In The Greek Concept of Justice: From Its Shadow in Homer to Its Substance in Plato (1978a), Havelock has treated the movement which Plato's work brought to a head. Nothing of Plato's analytic targeting on an abstract concept of justice is to be found in any known purely oral cultures. Similarly, the deadly targeting on issues and on adversaries' weaknesses in Cicero's orations is the work of a literate mind, although we know

104 orality and literacy
that Cicero did not compose his orations in script before he gave them but wrote down afterwards the texts that we now have (Ong 1967b, pp. 56­7). The exquisitely analytic oral disputations in medieval universities and in later scholastic tradition into the present century (Ong 1981, pp. 137­8) were the work of minds honed by writing texts and by reading and commenting on texts, orally and in writing. By separating the knower from the known (Havelock 1963), writing makes possible increasingly articulate introspectivity, opening the psyche as never before not only to the external objective world quite distinct from itself but also to the interior self against whom the objective world is set. Writing makes possible the great introspective religious traditions such as Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. All these have sacred texts. The ancient Greeks and Romans knew writing and used it, particularly the Greeks, to elaborate philosophical and scientific knowledge. But they developed no sacred texts comparable to the Vedas or the Bible or the Koran, and their religion failed to establish itself in the recesses of the psyche which writing had opened for them. It became only a genteel, archaic literary resource for writers such as Ovid and a framework of external observances, lacking urgent personal meaning. Writing develops codes in a language different from oral codes in the same language. Basil Bernstein (1974, pp. 134­5, 176, 181, 197­ 8) distinguishes the `restricted linguistic code' or `public language' of the lower-class English dialects in Britain and the `elaborated linguistic code' or `private language' of the middle- and upper-class dialects. Walt Wolfram (1972) had earlier noted distinctions like Bernstein's between Black American English and standard American English. The restricted linguistic code can be at least as expressive and precise as the elaborated code in contexts which are familiar and shared by speaker and hearer. For dealing with the unfamiliar expressively and precisely, however, the restricted linguistic code will not do; an elaborated linguistic code is absolutely needed. The restricted linguistic code is evidently largely oral in origin and use and, like oral thought and expression generally, operates contextually, close to the human lifeworld: the group whom Bernstein found using this code were messenger boys with no grammar school education. Their expression has a formula-like quality and strings thoughts together not in careful

writing restructures consciousness

105

subordination but `like beads on a frame' (1974, p. 134) ­ recognizably the formulaic and aggregative mode of oral culture. The elaborated code is one which is formed with the necessary aid of writing, and, for full elaboration, of print. The group Bernstein found using this code were from the six major public schools that provided the most intensive education in reading and writing in Britain (1974, p. 83). Bernstein's `restricted' and `elaborated' linguistic codes could be relabeled `oralbased' and `text-based' codes respectively. Olson (1977) has shown how orality relegates meaning largely to context whereas writing concentrates meaning in language itself. Writing and print develop special kinds of dialects. Most languages have never been committed to writing at all, as has been seen (p. 7 above). But certain languages, or more properly dialects, have invested massively in writing. Often, as in England or Germany or Italy, where a cluster of dialects is found, one regional dialectic has developed chirographically beyond all others, for economic, political, religious, or other reasons, and has eventually become a national language. In England this happened to the upper-class London English dialect, in Germany, to Hochdeutsch (the German of the highlands to the south), in Italy to Tuscan. While it is true that these were all at root regional and/ or class dialects, their status as chirographically controlled national languages has made them different kinds ofdialects or language from those which are not written on a large scale. As Guxman has pointed out (1970, pp. 773­6), a national written language has had to be isolated from its original dialect base, has discarded certain dialectal forms, has developed various layers of vocabulary from sources not dialectal at all, and has developed also certain syntactical peculiarities. This kind of established written language Haugen (1966, pp. 50­71) has aptly styled a `grapholect'. A modern grapholect such as `English', to use the simple term which is commonly used to refer to this grapholect, has been worked over for centuries, first and most intensively, it seems, by the chancery of Henry V (Richardson 1980), then by normative theorists, grammarians, lexicographers, and others. It has been recorded massively in writing and print and now on computers so that those competent in the grapholect today can establish easy contact not only with millions of other persons but also with the thought of centuries past, for the

106 orality and literacy
other dialects of English as well as thousands of foreign languages are interpreted in the grapholect. In this sense, the grapholect includes all the other dialects: it explains them as they cannot explain themselves. The grapholect bears the marks of the millions of minds which have used it to share their consciousnesses with one another. Into it has been hammered a massive vocabulary of an order of magnitude impossible for an oral tongue. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1971) states in its Preface that it could have included `many times' more than the 450,000 words it does include. Assuming that `many times' must mean at least three times, and rounding out the figures, we can understand that the editors have on hand a record of some million and a half words used in print in English. Oral languages and oral dialects can get along with a small fraction of this number. The lexical richness of grapholects begins with writing, but its fullness is due to print. For the resources of a modern grapholect are available largely through dictionaries. There are limited word lists of various sorts from very early in the history of writing (Goody 1977, pp. 74­111), but until print is well established there are no dictionaries that undertake generalized comprehensive accounts of the words in use in any language. It is easy to understand why this is so if you think of what it would mean to make even a few dozen relatively accurate handwritten copies of Webster's Third or even of the much smaller Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary. Dictionaries such as these are light-years away from the world of oral cultures. Nothing illustrates more strikingly how it is that writing and print alter states of consciousness. Where grapholects exist, `correct' grammar and usage are popularly interpreted as the grammar and usage of the grapholect itself to the exclusion of the grammar and usage of other dialects. The sensory bases of the very concept of order are largely visual (Ong 1967b, pp. 108, 136­7), and the fact that the grapholect is written or, a fortiori, printed encourages attributing to it a special normative power for keeping language in order. But when other dialects of a given language besides the grapholect vary from the grammar of the grapholect, they are not ungrammatical: they are simply using a different grammar, for language is structure, and it is impossible to use language without a grammar. In the light of this fact, linguists today commonly make the point that all dialects are equal in the sense that none has a grammar

writing restructures consciousness

107

intrinsically more `correct' than that of others. But Hirsch (1977, pp. 43­50) makes the further point that in a profound sense no other dialect, for example, in English or German or Italian, has anything remotely like the resources of the grapholect. It is bad pedagogy to insist that because there is nothing `wrong' with other dialects, it makes no difference whether or not speakers of another dialect learn the grapholect, which has resources of a totally different order of magnitude.

INTERACTIONS: RHETORIC AND THE PLACES
Two special major developments in the West derive from and affect the interaction of writing and orality. These are academic rhetoric and Learned Latin. In his Volume III of the Oxford History of English Literature, C. S. Lewis observed that `rhetoric is the greatest barrier between us and our ancestors' (1954, p. 60). Lewis honors the magnitude of the subject by refusing to treat it, despite its overwhelming relevance for the culture of all ages at least up to the Age of Romanticism (Ong 1971, pp. 1­22, 255­83). The study of rhetoric dominant in all western cultures until that time had begun as the core of ancient Greek education and culture. In ancient Greece, the study of `philosophy', represented by Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, for all its subsequent fecundity, was a relatively minor element in the total Greek culture, never competitive with rhetoric either in the number of its practitioners or in its immediate social effects (Marrou 1956, pp. 194­205), as Socrates' unhappy fate suggests. Rhetoric was at root the art of public speaking, of oral address, for persuasion (forensic and deliberative rhetoric) or exposition (epideictic rhetoric). The Greek rhetor is from the same root as the Latin orator and means a public speaker. In the perspectives worked out by Havelock (1963) it would appear obvious that in a very deep sense the rhetorical tradition represented the old oral world and the philosophical tradition the new chirographic structures of thought. Like Plato, C. S. Lewis was in effect unwittingly turning his back on the old oral world. Over the centuries, until the Age of Romanticism (when the thrust of rhetoric was diverted, definitively if not totally, from oral

108 orality and literacy
performance to writing), explicit or even implicit commitment to the formal study and formal practice of rhetoric is an index of the amount of residual primary orality in a given culture (Ong 1971, pp. 23­103). Homeric and the pre-Homeric Greeks, like oral peoples generally, practiced public speaking with great skill long before their skills were reduced to an `art', that is, to a body of sequentially organized, scientific principles which explained and abetted what verbal persuasion consisted in. Such an `art' is presented in Aristotle's Art of Rhetoric (techne ¯ rhe ¯torike ¯). Oral cultures, as has been seen, can have no `arts' of this scientifically organized sort. No one could or can simply recite extempore a treatise such as Aristotle's Art of Rhetoric, as someone in an oral culture would have to do if this sort of understanding were to be implemented. Lengthy oral productions follow more agglomerative, less analytic, patterns. The `art' of rhetoric, though concerned with oral speech, was, like other `arts', the product of writing. Persons from a high-technology culture who become aware of the vast literature of the past dealing with rhetoric, from classical antiquity through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and on into the Age of the Enlightenment (e.g. Kennedy 1980; Murphy 1974; Howell 1956, 1971), of the universal and obsessive interest in the subject through the ages and the amount of time spent studying it, of its vast and intricate terminology for classifying hundreds of figures of speech in Greek and Latin ­ antinomasia or pronominatio, paradiastole or distinctio, anticategoria or accusatio concertativa, and so on and on and on ­ (Lanham 1968; Sonnino 1968) are likely to react with, `What a waste of time!' But for its first discoverers or inventors, the Sophists of fifth-century Greece, rhetoric was a marvelous thing. It provided a rationale for what was dearest to their hearts, effective and often showy oral performance, something which had been a distinctively human part of human existence for ages but which, before writing, could never have been so reflectively prepared for or accounted for. Rhetoric retained much of the old oral feeling for thought and expression as basically agonistic and formulaic. This shows clearly in rhetorical teaching about the `places' (Ong 1967b, pp. 56­87; 1971, pp. 147­87; Howell 1956, Index). With its agonistic heritage, rhetorical teaching assumed that the aim of more or less all discourse was to prove or disprove a point, against some opposition. Developing a

writing restructures consciousness

109

subject was thought of as a process of `invention', that is, of finding in the store of arguments that others had always exploited those arguments which were applicable to your case. These arguments were considered to be lodged or `seated' (Quintilian's term) in the `places' (topoi in Greek, loci in Latin), and were often called the loci communes or commonplaces when they were thought of as providing arguments common to any and all subject matter. From at least the time of Quintilian, loci communes was taken in two different senses. First, it referred to the `seats' of arguments, considered as abstract `headings' in today's parlance, such as definition, cause, effect, opposities, likenesses, and so on (the assortment varied in length from one author to another). Wanting to develop a `proof ' ­ we should say simply to develop a line of thought ­ on any subject, such as loyalty, evil, the guilt of an accused criminal, friendship, war, or whatever, one could always find something to say by defining, looking to causes, effects, opposites, and all the rest. These headings can be styled the `analytic commonplaces'. Secondly, loci communes or commonplaces referred to collections of sayings (in effect, formulas) on various topics ­ such as loyalty, decadence, friendship, or whatever ­ that could be worked into one's own speech-making or writing. In this sense the loci communes can be styled `cumulative commonplaces'. Both the analytic and the cumulative commonplaces, it is clear, kept alive the old oral feeling for thought and expression essentially made up of formulaic or otherwise fixed materials inherited from the past. To say this is not to explicate the whole of the complex doctrine, which itself was integral to the massive art of rhetoric. Rhetoric of course is essentially antithetical (Durand 1960, pp. 451, 453­9), for the orator speaks in the face of at least implied adversaries. Oratory has deep agonistic roots (Ong 1967b, pp. 192­222; 1981, pp. 119­48). The development of the vast rhetorical tradition was distinctive of the West and was related, whether as cause or effect or both, to the tendency among the Greeks and their cultural epigoni to maximize oppositions, in the mental as in the extramental world: this by contrast with Indians and Chinese, who programmatically minimized them (Lloyd 1966; Oliver 1971). From Greek antiquity on, the dominance of rhetoric in the academic background produced throughout the literate world an impression,

110 orality and literacy
real if often vague, that oratory was the paradigm of all verbal expression, and kept the agonistic pitch of discourse exceedingly high by present-day standards. Poetry itself was often assimilated to epideictic oratory, and was considered to be concerned basically with praise or blame (as much oral, and even written, poetry is even today). Into the nineteenth century most literary style throughout the West was formed by academic rhetoric, in one way or another, with one notable exception: the literary style of female authors. Of the females who became published writers, as many did from the 1600s on, almost none had any such training. In medieval times and after, the education of girls was often intensive and produced effective managers of households, of sometimes fifty to eighty persons, which were often sizable businesses (Markham 1675, The English House-Wife), but this education was not acquired in academic institutions, which taught rhetoric and all other subjects in Latin. When they began to enter schools in some numbers during the seventeenth century, girls entered not the mainline Latin schools but the newer vernacular schools. These were practically oriented, for commerce and domestic affairs, whereas the older schools with Latin-based instruction were for those aspiring to be clergy, lawyers, physicians, diplomats, and other public servants. Women writers were no doubt influenced by works that they had read emanating from the Latin-based, academic, rhetorical tradition, but they themselves normally expressed themselves in a different, far less oratorical voice, which had a great deal to do with the rise of the novel.

INTERACTIONS: LEARNED LANGUAGES
The second massive development in the West affecting the interaction of writing and orality was Learned Latin. Learned Latin was a direct result of writing. Between about AD 550 and 700 the Latin spoken as a vernacular in various parts of Europe had evolved into various early forms of Italian, Spanish, Catalan, French, and the other Romance languages. By AD 700, speakers of these offshoots of Latin could no longer understand the old written Latin, intelligible perhaps to some of their greatgrandparents. Their spoken language had moved too far away from its origins. But schooling, and with it most official discourse of Church or state, continued in Latin. There was really no alternative.

111

Europe was a morass of hundreds of languages and dialects, most of them never written to this day. Tribes speaking countless Germanic and Slavic dialects, and even more exotic, non-Indo-European languages such as Magyar and Finnish and Turkish, were moving into western Europe. There was no way to translate the works, literary, scientific, philosophical, medical or theological, taught in schools and universities, into the swarming, oral vernaculars which often had different, mutually unintelligible forms among populations perhaps only fifty miles apart. Until one or another dialect for economic or other reasons became dominant enough to gain adherents even from other dialectical regions (as the East Midland dialect did in England or Hochdeutsch in Germany), the only practical policy was to teach Latin to the limited numbers of boys going to school. Once a mother tongue, Latin thus became a school language only, spoken not only in the classroom but also, in principle if far from always in fact, everywhere else on the school premises. By prescription of school statutes Latin had become Learned Latin, a language completely controlled by writing, whereas the new Romance vernaculars had developed out of Latin as languages had always developed, orally. Latin had undergone a sound-sight split. Because of its base in academia, which was totally male ­ with exceptions so utterly rare as to be quite negligible ­ Learned Latin had another feature in common with rhetoric besides its classical provenance. For well over a thousand years, it was sex-linked, a language written and spoken only by males, learned outside the home in a tribal setting which was in effect a male puberty rite setting, complete with physical punishment and other kinds of deliberately imposed hardships (Ong 1971, pp. 113­41; 1981, pp. 119­48). It had no direct connection with anyone's unconscious of the sort that mother tongues, learned in infancy, always have. Learned Latin related to orality and literacy, however, in paradoxical ways. On the one hand, as just noted, it was a chirographically controlled language. Of the millions who spoke it for the next 1400 years, every one was able also to write it. There were no purely oral users. But chirographic control of Learned Latin did not preclude its alliance with orality. Paradoxically, the textuality that kept Latin rooted in classical antiquity thereby kept it rooted also in orality, for the classical ideal of education had been to produce not the effective writer but the rhetor,

112 orality and literacy
the orator, the public speaker. The grammar of Learned Latin came from this old oral world. So did its basic vocabulary, although, like all languages actually in use, it incorporated thousands of new words over the centuries. Devoid of baby-talk, insulated from the earliest life of childhood where language has its deepest psychic roots, a first language to none of its users, pronounced across Europe in often mutually unintelligible ways but always written the same way, Learned Latin was a striking exemplification of the power of writing for isolating discourse and of the unparalleled productivity of such isolation. Writing, as has earlier been seen, serves to separate and distance the knower and the known and thus to establish objectivity. It has been suggested (Ong 1977, pp. 24­9) that Learned Latin effects even greater objectivity by establishing knowledge in a medium insulated from the emotion-charged depths of one's mother tongue, thus reducing interference from the human lifeworld and making possible the exquisitely abstract world of medieval scholasticism and of the new mathematical modern science which followed on the scholastic experience. Without Learned Latin, it appears that modern science would have got under way with greater difficulty, if it had got under way at all. Modern science grew in Latin soil, for philosophers and scientists through the time of Sir Isaac Newton commonly both wrote and did their abstract thinking in Latin. Interaction between such a chirographically controlled language as Learned Latin and the various vernaculars (mother tongues) is still far from being completely understood. There is no way simply to `translate' a language such as Learned Latin into languages like the vernaculars. Translation was transformation. Interaction produced all sorts of special results. Bäuml (1980, p. 264) has called attention, for example, to some of the effects when metaphors from a consciously metaphorical Latin were shifted into less metaphoricized mother tongues. During this period, other chirographically controlled, sexlinked male languages developed in Europe and Asia where sizable literate populations wanted to share a common intellectual heritage. Pretty much coeval with Learned Latin were Rabbinic Hebrew, Classical Arabic, Sanskrit, and Classical Chinese, with Byzantine Greek a sixth, much less definitively learned language, for vernacular Greek kept close contact with it (Ong 1977, pp. 28­34). These languages were all no

writing restructures consciousness

113

longer in use as mother tongues (that is, in the straightforward sense, not used by mothers in raising children). They were never first languages for any individual, were controlled exclusively by writing, were spoken by males only (with negligible exceptions, though perhaps with more exceptions for Classical Chinese than for the others), and were spoken only by those who could write them and who, indeed, had learned them initially by the use of writing. Such languages are no more, and it is difficult today to sense their earlier power. All languages used for learned discourse today are also mother tongues (or, in the case of Arabic, are more and more assimilating to themselves mother tongues). Nothing shows more convincingly than this disappearance of chirographically controlled language how writing is losing its earlier power monopoly (though not its importance) in today's world.

TENACIOUSNESS OF ORALITY
As the paradoxical relationships of orality and literacy in rhetoric and Learned Latin suggest, the transition from orality to literacy was slow (Ong 1967b, pp. 53­87; 1971, pp. 23­48). The Middle Ages used texts far more than ancient Greece and Rome, teachers lectured on texts in the universities, and yet never tested knowledge or intellectual prowess by writing, but always by oral dispute ­ a practice continued in diminishing ways into the nineteenth century and today still surviving vestigially in the defense of the doctoral dissertation in the fewer and fewer places where this is practiced. Though Renaissance humanism invented modern textual scholarship and presided over the development of letterpress printing, it also harked back to antiquity and thereby gave new life to orality. English style in the Tudor period (Ong 1971, pp. 23­47) and even much later carried heavy oral residue in its use of epithets, balance, antithesis, formulary structures, and commonplace materials. And so with western European literary styles generally. In western classical antiquity, it was taken for granted that a written text of any worth was meant to be and deserved to be read aloud, and the practice of reading texts aloud continued, quite commonly with many variations, through the nineteenth century (Balogh 1926). This practice strongly influenced literary style from antiquity until rather recent times (Balogh 1926; Crosby 1936; Nelson 1976­7; Ahern

114 orality and literacy
1982). Still yearning for the old orality, the nineteenth century developed `elocution' contests, which tried to repristinate printed texts, using careful artistry to memorize the texts verbatim and recite them so that they would sound like extempore oral productions (Howell 1971, pp. 144­256). Dickens read selections from his novels on the orator's platform. The famous McGuffey's Readers, published in the United States in some 120 million copies between 1836 and 1920, were designed as remedial readers to improve not the reading for comprehension which we idealize today, but oral, declamatory reading. The McGuffey's specialized in passages from `sound-conscious' literature concerned with great heroes (`heavy' oral characters). They provided endless oral pronunciation and breathing drills (Lynn 1973, pp. 16, 20). Rhetoric itself gradually but inevitably migrated from the oral to the chirographic world. From classical antiquity the verbal skills learned in rhetoric were put to use not only in oratory but also in writing. By the sixteenth century rhetoric textbooks were commonly omitting from the traditional five parts of rhetoric (invention, arrangement, style, memory and delivery) the fourth part, memory, which was not applicable to writing. They were also minimizing the last part, delivery (Howell 1956, pp. 146­72, 270, et passim). By and large, they made these changes with specious explanations or no explanation at all. Today, when curricula list rhetoric as a subject, it usually means simply the study of how to write effectively. But no one ever consciously launched a program to give this new direction to rhetoric: the `art' simply followed the drift of consciousness away from an oral to a writing economy. The drift was completed before it was noticed that anything was happening. Once it was completed, rhetoric was no longer the allpervasive subject it had once been: education could no longer be described as fundamentally rhetorical as it could be in past ages. The three Rs ­ reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic ­ representing an essentially nonrhetorical, bookish, commercial and domestic education, gradually took over from the traditional orally grounded, heroic, agonistic education that had generally prepared young men in the past for teaching and professional, ecclesiastical, or political public service. In the process, as rhetoric and Latin went out, women entered more and more into academia, which also became more and more commercially oriented (Ong 1967b, pp. 241­55).

PRINT, SPACE AND CLOSURE
HEARING-DOMINANCE YIELDS TO SIGHT-DOMINANCE
Although this book attends chiefly to oral culture and to the changes in thought and expression introduced by writing, it must give some brief attention to print, for print both reinforces and transforms the effects of writing on thought and expression. Since the shift from oral to written speech is essentially a shift from sound to visual space, here the effects of print on the use of visual space can be the central, though not the only, focus of attention. This focus brings out not only the relationship between print and writing, but also the relationship of print to the orality still residual in writing and early print culture. Moreover, while all the effects of print do not reduce to its effects on the use of visual space, many of the other effects do relate to this use in various ways. In a work of this scope there is no way even to enumerate all the effects of print. Even a cursory glance at Elizabeth Eisenstein's two volumes, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change (1979), makes abundantly evident how diversified and vast the particular effects of print have been. Eisenstein spells out in detail how print made the Italian Renaissance a permanent European Renaissance, how it implemented the Protestant Reformation and reoriented Catholic religious practice, how it affected the development of modern capitalism, implemented

116 orality and literacy
western European exploration of the globe, changed family life and politics, diffused knowledge as never before, made universal literacy a serious objective, made possible the rise of modern sciences, and otherwise altered social and intellectual life. In The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962) and Understanding Media (1964) Marshall McLuhan has called attention to many of the subtler ways print has affected consciousness, as George Steiner has also done in Language and Silence (1967) and as I have undertaken to do elsewhere (Ong 1958b; 1967b; 1971; 1977). These subtler effects of print on consciousness, rather than readily observable social effects, concern us particularly here. For thousands of years human beings have been printing designs from variously carved surfaces, and since the seventh or eighth century Chinese, Koreans and Japanese have been printing verbal texts, at first from wood blocks engraved in relief (Carter 1955). But the crucial development in the global history of printing was the invention of alphabetic letterpress print in fifteenth-century Europe. Alphabetic writing had broken the word up into spatial equivalents of phonemic units (in principle, though the letters never quite worked out as totally phonemic indicators). But the letters used in writing do not exist before the text in which they occur. With alphabetic letterpress print it is otherwise. Words are made out of units (types) which pre-exist as units before the words which they will constitute. Print suggests that words are things far more than writing ever did. Like the alphabet, alphabetic letterpress print was a nonce invention (Ong 1967b, and references there cited). The Chinese had had movable type, but no alphabet, only characters, basically pictographic. Before the mid-1400s the Koreans and Uigur Turks had both the alphabet and movable type, but the movable types bore not separate letters but whole words. Alphabet letterpress printing, in which each letter was cast on a separate piece of metal, or type, marked a psychological breakthrough of the first order. It embedded the word itself deeply in the manufacturing process and made it into a kind of commodity. The first assembly line, a technique of manufacture which in a series of set steps produces identical complex objects made up of replaceable parts, was not one which produced stoves or shoes or weaponry but one which produced the printed book. In the late 1700s, the industrial revolution applied to other manufacturing the replaceable-part

117

techniques which printers had worked with for three hundred years. Despite the assumptions of many semiotic structuralists, it was print, not writing, that effectively reified the word, and, with it, noetic activity (Ong 1958b, pp. 306­18). Hearing rather than sight had dominated the older noetic world in significant ways, even long after writing was deeply interiorized. Manuscript culture in the West remained always marginally oral. Ambrose of Milan caught the earlier mood in his Commentary on Luke (iv. 5): `Sight is often deceived, hearing serves as guarantee.' In the West through the Renaissance, the oration was the most taught of all verbal productions and remained implicitly the basic paradigm for all discourse, written as well as oral. Written material was subsidiary to hearing in ways which strike us today as bizarre. Writing served largely to recycle knowledge back into the oral world, as in medieval university disputations, in the reading of literary and other texts to groups (Crosby 1936; Ahern 1981; Nelson 1976­7), and in reading aloud even when reading to oneself. At least as late as the twelfth century in England, checking even written financial accounts was still done aurally, by having them read aloud. Clanchy (1979, pp. 215, 183) describes the practice and draws attention to the fact that it still registers in our vocabulary: even today, we speak of `auditing', that is, `hearing' account books, though what an accountant actually does today is examine them by sight. Earlier, residually oral folk could understand even figures better by listening than by looking. Manuscript cultures remained largely oral-aural even in retrieval of material preserved in texts. Manuscripts were not easy to read, by later typographic standards, and what readers found in manuscripts they tended to commit at least somewhat to memory. Relocating material in a manuscript was not always easy. Memorization was encouraged and facilitated also by the fact that in highly oral manuscript cultures, the verbalization one encountered even in written texts often continued the oral mnemonic patterning that made for ready recall. Moreover, readers commonly vocalized, read slowly aloud or sotto voce, even when reading alone, and this also helped fix matter in the memory. Well after printing was developed, auditory processing continued for some time to dominate the visible, printed text, though it was eventually eroded away by print. Auditory dominance can be seen

118 orality and literacy
strikingly in such things as early printed title pages, which often seem to us crazily erratic in the their inattention to visual word units. Sixteenth-century title pages very commonly divide even major words, including the author's name, with hyphens, presenting the first part of a word in one line in large type and the latter part in smaller type, as in the edition of Sir Thomas Elyot's The Boke Named the Gouernour published in London by Thomas Berthelet in 1534 (Figure 1 here; see Steinberg 1974, p. 154). Inconsequential words may be set in huge type faces: on the title page shown here the initial `THE' is by far the most prominent

Figure 1

print, space and closure

119

word of all. The result is often aesthetically pleasing as a visual design, but it plays havoc with our present sense of textuality. Yet this practice, not our practice, is the original practice from which our present practice has deviated. Our attitudes are the ones that have changed, and thus that need to be explained. Why does the original, presumably more `natural' procedure seem wrong to us? Because we feel the printed words before us as visual units (even though we sound them at least in the imagination when we read). Evidently, in processing text for meaning, the sixteenth century was concentrating less on the sight of the word and more on its sound than we do. All text involves sight and sound. But whereas we feel reading as a visual activity cueing in sounds for us, the early age of print still felt it as primarily a listening process, simply set in motion by sight. If you felt yourself as reader to be listening to words, what difference did it make if the visible text went its own visually aesthetic way? It will be recalled that pre-print manuscripts commonly ran words together or kept spaces between them minimal. Eventually, however, print replaced the lingering hearingdominance in the world of thought and expression with the sight-dominance which had its beginnings with writing but could not flourish with the support of writing alone. Print situates words in space more relentlessly than writing ever did. Writing moves words from the sound world to a world of visual space, but print locks words into position in this space. Control of position is everything in print. `Composing' type by hand (the original form of typesetting) consists in positioning by hand preformed letter types, which, after use, are carefully repositioned, redistributed for future use into their proper compartments in the case (capitals or `upper case' letters in the upper compartments, small or `lower case' letters in the lower compartments). Composing on the linotype consists in using a machine to position the separate matrices for individual lines so that a line of type can be cast from the properly positioned matrices. Composing on a computer terminal or wordprocesser positions electronic patterns (letters) previously programmed into the computer. Printing from `hot metal' type (that is, from cast type ­ the older process) calls for locking up the type in an absolutely rigid position in the chase, locking the chase firmly onto a press, affixing and

120 orality and literacy
clamping down the makeready, and squeezing the forme of type with great pressure onto the paper printing surface in contact with the platen. Most readers are of course not consciously aware of all this locomotion that has produced the printed text confronting them. Nevertheless, from the appearance of the printed text they pick up a sense of the word-in-space quite different from that conveyed by writing. Printed texts look machine-made, as they are. Chirographic control of space tends to be ornamental, ornate, as in calligraphy. Typographic control typically impresses more by its tidiness and inevitability: the lines perfectly regular, all justified on the right side, everything coming out even visually, and without the aid of the guidelines or ruled borders that often occur in manuscripts. This is an insistent world of cold, nonhuman, facts. `That's the way it is' ­ Walter Cronkite's television signature comes from the world of print that underlies the secondary orality of television (Ong 1971, pp. 284­303). By and large, printed texts are far easier to read than manuscript texts. The effects of the greater legibility of print are massive. The greater legibility ultimately makes for rapid, silent reading. Such reading in turn makes for a different relationship between the reader and the authorial voice in the text and calls for different styles of writing. Print involves many persons besides the author in the production of a work ­ publishers, literary agents, publishers' readers, copy editors and others. Before as well as after scrutiny by such persons, writing for print often calls for painstaking revisions by the author of an order of magnitude virtually unknown in a manuscript culture. Few lengthy prose works from manuscript cultures could pass editorial scrutiny as original works today: they are not organized for rapid assimilation from a printed page. Manuscript culture is producer-oriented, since every individual copy of a work represents great expenditure of an individual copyist's time. Medieval manuscripts are turgid with abbreviations, which favor the copyist although they inconvenience the reader. Print is consumer-oriented, since the individual copies of a work represent a much smaller investment of time: a few hours spent in producing a more readable text will immediately improve thousands upon thousands of copies. The effects of print on thought and style have yet to be assessed fully. The journal Visible Language (formerly called

print, space and closure

121

the Journal of Typographic Research) published many articles contributory to such an assessment.

SPACE AND MEANING
Writing had reconstituted the originally oral, spoken word in visual space. Print embedded the word in space more definitively. This can be seen in such developments as lists, especially alphabetic indexes, in the use of words (instead of iconographic signs) for labels, in the use of printed drawings of all sorts to convey information, and in the use of abstract typographic space to interact geometrically with printed words in a line of development that runs from Ramism to concrete poetry and to Derrida's logomachy with the (printed, typically, not simply written) text. (i) Indexes Lists begin with writing. Goody has discussed (1977, pp. 741 1 1) the use of lists in the Ugaritic script of around 1300 BC and in other early scripts. He notes (1977, pp. 87­8) that the information in the lists is abstracted from the social situation in which it had been embedded (`fattened kids', `pastured ewes', etc., with no further specifications) and also from linguistic context (normally in oral utterance nouns are not free-floating as in lists, but are embedded in sentences: rarely do we hear an oral recitation of simply a string of nouns ­ unless they are being read off a written or printed list). In this sense, lists as such have `no oral equivalent' (1977, pp. 86­7) though of course the individual written words sound in the inner ear to yield their meanings. Goody also notes the initially awkward, ad hoc way in which space was utilized in making these lists, with word-dividers to separate items from numbers, ruled lines, wedged lines, and elongated lines. Besides administrative lists, he discusses also event lists, lexical lists (words are listed in various orders, often hierarchically by meaning ­ gods, then kin of the gods, next gods' servants), and Egyptian onomastica or name-lists, which were often memorized for oral recitation. Still highly oral manuscript culture felt that having written series of things readied for oral recall was of itself intellectually improving. (Educators in the West

122 orality and literacy
until recently had the same feeling, and across the world most educators probably still do.) Writing is here once more at the service of orality. Goody's examples show the relatively sophisticated processing of verbalized material in chirographic cultures so as to make the material more immediately retrievable through its spatial organization. Lists range names of related items in the same physical, visual space. Print develops far more sophisticated use of space for visual organization and for effective retrieval. Indexes are a prime development here. Alphabetic indexes show strikingly the disengagement of words from discourse and their embedding in typographic space. Manuscripts can be alphabetically indexed. They rarely are (Daly 1967, pp. 81­90; Clanchy 1979, pp. 28­ 9, 85). Since two manuscripts of a given work, even if copied from the same dictation, almost never correspond page for page, each manuscript of a given work would normally require a separate index. Indexing was not worth the effort. Auditory recall through memorization was more economical, though not thorough-going. For visual location of materials in a manuscript text, pictorial signs were often preferred to alphabetic indexes. A favorite sign was the `paragraph', which originally meant this mark ¶, not a unit of discourse at all. When alphabetic indexes occurred, they were rare, often crude, and commonly not understood, even in thirteenth-century Europe, when sometimes an index made for one manuscript was appended without change of page numbers to another manuscript with a different pagination (Clanchy 1979, p. 144). Indexes seem to have been valued at times for their beauty and mystery rather than for their utility. In 1286, a Genoese compiler could marvel at the alphabetical catalogue he had devised as due not to his own prowess but `the grace of God working in me' (Daly 1967, p. 73). Indexing was long by first letter only ­ or, rather, by first sound: for example, in a Latin work published as late as 1506 in Rome, since in Italian and Latin as spoken by Italian-speakers the letter h is not pronounced, `Halyzones' is listed under a (discussed in Ong 1977, pp. 169­72). Here even visual retrieval functions aurally. Ioannes Ravisius Textor's Specimen epithetorum (Paris, 1518), alphabetizes `Apollo' before all other entries under a, because Textor considers it fitting that in a work concerned with poetry, the god of poetry should get top billing.

print, space and closure

123

Clearly, even in a printed alphabetic index, visual retrieval was given low priority. The personalized, oral world still could overrule processing words as things. The alphabetic index is actually a crossroads between auditory and visualist cultures. `Index' is a shortened form of the original index locorum or index locorum communium, `index of places' or `index of commonplaces'. Rhetoric had provided the various loci or `places' ­ headings, we would style them ­ under which various `arguments' could be found, headings such as cause, effect, related things, unlike things, and so on. Coming with this orally based, formulary equipment to the text, the indexer of 400 years ago simply noted on what pages in the text one or another locus was exploited, listing there the locus and the corresponding pages in the index locorum. The loci had originally been thought of as, vaguely, `places' in the mind where ideas were stored. In the printed book, these vague psychic `places' became quite physically and visibly localized. A new noetic world was shaping up, spatially organized. In this new world, the book was less like an utterance, and more like a thing. Manuscript culture had preserved a feeling for a book as a kind of utterance, an occurrence in the course of conversation, rather than as an object. Lacking title pages and often titles, a book from pre-print, manuscript culture is normally catalogued by its `incipit' (a Latin verb meaning `it begins'), or the first words of its text (referring to the Lord's Prayer as the `Our Father' is referring to it by its incipit and evinces a certain residual orality). With print, as has been seen, come title pages. Title pages are labels. They attest a feeling for the book as a kind of thing or object. Often in medieval western manuscripts, instead of a title page the text proper might be introduced by an observation to the reader, just as a conversation might start with a remark of one person to another: `Hic habes, carissime lector, librum quem scripset quidam de. . . .' (Here you have, dear reader, a book which so-and-so wrote about. . . .) The oral heritage is at work here, for, although oral cultures of course have ways of referring to stories or other traditional recitations (the stories of the Wars of Troy, the Mwindo stories, and so on), label-like titles as such are not very operational in oral cultures: Homer would hardly have begun a recitation of episodes from the Iliad by announcing `The Iliad'.

124 orality and literacy
(ii) Books, contents and labels Once print has been fairly well interiorized, a book was sensed as a kind of object which `contained' information, scientific, fictional or other, rather than, as earlier, a recorded utterance (Ong 1958b, p. 313). Each individual book in a printed edition was physically the same as another, an identical object, as manuscript books were not, even when they presented the same text. Now, with print, two copies of a given work did not merely say the same thing, they were duplicates of one another as objects. The situation invited the use of labels, and the printed book, being a lettered object, naturally took a lettered label, the title page (new with print ­ Steinberg 1974, pp. 145­8). At the same time the iconographic drive was still strong, as is seen in the highly emblematic engraved title pages that persisted through the 1660s, filled with allegorical figures and other nonverbal designs. (iii) Meaningful surface Ivins (1953, p. 31) has pointed out that, although the art of printing designs from various carved surfaces had been known for centuries, only after the development of movable letterpress type in the mid1400s were prints used systematically to convey information. Handdone technical drawings, as Ivins has shown (1953, pp. 14­16, 40­5) soon deteriorated in manuscripts because even skilled artists miss the point of an illustration they are copying unless they are supervised by an expert in the field the illustrations refer to. Otherwise, a sprig of white clover copied by a succession of artists unfamiliar with real white clover can end up looking like asparagus. Prints might have solved the problem in a manuscript culture, since print-making had been practiced for centuries for decorative purposes. Cutting an accurate printing block for white clover would have been quite feasible long before the invention of letterpress printing, and would have provided just what was needed, an `exactly repeatable visual statement'. But manuscript production was not congenial to such manufacture. Manuscripts were produced by handwriting, not from pre-existing parts. Print was congenial. The verbal text was reproduced from pre-existing parts, and so could prints be. A press could print an

print, space and closure

125

`exactly repeatable visual statement' as easily as a forme set up from type. One consequence of the new exactly repeatable visual statement was modern science. Exact observation does not begin with modern science. For ages, it has always been essential for survival among, for example, hunters and craftsmen of many sorts. What is distinctive of modern science is the conjuncture of exact observation and exact verbalization: exactly worded descriptions of carefully observed complex objects and processes. The availability of carefully made, technical prints (first woodcuts, and later even more exactly detailed metal engravings) implemented such exactly worded descriptions. Technical prints and technical verbalization reinforced and improved each other. The resulting hypervisualized noetic world was brand new. Ancient and medieval writers are simply unable to produce exactly worded descriptions of complex objects at all approximating the descriptions that appear after print and, indeed, that mature chiefly with the Age of Romanticism, that is, the age of the Industrial Revolution. Oral and residually oral verbalization directs its attention to action, not to the visual appearance of objects or scenes or persons (Fritschi 1981, pp. 65­6; cf. Havelock 1963, pp. 61­96). Vitruvius' treatise on architecture is notoriously vague. The kinds of exactitude aimed at by the long-standing rhetorical tradition were not of a visual­vocal sort. Eisenstein (1979, p. 64) suggests how difficult it is today to imagine earlier cultures where relatively few persons had ever seen a physically accurate picture of anything. The new noetic world opened by exactly repeatable visual statement and correspondingly exact verbal description of physical reality affected not just science but literature as well. No pre-Romantic prose provides the circumstantial description of landscape found in Gerard Manley Hopkins's notebooks (1937) and no pre-Romantic poetry proceeds with the close, meticulous, clinical attention to natural phenomena found, for example, in Hopkins's description of a plunging brook in Inversnaid. As much as Darwin's evolutionary biology or Michelson's physics this kind of poetry grows out of the world of print.

126 orality and literacy
(iv) Typographic space Because visual surface had become charged with imposed meaning and because print controlled not only what words were put down to form a text but also the exact situation of the words on the page and their spatial relationship to one another, the space itself on a printed sheet ­ `white space' as it is called ­ took on high significance that leads directly into the modern and post-modern world. Manuscript lists and charts, discussed by Goody (1977, pp. 74­111), can situate words in specific spatial relationships to one another, but if the spatial relationships are extremely complicated, the complications will not survive the vagaries of successive copiers. Print can reproduce with complete accuracy and in any quantity indefinitely complex lists and charts. Early in the age of print, extremely complex charts appear in the teaching of academic subjects (Ong 1958b, pp. 80, 81, 202, et passim). Typographic space works not only on the scientific and philosophic imagination, but also on the literary imagination, which shows some of the complicated ways in which typographic space is present to the psyche. George Herbert exploits typographic space to provide meaning in his `Easter Wings' and `The Altar', where the lines, of varying lengths, give the poems a visualized shape suggesting wings and an altar respectively. In manuscripts, this kind of visual structure would be only marginally viable. In Tristram Shandy (1760­7), Laurence Sterne uses typographic space with calculated whimsy, including in his book blank pages, to indicate his unwillingness to treat a subject and to invite the reader to fill in. Space here is the equivalent of silence. Much later, and with greater sophistication, Stéphane Mallarmé designs his poem `Un Coup de dés' to be set in varying fonts and sizes of type with the lines scattered calculatingly across the pages in a kind of typographical free-fall suggesting the chance that rules a throw of dice (the poem is reproduced and discussed in Bruns 1974, pp. 115­38). Mallarmé's declared objective is to `avoid narrative' and `space out' the reading of the poem so that the page, with its typographic spaces, not the line, is the unit of verse. E. E. Cummings's untitled Poem No. 276 (1968) about the grasshopper disintegrates the words of its text and scatters them unevenly about the page until at last letters come together in the final word `grasshopper' ­ all this to suggest the erratic and optically

print, space and closure

127

dizzying flight of a grasshopper until he finally reassembles himself straightforwardly on the blade of grass before us. White space is so integral to Cummings's poem that it is utterly impossible to read the poem aloud. The sounds cued in by the letters have to be present in the imagination but their presence is not simply auditory: it interacts with the visually and kinesthetically perceived space around them. Concrete poetry (Solt 1970) climaxes in a certain way the interaction of sounded words and typographic space. It presents exquisitely complicated or exquisitely uncomplicated visual displays of letters and/or words some of which can be viewed but not read aloud at all, but none of which can be appropriated without some awareness of verbal sound. Even when concrete poetry cannot be read at all, it is still not merely a picture. Concrete poetry is a minor genre, often merely gimmicky ­ a fact which makes it all the more necessary to explain the drive to produce it. Hartman (1981, p. 35) has suggested a connection between concrete poetry and Jacques Derrida's on-going logomachy with the text. The connection is certainly real and deserves more attention. Concrete poetry plays with the dialectic of the word locked into space as opposed to the sounded, oral word which can never be locked into space (every text is pretext), that is, it plays with the absolute limitations of textuality which paradoxically reveal the built-in limitations of the spoken word, too. This is Derrida's terrain, though he moves over it at his own calculated gait. Concrete poetry is not the product of writing but of typography, as has been seen. Deconstruction is tied to typography rather than, as its advocates seem often to assume, merely to writing.

MORE DIFFUSE EFFECTS
One can list without end additional effects, more or less direct, which print had on the noetic economy or the `mentality' of the West. Print eventually removed the ancient art of (orally based) rhetoric from the center of academic education. It encouraged and made possible on a large scale the quantification of knowledge, both through the use of mathematical analysis and through the use of diagrams and charts. Print eventually reduced the appeal of iconography in the management

128 orality and literacy
of knowledge, despite the fact that the early ages of print put iconographic illustrations into circulation as they had never been before. Iconographic figures are akin to the `heavy' or type characters of oral discourse and they are associated with rhetoric and with the arts of memory that oral management of knowledge needs (Yates 1966). Print produced exhaustive dictionaries and fostered the desire to legislate for `correctness' in language. This desire in great part grew out of a sense of language based on the study of Learned Latin. Learned tongues textualize the idea of language, making it seem at root something written. Print reinforces the sense of language as essentially textual. The printed text, not the written text, is the text in its fullest, paradigmatic form. Print established the climate in which dictionaries grew. From their origins in the eighteenth century until the past few decades, dictionaries of English have commonly taken as their norm for language only the usage of writers producing text for print (and not quite all of them). The usage of all others, if it deviates from this typographic usage, has been regarded as `corrupt'. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961) was the first major lexicographical work to break cleanly with this old typographical convention and to cite as sources for usage persons not writing for print ­ and of course many persons, formed in the old ideology, immediately wrote off this impressive lexicographical achievement (Dykema 1963) as a betrayal of the `true' or `pure' language. Print was also a major factor in the development of the sense of personal privacy that marks modern society. It produced books smaller and more portable than those common in a manuscript culture, setting the stage psychologically for solo reading in a quiet corner, and eventually for completely silent reading. In manuscript culture and hence in early print culture, reading had tended to be a social activity, one person reading to others in a group. As Steiner (1967, p. 383) has suggested, private reading demands a home spacious enough to provide for individual isolation and quiet. (Teachers of children from poverty areas today are acutely aware that often the major reason for poor performance is that there is nowhere in a crowded house where a boy or girl can study effectively.) Print created a new sense of the private ownership of words. Persons

print, space and closure

129

in a primary oral culture can entertain some sense of proprietary rights to a poem, but such a sense is rare and ordinarily enfeebled by the common share of lore, formulas, and themes on which everyone draws. With writing, resentment at plagiarism begins to develop. The ancient Latin poet Martial (i. 53.9) uses the word plagiarius, a torturer, plunderer, oppressor, for someone who appropriates another's writing. But there is no special Latin word with the exclusive meaning of plagiarist or plagiarism. The oral commonplace tradition was still strong. In the very early days of print, however, a royal decree or privilegium was often secured forbidding the reprinting of a printed book by others than the original publisher. Richard Pynson secured such a privilegium in 1518 from Henry VIII. In 1557 the Stationers' Company was incorporated in London to oversee authors' and printers' or printer-publishers' rights, and by the eighteenth century modern copyright laws were shaping up over western Europe. Typography had made the word into a commodity. The old communal oral world had split up into privately claimed freeholdings. The drift in human consciousness toward greater individualism had been served well by print. Of course, words were not quite private property. They were still shared property to a degree. Printed books did echo one another, willy-nilly. At the onset of the electronic age, Joyce faced up to the anxieties of influence squarely and in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake undertook to echo everybody on purpose. By removing words from the world of sound where they had first had their origin in active human interchange and relegating them definitively to visual surface, and by otherwise exploiting visual space for the management of knowledge, print encouraged human beings to think of their own interior conscious and unconscious resources as more and more thing-like, impersonal and religiously neutral. Print encouraged the mind to sense that its possessions were held in some sort of inert mental space.

PRINT AND CLOSURE: INTERTEXTUALITY
Print encourages a sense of closure, a sense that what is found in a text has been finalized, has reached a state of completion. This sense affects literary creations and it affects analytic philosophical or scientific work. Before print, writing itself encouraged some sense of noetic closure.

130 orality and literacy
By isolating thought on a written surface, detached from any interlocutor, making utterance in this sense autonomous and indifferent to attack, writing presents utterance and thought as uninvolved with all else, somehow self-contained, complete. Print in the same way situates utterance and thought on a surface disengaged from everything else, but it also goes farther in suggesting self-containment. Print encloses thought in thousands of copies of a work of exactly the same visual and physical consistency. Verbal correspondence of copies of the same printing can be checked with no resort to sound at all but simply by sight: a Hinman collator superimposed corresponding pages of two copies of a text and signal variations to the viewer with a blinking light. The printed text is supposed to represent the words of an author in definitive or `final' form. For print is comfortable only with finality. Once a letterpress forme is closed, locked up, or a photolithographic plate is made, and the sheet printed, the text does not accommodate changes (erasures, insertions) so readily as do written texts. By contrast, manuscripts, with their glosses or marginal comments (which often got worked into the text in subsequent copies) were in dialogue with the world outside their own borders. They remained closer to the give-and-take of oral expression. The readers of manuscripts are less closed off from the author, less absent, than are the readers of those writing for print. The sense of closure or completeness enforced by print is at times grossly physical. A newspaper's pages are normally all filled ­ certain kinds of printed material are called `fillers' ­ just as its lines of type are normally all justified (i.e. all exactly the same width). Print is curiously intolerant of physical incompleteness. It can convey the impression, unintentionally and subtly, but very really, that the material the text deals with is similarly complete or self-consistent. Print makes for more tightly closed verbal art forms, especially in narrative. Until print, the only linearly plotted lengthy story line was that of the drama, which from antiquity had been controlled by writing. Euripides' tragedies were texts composed in writing and then memorized verbatim to be presented orally. With print, tight plotting is extended to the lengthy narrative, in the novel from Jane Austen's time on, and reaches its peak in the detective story. These forms will be discussed in the next chapter. In literary theory, print gives rise ultimately to Formalism and the

print, space and closure

131

New Criticism, with their deep conviction that each work of verbal art is closed off in a world of its own, a `verbal icon'. Significantly, an icon is something seen, not heard. Manuscript culture felt works of verbal art to be more in touch with the oral plenum, and never very effectively distinguished between poetry and rhetoric. More will be said of Formalism and the New Criticism also in the next chapter. Print ultimately gives rise to the modern issue of intertextuality, which is so central a concern in phenomenological and critical circles today (Hawkes 1977, p. 144). Intertextuality refers to a literary and psychological commonplace: a text cannot be created simply out of lived experience. A novelist writes a novel because he or she is familiar with this kind of textual organization of experience. Manuscript culture had taken intertextuality for granted. Still tied to the commonplace tradition of the old oral world, it deliberately created texts out of other texts, borrowing, adapting, sharing the common, originally oral, formulas and themes, even though it worked them up into fresh literary forms impossible without writing. Print culture of itself has a different mindset. It tends to feel a work as `closed', set off from other works, a unit in itself. Print culture gave birth to the romantic notions of `originality' and `creativity', which set apart an individual work from other works even more, seeing its origins and meaning as independent of outside influence, at least ideally. When in the past few decades doctrines of intertextuality arose to counteract the isolationist aesthetics of a romantic print culture, they came as a kind of shock. They were all the more disquieting because modern writers, agonizingly aware of literary history and of the de facto intertextuality of their own works, are concerned that they may be producing nothing really new or fresh at all, that they maybe totally under the `influence' of others' texts. Harold Bloom's work The Anxiety of Influence (1973) treats this modern writer's anguish. Manuscript cultures had few if any anxieties about influence to plague them, and oral cultures had virtually none. Print creates a sense of closure not only in literary works but also in analytic philosophical and scientific works. With print came the catechism and the `textbook', less discursive and less disputatious than most previous presentations of a given academic subject. Catechisms and textbooks presented `facts' or their equivalents: memorizable, flat statements

132 orality and literacy
that told straightforwardly and inclusively how matters stood in a given field. By contrast, the memorable statements of oral cultures and of residually oral manuscript cultures tended to be of a proverbial sort, presenting not `facts' but rather reflections, often of a gnomic kind, inviting further reflection by the paradoxes they involved. Peter Ramus (1515­72) produced the paradigms of the textbook genre: textbooks for virtually all arts subjects (dialectic or logic, rhetoric, grammar, arithmetic, etc.) that proceeded by cold-blooded definitions and divisions leading to still further definitions and more divisions, until every last particle of the subject had been dissected and disposed of. A Ramist textbook on a given subject had no acknowledged interchange with anything outside itself. Not even any difficulties or `adversaries' appeared. A curriculum subject or `art', if presented properly according to Ramist method, involved no difficulties at all (so Ramists maintained): if you defined and divided in the proper way, everything in the art was completely self-evident and the art itself was complete and self-contained. Ramus relegated difficulties and refutations of adversaries to separate `lectures' (scholae) on dialectic, rhetoric, grammar, arithmetic, and all the rest. These lectures lay outside the selfenclosed `art'. Moreover, the material in each of the Ramist textbooks could be presented in printed dichotomized outlines or charts that showed exactly how the material was organized spatially in itself and in the mind. Every art was in itself completely separate from every other, as houses with intervening open spaces are separate from one another, though the arts were mingled in `use' ­ that is to say, in working up a given passage of discourse, one used simultaneously logic, grammar, rhetoric, and possible other arts as well (Ong 1958b, pp. 30­1, 225­69, 280). A correlative of the sense of closure fostered by print was the fixed point of view, which as Marshall McLuhan pointed out (1962, pp. 126­7, 135­6), came into being with print. With the fixed point of view, a fixed tone could now be preserved through the whole of a lengthy prose composition. The fixed point of view and fixed tone showed in one way a greater distance between writer and reader and in another way a greater tacit understanding. The writer could go his or her own way confidently (greater distance, lack of concern). There was no need to make everything a kind of Menippean satire, a mixture of

print, space and closure

133

various points of view and tone for various sensibilities. The writer could be confident that the reader would adjust (greater understanding). At this point, the `reading public' came into existence ­ a sizable clientele of readers unknown personally to the author but able to deal with certain more or less established points of view.

POST-TYPOGRAPHY: ELECTRONICS
The electronic transformation of verbal expression has both deepened the commitment of the word to space initiated by writing and intensified by print and has brought consciousness to a new age of secondary orality. Although the full relationship of the electronically processed word to the orality­literacy polarity with which this book concerns itself is too vast a subject to be considered in its totality here, some few points need to be made. Despite what is sometimes said, electronic devices are not eliminating printed books but are actually producing more of them. Electronically taped interviews produce `talked' books and articles by the thousands which would never have seen print before taping was possible. The new medium here reinforces the old, but of course transforms it because it fosters a new, self-consciously informal style, since typographic folk believe that oral exchange should normally be informal (oral folk believe it should normally be formal ­ Ong 1977, pp. 82­91). Moreover, as earlier noted, composition on computer terminals is replacing older forms of typographic composition, so that soon virtually all printing will be done in one way or another with the aid of electronic equipment. And of course information of all sorts electronically gathered and/or processed makes its way into print to swell the typographic output. Finally, the sequential processing and spatializing of the word, initiated by writing and raised to a new order of intensity by print, is further intensified by the computer, which maximizes commitment of the word to space and to (electronic) local motion and optimizes analytic sequentiality by making it virtually instantaneous. At the same time, with telephone, radio, television and various kinds of sound tape, electronic technology has brought us into the age of `secondary orality'. This new orality has striking resemblances to the

134 orality and literacy
old in its participatory mystique, its fostering of a communal sense, its concentration on the present moment, and even its use of formulas (Ong 1971, pp. 284­303; 1977, pp. 16­49, 305­41). But it is essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print, which are essential for the manufacture and operation of the equipment and for its use as well. Secondary orality is both remarkably like and remarkably unlike primary orality. Like primary orality, secondary orality has generated a strong group sense, for listening to spoken words forms hearers into a group, a true audience, just as reading written or printed texts turns individuals in on themselves. But secondary orality generates a sense for groups immeasurably larger than those of primary oral culture ­ McLuhan's `global village'. Moreover, before writing, oral folk were group-minded because no feasible alternative had presented itself. In our age of secondary orality, we are groupminded self-consciously and programmatically. The individual feels that he or she, as an individual, must be socially sensitive. Unlike members of a primary oral culture, who are turned outward because they have had little occasion to turn inward, we are turned outward because we have turned inward. In a like vein, where primary orality promotes spontaneity because the analytic reflectiveness implemented by writing is unavailable, secondary orality promotes spontaneity because through analytic reflection we have decided that spontaneity is a good thing. We plan our happenings carefully to be sure that they are thoroughly spontaneous. The contrast between oratory in the past and in today's world well highlights the contrast between primary and secondary orality. Radio and television have brought major political figures as public speakers to a larger public than was ever possible before modern electronic developments. Thus in a sense orality has come into its own more than ever before. But it is not the old orality. The old-style oratory coming from primary orality is gone forever. In the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, the combatants ­ for that is what they clearly and truly were ­ faced one another often in the scorching Illinois summer sun outdoors, before wildly responsive audiences of as many as 12,000 or 15,000 persons (at Ottawa and Freeport, Illinois, respectively ­ Sparks 1908, pp. 137­8, 189­90), speaking for an hour and a half each. The first speaker had one hour, the second an hour and a half, and the first

print, space and closure

135

another half hour of rebuttal ­ all this with no amplifying equipment. Primary orality made itself felt in the additive, redundant, carefully balanced, highly agonistic style, and the intense interplay between speaker and audience. The debaters were hoarse and physically exhausted at the end of each bout. Presidential debates on television today are completely out of this older oral world. The audience is absent, invisible, inaudible. The candidates are ensconced in tight little booths, make short presentations, and engage in crisp little conversations with each other in which any agonistic edge is deliberately kept dull. Electronic media do not tolerate a show of open antagonism. Despite their cultivated air of spontaneity, these media are totally dominated by a sense of closure which is the heritage of print: a show of hostility might break open the closure, the tight control. Candidates accommodate themselves to the psychology of the media. Genteel, literate domesticity is rampant. Only quite elderly persons today can remember what oratory was like when it was still in living contact with its primary oral roots. Others perhaps hear more oratory, or at least more talk, from major public figures than people commonly heard a century ago. But what they hear will give them very little idea of the old oratory reaching back from pre-electronic times through two millennia and far beyond, or of the oral lifestyle and oral thought structures out of which such oratory grew.

ORAL MEMORY, THE STORY LINE AND CHARACTERIZATION
THE PRIMACY OF THE STORY LINE
The shift from orality to literacy registers in many genres of verbal art ­ lyric, narrative, descriptive discourse, oratory (purely oral through chirographically organized oratory to television-styled public address), drama, philosophical and scientific works, historiography, and biography, to mention only a few. Of these, the genre most studied in terms of the orality­literacy shift has been narrative. It will be of use here to consider some of the work done on narrative to suggest some newer insights offered by orality­literacy studies. To narrative we can for present purposes assimilate drama, which, while it presents action with no narrative voice, still has a story line, as narrative does. Obviously, other developments in society besides the orality­literacy shift help determine the development of narrative over the ages ­ changing political organization, religious development, intercultural exchanges, and much else, including developments in the other verbal genres. This treatment of narrative is not intended to reduce all causality to the orality­literacy shift but only to show some of the effects which this shift produces. Narrative is everywhere a major genre of verbal art, occurring all the

oral memory, the story line and characterization

137

way from primary oral cultures into high literacy and electronic information processing. In a sense narrative is paramount among all verbal art forms because of the way it underlies so many other art forms, often even the most abstract. Human knowledge comes out of time. Behind even the abstractions of science, there lies narrative of the observations on the basis of which the abstractions have been formulated. Students in a science laboratory have to `write up' experiments, which is to say, they have to narrate what they did and what happened when they did it. From the narration, certain generalizations or abstract conclusions can be formulated. Behind proverbs and aphorisms and philosophical speculation and religious ritual lies the memory of human experience strung out in time and subject to narrative treatment. Lyric poetry implies a series of events in which the voice in the lyric is embedded or to which it is related. All of this is to say that knowledge and discourse come out of human experience and that the elemental way to process human experience verbally is to give an account of it more or less as it really comes into being and exists, embedded in the flow of time. Developing a story line is a way of dealing with this flow.

NARRATIVE AND ORAL CULTURES
Although it is found in all cultures, narrative is in certain ways more widely functional in primary oral cultures than in others. First, in a primary oral culture, as Havelock pointed out (1978a; cf. 1963), knowledge cannot be managed in elaborate, more or less scientifically abstract categories. Oral cultures cannot generate such categories, and so they use stories of human action to store, organize, and communicate much of what they know. Most, if not all, oral cultures generate quite substantial narratives or series of narratives, such as the stories of the Trojan wars among the ancient Greeks, the coyote stories among various Native American populations, the Anansi (spider) stories in Belize and other Caribbean cultures with some African heritage, the Sunjata stories of old Mali, the Mwindo stories among the Nyanga, and so on. Because of their size and complexity of scenes and actions, narratives of this sort are often the roomiest repositories of an oral culture's lore.

138 orality and literacy
Second, narrative is particularly important in primary oral cultures because it can bond a great deal of lore in relatively substantial, lengthy forms that are reasonably durable ­ which in an oral culture means forms subject to repetition. Maxims, riddles, proverbs, and the like are of course also durable, but they are usually brief. Ritual formulas, which may be lengthy, have most often specialized content. Genealogies, which can be relatively long, present only highly specialized information. Other lengthy verbal performance in a primary oral culture tends to be topical, a nonce occurrence. Thus an oration might be as substantial and lengthy as a major narrative, or a part of a narrative that would be delivered at one sitting, but an oration is not durable: it is not normally repeated. It addresses itself to a particular situation and, in the total absence of writing, disappears from the human scene for good with the situation itself. Lyric tends to be either brief or topical or both. And so with other forms. In a writing or print culture, the text physically bonds whatever it contains and makes it possible to retrieve any kind of organization of thought as a whole. In primary oral cultures, where there is no text, the narrative serves to bond thought more massively and permanently than other genres.

ORAL MEMORY AND THE STORY LINE
Narrative itself has a history. Scholes and Kellogg (1966) surveyed and schematized some of the ways in which narrative in the West has developed from some of its ancient oral origins into the present, with full attention to complex social, psychological, aesthetic, and other factors. Acknowledging the complexities of the full history of narrative, the present account will simply call attention to some salient differences that set off narrative in a totally oral cultural setting from literate narrative, with particular attention to the functioning of memory. The retention and recall of knowledge in primary oral culture, described in Chapter 3, calls for noetic structures and procedures of a sort quite unfamiliar to us and often enough scorned by us. One of the places where oral mnemonic structures and procedures manifest themselves most spectacularly is in their effect on narrative plot, which in an oral culture is not quite what we take plot typically to be. Persons from

oral memory, the story line and characterization

139

today's literate and typographic cultures are likely to think of consciously contrived narrative as typically designed in a climactic linear plot often diagramed as the well-known `Freytag's pyramid' (i.e. an upward slope, followed by a downward slope): an ascending action builds tension, rising to a climactic point, which consists often of a recognition or other incident bringing about a peripeteia or reversal of action, and which is followed by a dénouement or untying ­ for this standard climactic linear plot has been likened to the tying and untying of a knot. This is the kind of plot Aristotle finds in the drama (Poetics 1451b­1452b) ­ a significant locale for such plot, since Greek drama, though orally performed, was composed as a written text and in the West was the first verbal genre, and for centuries was the only verbal genre, to be controlled completely by writing. Ancient Greek oral narrative, the epic, was not plotted this way. In his Ars Poetica, Horace writes that the epic poet `hastens into the action and precipitates the hearer into the middle of things' (lines 148­9). Horace has chiefly in mind the epic poet's disregard for temporal sequence. The poet will report a situation and only much later explain, often in detail, how it came to be. He probably has also in mind Homer's conciseness and vigor (Brink 1971, pp. 221­2): Homer wants to get immediately to `where the action is'. However this may be, literate poets eventually interpreted Horace's in medias res as making hysteron proteron obligatory in the epic. Thus John Milton explains in the `Argument' to Book I of Paradise Lost that, after proposing `in brief the whole subject' of the poem and touching upon `the prime cause' of Adam's fall `the Poem hasts into the midst of things.' Milton's words here show that he had from the start a control of his subject and of the causes powering its action that no oral poet could command. Milton has in mind a highly organized plot, with a beginning, middle and end (Aristotle, Poetics 1450b) in a sequence corresponding temporally to that of the events he was reporting. This plot he deliberately dismembered in order to reassemble its parts in a consciously contrived anachronistic pattern. Exegesis of oral epic by literates in the past has commonly seen oral epic poets as doing this same thing, imputing to them conscious deviation from an organization which was in fact unavailable without writing. Such exegesis smacks of the same chirographic bias evident in the

140 orality and literacy
term `oral literature'. As oral performance is thought of as a variant of writing, so the oral epic plot is thought of as a variant of the plot worked out in writing for drama. Aristotle was already thinking this way in his Poetics (1447­1448a, 1451a, and elsewhere), which for obvious reasons shows a better understanding of the drama, written and acted in his own chirographic culture, than of the epic, the product of a primary oral culture long vanished. In fact, an oral culture has no experience of a lengthy, epic-size or novel-size climactic linear plot. It cannot organize even shorter narrative in the studious, relentless climactic way that readers of literature for the past 200 years have learned more and more to expect ­ and, in recent decades, self-consciously to depreciate. It hardly does justice to oral composition to describe it as varying from an organization it does not know, and cannot conceive of. The `things' that the action is supposed to start in the middle of have never, except for brief passages, been ranged in a chronological order to establish a `plot'. Horace's res is a construct of literacy. You do not find climactic linear plots readyformed in people's lives, although real lives may provide material out of which such a plot may be constructed by ruthless elimination of all but a few carefully highlighted incidents. The full story of all the events in Othello's whole life would be a complete bore. Oral poets characteristically experience difficulty in getting a song under way: Hesiod's Theogony, on the borderline between oral performance and written composition, makes three tries at the same material to get going (Peabody 1975, pp. 432­3). Oral poets commonly plunged the reader in medias res not because of any grand design, but perforce. They had no choice, no alternative. Having heard perhaps scores of singers singing hundreds of songs of variable lengths about the Trojan War, Homer had a huge repertoire of episodes to string together but, without writing, absolutely no way to organize them in strict chronological order. There was no list of the episodes nor, in the absence of writing, was there any possibility even of conceiving of such a list. If he were to try to proceed in strict chronological order, the oral poet would on any given occasion be sure to leave out one or another episode at the point where it should fit chronologically and would have to put it in later on. If, on the next occasion, he remembered to put the episode in at the right chronological order, he would be sure

oral memory, the story line and characterization

141

to leave out other episodes or get them in the wrong chronological order. Moreover, the material in an epic is not the sort of thing that would of itself readily yield a climactic linear plot. If the episodes in the Iliad or the Odyssey are rearranged in strict chronological order, the whole has a progression, but it does not have the tight climactic structure of the typical drama. Whitman's chart of the organization of the Iliad (1965) suggests boxes within boxes created by thematic recurrences, not Freytag's pyramid. What made a good epic poet was not mastery of a climactic linear plot which he deconstructed by dint of a sophisticated trick called plunging his hearer in medias res. What made a good epic poet was, among other things of course, first, tacit acceptance of the fact that episodic structure was the only way and the totally natural way of imagining and handling lengthy narrative, and, second, possession of supreme skill in managing flashbacks and other episodic techniques. Starting in `the middle of things' is not a consciously contrived ploy but the original, natural, inevitable way to proceed for an oral poet approaching a lengthy narrative (very short accounts are perhaps another thing). If we take the climactic linear plot as the paradigm of plot, the epic has no plot. Strict plot for lengthy narrative comes with writing. Why is it that lengthy climactic plot comes into being only with writing, comes into being first in the drama, where there is no narrator, and does not make its way into lengthy narrative until more than 2000 years later with the novels of the age of Jane Austen? Earlier so-called `novels' were all more or less episodic, although Mme de la Fayette's La Princesse de Clèves (1678) and a few others are less so than most. The climactic linear plot reaches a plenary form in the detective story ­ relentlessly rising tension, exquisitely tidy discovery and reversal, perfectly resolved dénouement. The detective story is generally considered to have begun in 1841 with Edgar Allan Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue. Why was all lengthy narrative before the early 1800s more or less episodic, so far as we know, all over the world (even Lady Murasaki Shikibu's otherwise precocious The Tale of Genji)? Why had no one written a tidy detective story before 1841? Some answers to these questions ­ though of course not all the answers ­ can be found

142 orality and literacy
in a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the orality­literacy shift. Berkley Peabody opened new insights into the relationship of memory and plot in his lengthy work, The Winged Word: A Study in the Technique of Ancient Greek Oral Composition as Seen Principally through Hesiod's Works and Days (1975). Peabody builds not only on the work of Parry, Lord and Havelock, and related work, but also on work of earlier Europeans such as Antoine Meillet, Theodor Bergk, Hermann Usener, and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, and upon some cybernetic and structuralist literature. He situates the psychodynamics of Greek epos in the Indo-European tradition, showing intimate connections between Greek metrics and Avestan and Indian Vedic and other Sanskrit metrics and the connections between the evolution of the hexameter line and noetic processes. This larger ambience in which Peabody situates his conclusions suggests still wider horizons beyond. Very likely, what he has to say about the place of plot and about related matters in ancient Greek narrative song will be found to apply in various ways to oral narrative in cultures around the entire world. And indeed, in his abundant notes, Peabody makes reference from time to time to Native American and other non-Indo-European traditions and practices. In part explicitly and in part by implication, Peabody brings out a certain incompatibility between linear plot (Freytag's pyramid) and oral memory, as earlier works were unable to do. He makes it clear that the true `thought' or content of ancient Greek oral epos dwells in the remembered traditional formulaic and stanzaic patterns rather than in the conscious intentions of the singer to organize or `plot' narrative in a certain remembered way (1975, pp. 172­9). `A singer effects, not a transfer of his own intentions, but a conventional realization of traditional thought for his listeners, including himself' (1975, p. 176). The singer is not conveying `information' in our ordinary sense of `a pipeline transfer' of data from singer to listener. Basically, the singer is remembering in a curiously public way ­ remembering not a memorized text, for there is no such thing, nor any verbatim succession of words, but the themes and formulas that he has heard other singers sing. He remembers these always differently, as rhapsodized or stitched together in his own way on this particular occasion for this particular audience. `Song is the remembrance of songs sung' (1975, p. 216).

oral memory, the story line and characterization

143

The oral epic (and by hypothetical extension other forms of narrative in oral cultures) has nothing to do with creative imagination in the modern sense of this term, as applied to written composition. `Our own pleasure in deliberately forming new concepts, abstractions and patterns of fancy must not be attributed to the traditional singer' (1975, p. 216). When a bard adds new material, he processes it in the traditional way. The bard is always caught in a situation not entirely under his control: these people on this occasion want him to sing (1975, p.174). (We know from present-day experience how a performer, unexpectedly pressed by a group to perform, will normally at first demur, thereby provoking renewed invitations until finally he has established a workable relationship with his audience: `All right. If you insist . . .'.) The oral song (or other narrative) is the result of interaction between the singer, the present audience, and the singer's memories of songs sung. In working with this interaction, the bard is original and creative on rather different grounds from those of the writer. Since no one had ever sung the songs of the Trojan wars, for example, in full chronological sequence, no Homer could even think of singing them that way. Bardic objectives are not framed in terms of a tight over-all plot. In modern Zaïre (then the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Candi Rureke, when asked to narrate all the stories of the Nyanga hero Mwindo, was astonished (Biebuyck and Mateene 1971, p. 14): never, he protested, had anyone performed all the Mwindo episodes in sequence. We know how this performance was elicited from Rureke. As the result of previous negotiations with Biebuyck and Mateene, he narrated all the Mwindo stories, now in prose, now in verse, with occasional choral accompaniment, before a (somewhat fluid) audience, for twelve days, as three scribes, two Nyanga and one Belgian, took down his words. This is not much like writing a novel or a poem. Each day's performance tired Rureke both psychologically and physically, and after the twelve days he was totally exhausted. Peabody's profound treatment of memory throws bright new light on many of the characteristics of orally based thought and expression earlier discussed here in Chapter 3, notably on its additive, aggregative character, its conservatism, its redundancy or copia, and its participatory economy.

144 orality and literacy
Of course, narrative has to do with the temporal sequence of events, and thus in all narrative there is some kind of story line. As the result of a sequence of events, the situation at the end is subsequent to what it was at the beginning. Nevertheless, memory, as it guides the oral poet, often has little to do with strict linear presentation of events in temporal sequence. The poet will get caught up with the description of the hero's shield and completely lose the narrative track. In our typographic and electronic culture, we find ourselves today delighted by exact correspondence between the linear order of elements in discourse and the referential order, the chronological order in the world to which the discourse refers. We like sequence in verbal reports to parallel exactly what we experience or can arrange to experience. When today narrative abandons or distorts this parallelism, as in Robbe-Grillet's Marienbad or Julio Cortázar's Rayuela, the effect is clearly self-conscious: one is aware of the absence of the normally expected parallelism. Oral narrative is not greatly concerned with exact sequential parallelism between the sequence in the narrative and the sequence in extranarrative referents. Such a parallelism becomes a major objective only when the mind interiorizes literacy. It was precociously exploited, Peabody points out, by Sappho, and it gives her poems their curious modernity as reports on temporally lived personal experience (1975, p. 221). Of course by Sappho's time (fl. c. 600 BC) writing was already structuring the Greek psyche.

CLOSURE OF PLOT: TRAVELOGUE TO DETECTIVE STORY
The effects of literacy and later of print on the plotting of narrative are too vast to treat here in full detail. But some of the more generic effects are illuminated by considering the transit to literacy from orality. As the experience of working with text as text matures, the maker of the text, now properly an `author', acquires a feeling for expression and organization notably different from that of the oral performer before a live audience. The `author' can read the stories of others in solitude, can work from notes, can even outline a story in advance of writing it. Though inspiration continues to derive from unconscious sources, the writer can subject the unconscious inspiration to far greater conscious

oral memory, the story line and characterization

145

control than the oral narrator. The writer finds his written words accessible for reconsideration, revision, and other manipulation until they are finally released to do their work. Under the author's eyes the text lays out the beginning, the middle and the end, so that the writer is encouraged to think of his work as a self-contained, discrete unit, defined by closure. Because of increased conscious control, the story line develops tighter and tighter climactic structures in place of the old oral episodic plot. The ancient Greek drama, as has earlier been noted, was the first western verbal art form to be fully controlled by writing. It was the first ­ and for centuries the only ­ genre to have typically a tight, Freytagpyramid structure. Paradoxically, although the drama was presented orally, it had been composed before presentation as a written text. It is significant that dramatic presentation lacks a narrative voice. The narrator has buried himself completely in the text, disappeared beneath the voices of his characters. A narrator in an oral culture, as has been seen, normally and naturally operated in episodic patterning, and the elimination of narrative voice appears to have been essential at first to rid the story line of such patterning. We must not forget that episodic structure was the natural way to talk out a lengthy story line if only because the experience of real life is more like a string of episodes than it is like a Freytag pyramid. Careful selectivity produces the tight pyramidal plot, and this selectivity is implemented as never before by the distance that writing establishes between expression and real life. Outside drama, in narrative as such, the original voice of the oral narrator took on various new forms when it became the silent voice of the writer, as the distancing effected by writing invited various fictionalizations of the decontextualized reader and writer (Ong 1977, pp. 53­81). But, until print appeared and eventually had its fuller effects, the voice's allegiance to episode always remained firm. Print, as has been seen, mechanically as well as psychologically locked words into space and thereby established a firmer sense of closure than writing could. The print world gave birth to the novel, which eventually made the definitive break with episodic structure, though the novel may not always have been so tightly organized in climactic form as many plays. The novelist was engaged more specifically with a text and less with auditors, imagined or real (for printed

146 orality and literacy
prose romances were often written to be read aloud). But his or her position was a bit unsettled still. The nineteenth-century novelist's recurrent `dear reader' reveals the problem of adjustment: the author still tends to feel an audience, listeners, somewhere, and must frequently recall that the story is not for listeners but for readers, each one alone in his or her own world. The addiction of Dickens and other nineteenth-century novelists to declamatory reading of selections from their novels also reveals the lingering feeling for the old oral narrator's world. An especially persistent ghost from this world was the itinerant hero, whose travels served to string episodes together and who survived through medieval romances and even through Cervantes' otherwise unbelievably precocious Don Quixote into Defoe (Robinson Crusoe was a stranded itinerant) and into Fielding's Tom Jones, Smollett's episodic narratives, and even some of Dickens, such as The Pickwick Papers. The pyramidally structured narrative, as has been seen, reaches its peak in the detective story, beginning with Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue, published in 1841. In the ideal detective story, ascending action builds relentlessly to all but unbearable tension, the climactic recognition and reversal releases the tension with explosive suddenness, and the dénouement disentangles everything totally ­ every single detail in the story turns out to have been crucial ­ and, until the climax and dénouement, effectively misleading. Chinese `detective novels', which began in the seventeenth century and matured in the eighteenth and nineteenth, share narrative materials with Poe, but never achieved Poe's climactic concision, interlarding their texts with `lengthy poems, philosophical digressions, and what not' (Gulik 1949, p. iii). Detective-story plots are deeply interior in that a full closure is commonly achieved inside the mind of one of the characters first and then diffused to the reader and the other fictional characters. Sherlock Holmes had it all figured out in his head before anyone else did, including especially the reader. This is typical of the detective story as against the simple `mystery' story, which does not have so tidy a closed organization. The `inward turn of narrative', in Kahler's term (1973), is strikingly illustrated here by contrast with the old oral narrative. The oral narrator's protagonist, distinguished typically for his external exploits, has been replaced by the interior consciousness of the typographic protagonist.

oral memory, the story line and characterization

147

Not infrequently the detective story shows some direct connection between plot and textuality. In The Gold-Bug (1843), Edgar Allan Poe not only places the key to the action inside Legrand's mind but also presents as its external equivalent a text, the written code that interprets the map locating the hidden treasure. The immediate problem that Legrand directly solves is not an existential problem (Where is the treasure?) but a textual one (How is this writing to be interpreted?). Once the textual problem is solved, everything else falls into place. And, as Thomas J. Farrell once pointed out to me, although the text is handwritten, the code in the text is largely typographic, made up not simply of letters of the alphabet but also of punctuation marks, which are minimal or nonexistent in manuscript but abundant in print. These marks are even farther from the oral world than letters of the alphabet are: though part of a text, they are unpronounceable, nonphonemic. The effect of print in maximizing the sense of isolation and closure is evident. What is inside the text and the mind is a complete unit, selfcontained in its silent inner logic. Later, varying this same theme in a kind of quasi-detective story, Henry James creates in The Aspern Papers (1888) a mysterious central character whose entire identity is bound up in a cache of his unpublished letters, which at the end of the story are incinerated, unread by the man who had dedicated his life to pursuing them to discover what sort of person Jeffrey Aspern really was. With the papers, the mystery of Aspern's person in his pursuivant's mind goes up in smoke. Textuality is incarnated in this haunting story. `The letter kills; the spirit gives life' (2 Corinthians 3:6). The very reflectiveness of writing ­ enforced by the slowness of the writing process as compared to oral delivery as well as by the isolation of the writer as compared to the oral performer ­ encourages growth of consciousness out of the unconscious. A detective-story writer is exquisitely more reflectively conscious than one of Peabody's epic narrators, as Edgar Allan Poe's own theorizing makes evident. Writing, as has been seen, is essentially a consciousness-raising activity. The tightly organized, classically plotted story both results from and encourages heightened consciousness, and this fact expresses itself symbolically when, with the arrival of the perfectly pyramidal plot in the detective story, the action is seen to be focused within the consciousness of the protagonist ­ the detective. In recent decades, as

148 orality and literacy
typographic culture has been transmuted into electronic culture, the tightly plotted story has fallen out of favor as too `easy' (that is, too fully controlled by consciousness) for author and reader. Avantgarde literature is now obliged to deplot its narratives or to obscure their plots. But deplotted stories of the electronic age are not episodic narratives. They are impressionistic and imagistic variations on the plotted stories that preceded them. Narrative plot now permanently bears the mark of writing and typography. When it structures itself in memories and echoes, suggestive of early primary oral narrative with its heavy reliance on the unconscious (Peabody 1975), it does so inevitably in a self-conscious, characteristically literate way, as in Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie or James Joyce's Ulysses.

THE `ROUND' CHARACTER, WRITING AND PRINT
The modern reader has typically understood effective `characterization' in narrative or drama as the production of the `round' character, to use E. M. Forster's term (1974, pp. 46­54), the character that `has the incalculability of life about it'. Opposed to the `round' character is the `flat' character, the type of character that never surprises the reader but, rather, delights by fulfilling expectations copiously. We know now that the type `heavy' (or `flat') character derives originally from primary oral narrative, which can provide characters of no other kind. The type character serves both to organize the story line itself and to manage the non-narrative elements that occur in narrative. Around Odysseus (or, in other cultures, Brer Rabbit or the spider Anansi) the lore concerning cleverness can be made use of, around Nestor the lore about wisdom, and so on. As discourse moves from primary orality to greater and greater chirographic and typographic control, the flat, `heavy' or type character yields to characters that grow more and more `round', that is, that perform in ways at first blush unpredictable but ultimately consistent in terms of the complex character structure and complex motivation with which the round character is endowed. Complexity of motivation and internal psychological growth with the passage of time make the round character like a `real person'. The round character that emerged out of the novel depended for its appearance upon a great many

oral memory, the story line and characterization

developments. Scholes and Kellogg (1966, pp. 165­77) suggest such influences as the interiorizing drive in the Old Testament and its intensification in Christianity, the Greek dramatic tradition, the Ovidian and Augustinian traditions of introspection, and the inwardness fostered by the medieval Celtic romances and the courtly-love tradition. But they also point out that the ramification of personal character traits was not perfected until the novel appeared with its sense of time not simply as a framework but as a constituent of human action. All these developments are inconceivable in primary oral cultures and in fact emerge in a world dominated by writing with its drive toward carefully itemized introspection and elaborately worked out analyses of inner states of soul and of their inwardly structured sequential relationships. Fuller explanation of the emergence of the `round' character must include an awareness of what writing, and later print, did to the old noetic economy. The first approximations we have of the round character are in the Greek tragedies, the first verbal genre controlled entirely by writing. These deal still with essentially public leaders rather than with the ordinary, domestic characters that can flourish in the novel, but Sophocles' Oedipus and, even more, Pentheus and Agave and Iphigenia and Orestes in Euripides' tragedies are incomparably more complex and interiorly anguished than any of Homer's characters. In orality-literacy perspectives, what we are dealing with here is the increasing interiorization of the world opened up by writing. Watt (1967, p. 75) calls attention to the `internalization of conscience' and the introspective habits that produced the feeling for human character found already in Defoe, and traces this to Defoe's Calvinist Puritan background. There is something distinctively Calvinistic in the way Defoe's introspective characters relate to the secular world. But introspection and greater and greater internalization of conscience mark the entire history of Christian asceticism, where their intensification is clearly connected with writing, from St Augustine's Confessions to the Autobiography of St Thérèse of Lisieux (1873­97). Miller and Johnson (1938, p. 461), quoted by Watt, note that `almost every literate Puritan kept some sort of journal'. The advent of print intensified the inwardness fostered by script. The age of print was immediately marked in Protestant circles by advocacy of private, individual interpretation of the Bible, and in Catholic circles was marked by the

150 orality and literacy
growth of frequent private confession of sins, and concomitantly a stress on the examination of conscience. The influence of writing and print on Christian asceticism cries for study. Writing and reading, as has been seen, are solo activities (though reading at first was often enough done communally). They engage the psyche in strenuous, interiorized, individualized thought of a sort inaccessible to oral folk. In the private worlds that they generate, the feeling for the `round' human character is born ­ deeply interiorized in motivation, powered mysteriously, but consistently, from within. First emerging in chirographically controlled ancient Greek drama, the `round' character is further developed in Shakespeare's age after the coming of print, and comes to its peak with the novel, when, after the advent of the Age of Romanticism, print is more fully interiorized (Ong 1971). Writing and print do not entirely do away with the flat character. In accordance with the principle that a new technology of the word reinforces the old while at the same time transforming it, writing cultures may in fact generate at certain points the epitome of type characters, that is, abstract characters. These occur in the morality plays of the late Middle Ages, which employ abstract virtues and vices as characters ­ type characters intensified as only writing can intensify them ­ and in the drama of the humors in the seventeenth century, which, as in Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humor or Volpone, introduce slightly fleshed out virtues and vices as characters in more complex plots. Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, and other early novelists (Watt 1967, pp. 19­21), and even at times Jane Austen, give characters names that type them: Lovelace, Heart-free, Allworthy, or Square. Late hightechnology, electronic cultures still produce type characters in regressive genres such as Westerns or in contexts of self-conscious humor (in the modern sense of this word). The Jolly Green Giant works well enough in advertising script because the anti-heroic epithet `jolly' advertises to adults that they are not to take this latterday fertility god seriously. The story of type characters and the complex ways they relate written fiction to oral tradition has not yet been told. Just as the deplotted story of the late-print or electronic age builds on classical plot and achieves its effect because of a sense that the plot is masked or missing, so in the same age the bizarrely hollowed

oral memory, the story line and characterization

151

characters that represent extreme states of consciousness, as in Kafka, Samuel Beckett or Thomas Pynchon, achieve their effects because of the contrast felt with their antecedents, the `round' characters of the classical novel. Such electronic-age characters would be inconceivable had narrative not gone through a `round' character stage. The development of the round character registers changes in consciousness that range far beyond the world of literature. Since Freud, the psychological and especially the psychoanalytic understanding of all personality structure has taken as its model something like the `round' character of fiction. Freud understands real human beings as psychologically structured like the dramatic character Oedipus, not like Achilles, and indeed like an Oedipus interpreted out of the world of nineteenth-century novels, more `round' than anything in ancient Greek literature. It would appear that the development of modern depth psychology parallels the development of the character in drama and the novel, both depending on the inward turning of the psyche produced by writing and intensified by print. Indeed, just as depth psychology looks for some obscure but highly significant deeper meaning hidden beneath the surface of ordinary life, so novelists from Jane Austen to Thackeray and Flaubert invite the reader to sense some truer meaning beneath the flawed or fraudulent surface they portray. The insights of `depth' psychology were impossible earlier for the same reasons that the fully `round' character of the nineteenth-century novel was not possible before its time. In both cases, textual organization of consciousness was required, though of course other forces were also in play ­ the movement away from the holist therapy of the `old' (pre-Pasteur) medicine and the need for a new holism, the democratization and privatization of culture (itself an effect of writing and, later, print), the rise of the so-called `nuclear' family or `family of affection' in place of the extended family organized to preserve the `line' of descent, advanced technology relating larger groups of persons more intimately to one another, and so on. But whatever these other forces behind the development of depth psychology, one major force was the new feeling for the human lifeworld and the human person occasioned by writing and print. Epithetically delineated characters do not yield well to psychoanalytic criticism, nor do characters delineated in a faculty psychology of

152 orality and literacy
competing `virtues' and `vices'. Insofar as modern psychology and the `round' character of fiction represent to present-day consciousness what human existence is like, the feeling for human existence has been processed through writing and print. This is by no means to fault the present-day feeling for human existence. Quite the contrary. The present-day phenomenological sense of existence is richer in its conscious and articulate reflection than anything that preceded it. But it is salutary to recognize that this sense depends on the technologies of writing and print, deeply interiorized, made a part of our own psychic resources. The tremendous store of historical, psychological and other knowledge which can go into sophisticated narrative and characterization today could be accumulated only through the use of writing and print (and now electronics). But these technologies of the word do not merely store what we know. They style what we know in ways which made it quite inaccessible and indeed unthinkable in an oral culture.

Preface

published in 1992 by the University of Texas Press. That work was issued in rwo volmnesI: From Counting to Cuneiform and II: A Catalog ofNear Eastern Tokensand was addressed primarily to specialists. The purpose of the present abridgment is to offer the general reader a less detailed and more affordable book. I have made no changes in tills volmne except for variations in editing, n1inor corrections, and updating a few references. How Writing Came About constitutes the first comprehensive study of Near Eastern tokens to be aimed at a general audience. Based on the analysis and interpretation of a selection of eight thousand specimens frmn 116 sites in Iran, Iraq, the Levant, and Turkey, it documents the llrunediate precursor of the cuneiform script, the world's first writing system. The material, dating from 8ooo to 3000 B.C. and mostly tmpublished before, was collected and studied firsthand in thirty musemns in fifteen countries. Also included here is my systematic study of the 200 envelopes, used to keep tokens in archives, and the 240 impressed tablets now known. These rwo types of objects illustrate the major steps in the transition from tokens to writing. The tokens from early excavations often lack a precise stratigraphy. Even so, the large assemblage presented here gives a reliable picture of the types and subtypes of the counters, their geographic and chronological distribution, their evolution over time, and the transition from tokens to writing. This book is organized into three parts, as follows.
PART ONE: THE EVIDENCE

THIS BOOK IS AN ABRIDGED version of Before Writing,

The first rwo chapters are devoted to the docun1entation of the archaeological material. Chapter r describes the counters, tl1eir shapes, markings,
and manufacture, and their evolution from "plain" to "complex" tokens.

Chapter 2 identifies the context in which the tokens were used: ilie type of settlements to which they belonged; tl1eir spacial distribution within those

Xii

settlen1ents; the structures and assemblages with which they were associated. Special attention is given to the rare tokens found in tombs. Chapter 3 describes the fourth-millennium methods for holding tokens in archives -in particular, the envelopes. The following topics are covered: discovery of the envelopes, their number, geographic distribution, chronology, and conteA1:, the assemblages of tokens they held, the markings they bore, and their role in the transmutation of tokens into writing. Chapter 4- deals with impressed tablets. After a review of the history of their discovery, their number, geographic distribution, chronology, and context, the documents and the signs they bear are described and their contribution to writing is assessed.
PART TWO: THE INTERPRETATION

The last three chapters analyze the role of tokens in the evolution of comn1unication, social structures, and cognitive skills. These interpretations are tentative. There is no doubt that some of the conclusions will have to be revised in the future, when more and better data will be available. In Chapter 5, tokens are interpreted as the second step in the development of record keeping, following Paleolithic tallies. The token was the first code to record economic data, providing the immediate background for the invention of writing. Chapter 6 shows how the econ9my determined the token system and how, in turn, the counters had an impact on society. Chapter 7 discusses the evolution of counting and its role in the invention of writing. Tokens are shown to reflect an archaic mode of "concrete counting," while writing derived from abstract counting. In the Conclusions, I smmnarize the wealth of information provided by tokens on communication, 1nathematics, economy, social stnKtures, and cognitive skills in-prehistoric Near Eastern cultures.
PART THREE: THE ARTIFACTS

The charts in Part Three provide a graphic representation of the sixteen types of tokens and their subtypes. For more information, the reader is invited to consult the complete listing of tokens and the photographic documentation in Before Writing, Volume II: A Catalog of Near Eastern Tokens.

HOW WRITING CAME ABOUT

forward. This vinv endured until the present. 5 In the following pages, I will
show how the conception of the origin of writing evolved through time.

THE MYTHS

The oldest account of the invention of writing is perhaps that of the Sumerian epic Enmerkar and the Lord ofAratta.' The poem relates how En-

merkar, the lord of Umk-Kulaba, sent an emissary to the lord of Aratta
soliciting timber, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and precious stones to rebuild the

residence of the goddess Inanna. Back and forth the messenger delivered word for word the pleas, threats, and challenges between the two lords, until the day Emnerkar's instructions were too difficult for the emissary to memorize. The lord ofKulaba promptly invented writing, tracing his message on a clay tablet: -The emissary, his mouth (being) heavy, was not able to repeat (it). -Because the emissary, his mouth (being) heavy, was not able to repeat (it), -The lord of Kulaba patted clay and wrote the message like (on a present-day) tablet- Formerly, the writing of messages on clay was not established-Now, with Utu's bringing forth the day, verily this was so, -The lord ofKulaba inscribed tl1c message like (on a present-day) tablet, this, verily, was so. 7 One might add here that, according to the Sumerian king list, Enmerkar lived about 2700 B.C., when writing had been a common practice for five hundred years. Of course this casts doubts on tl1e acmal contribution of Enmerkar to the inven~i ofWriting! In a second Smneri o n Inanna and Enki, the Transfer of the Arts of --zs;iliZ~~~-E;.idu to rech, writing is conceived as one of a hundred basic elements of civilization held by Enki, the lord of wisdom. 8 Inanna coveted the divine decrees for her city, Urulc, and set her mind to getting them. This was done when Enki, drunk, donated to her each and every one of the crafts. In Samuel Noah Kramer's words: Mter their hearts had become happy with drinks, Enki exclain1s: ... ~' ... 0 name of my power, 0 name of my power, To the bright Inanna, my daughter, I shall present ...

HOW WRITING CAME ABOUT

ers credited Adan1 as the inventor of writing. In r668, John Wilkins, one of

the founders of the Royal Society and an influential and respected English scholar, 10 commented that Adam had invented the Hebrew alphabet: "though not im1nediatcly after his creation, yet in process of time, upon his experience of their great necessity and usefulness." 17 The myths, from Sumer to Daniel Defoe, share one common characteristic: they present writing as emerging, on one day, as a full-fledged script. None of them conveys the notion of an evolution from a simple to a n1ore complex system of communication. The concept of a ready-made alphabet handed down fron1 heaven persisted until the eighteenth century.

The theory was presented in Warburton's book, Divine Legation ofMoses, published in London in 1738. 18 The ideas made their way into Dii derot and d'Ale1nbcres Encyclupidie, in the article entitled "Ecriture," which I gave them a wide diffusion." Warburton's pictographic theory remained \ practically lmchallenged for over two hundred years. For example, in the revised edition of A Study of Writing (1974), at present one of the bestknown modern scholarly publications on writing, L J. Gelb still stated: "it became clear that the Mesopotamian cuneiform writing has developed ...., from a pictographic stage." 20 --? Although the existence of ~~m had been noticed by Western trav-~ elers as early as the fifteenth century, ancient Near Eastern scripts did not play a role in the elaboration of the pictographic theory because they were still little known in 1738. In the nineteenth century, when archaeological expeditions reaped tl1e first great harvests of cuneiform texts and brought them back to Europe, the cuneiform script was regarded as conforming to Warburton's paradigm. In 1913, George A. Barton was of the opinion that "the investigator must proceed upon the hypotl1esis that Babylonian writing, like other primitive writing, originated in pictographs." The pictographic theory scheme was modified, however, to include a three-step progression frmn ideographic to phonetic writing. "Indeed/' wrote Barton, "wherever the beginnings of writing could be traced, it took the form of picture writing, so tl1at it seems safe to regard it as a working hypothesis, if not as a law, that all early systems of writing began in a series of pictographic ideographs, tlut syllabic values were developed from these and in some cases alphabetic values." 21 In fact, the idea tlut tl1e cuneiform script started with picture writing was by no means a perfect fit. In 1928, a year before the discovery of the Uruk tablets, William A. Mason noted,~~W~Jll.lJ§.~.a.~is__~~th~ _J

HOW YVRITING CAME ABOUT

linguists who have studied the origin of writing have often conferred to pictographic systen1s a value which derives from literacy." Leroi-Gourhan noted that the only true pictographic scripts were recent phenomena; that most had emerged in groups which did not have vvriting prior to contacts with travelers or colonists from literate countries. He concluded: "therefore it seems in1possible to use Eskimo or Indian pictography in order to understand the ideography of preliteratc societies." 25 Scholars began to question the idea that writing emerged as the rational decision of a group of enlightened individuals, such as that put forward by V. Gordon Childe in What Happened in History: "the priests ... have agreed upon a conventional method of recording receipts and cxpendinrres in written signs that shall be intelligible to all their colleagues and successors; they have invented writing." 26 For, like other human inventions, writing I did not come ex nihila and, in Chiera's words, "there never was a first man who could sit down and say, 'Now I am going to write.' That supreme achievement of mankind, the one which makes possible the very existence of civilization by transferring to later generations the acquisitions of the earlier ones, was the result of a slow and natural devclop1nent." 27 Above all, the pictographic theory-wasnotconsist~~'t witlimodern archaeological research. In recent years, Near Eastern excavations have focused on the beginning of agrimln1re and cities and have tried to determine how these events affected society. Viewed in the perspective of the urban phenomenon, the first "pictographic" tablets ofUmk (and for that matter the earlier impressed tablets) are out of step with other socioeconomic developments. These first documents occur in level IVa ofUrnk, lagging far behind the rise of cities and d1e emergence of the temple instirntion, which was already welltmder way some two hundred years earlier (in levels XIV). If writing emerged so late, it could not have played a role in state formation. How, then, did the Mesopotamian city-states function without record keeping? Although popular books have continued to present the traditional pictographic d1eory, 28 as early as the 1950s scholars had begun to anticipate d1e discovery of an antecedent of the Mesopotamian script. Some, like V. Gordon Childe, searched for it in ~e s-Wh!le-others looked into potter's marks, but to no avail. 29 Most, like ton ~d, foresaw an even earlier script: "The degree of competence .. ,-[attained by script of the Uruk: IV tablets] ... suggests that earlier stages in its development may eventually be recognized elsewhere, perhaps in levels corresponding to Uruk: V and VI." 30 David Diringer simply referred to "another more primitive writing" or "an at present unknown, early script, which may have been the common ancestor of [the Indus Valley Script and] also of the cuneiform and early ( Elamite writings." 31 ~se that the antecedent of writing W_!_~--~E!~_) /(1 ~~~~c!gi-'.S What had een missed-or clis1 missed- were the humble tokens that had been used for centuries and that ·'' were, I argue, the immediate precursor to writing.

What fascinated me most in this smdy was the realization that the tokenl M)'Ntcm. reflected an archaic mode of"concrete'' counting prior to the inventltlll of abstract nwnbers. There were no tokens for "r" or "ro." Instead, a particular counter was needed to account for each type of goods: jars of oil i were counted with ovoids, small measures of grain with cones, large mea- ) NUI'es of grain with spheres. Tokens were used in one-to-one correspondl'ncc: one jar of oil was shown by one ovoid, two jars of oil by two ovoids,

Studies on Tokens

Tokens ca1nc n1y way by chance. It all started in I969-I97I, when I was awarded a fellowship from the Radcliffe Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts (now the Bunting Instimte) to smdy the use of clay before pottery in the Near East. Tllls led me to systematically examine Near Eastern archaeological clay collections, dating from 8ooo to 6ooo B.C., stored in museums of the Near East, North Africa, Europe, and North America. I was looking for bits of Neolithic clay floors, hearth lining, and granaries, for bricks, beads, and figurines, and I found plenty of these. I also came across a category of artifacts that I did not expect: miniature cones, spheres, disks, tetrahedrons, cylinders, and other geometric shapes made of clay. I noted their shape, color, manufacture, and all possible characteristics. I counted them, measured them, drew sketches of them, and entered them into my files under the heading ''gemnetric objects." Later, when it became obvious that not all the artifacts were in geometric form, but smne were in the shape of animals, vessels, tools, and other commodities, the word was changed to token. I became increasingly puzzled by the tokens because, wherever I would go, whether in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey, or Israel, they were always present among the early clay assemblages. If they were so widely used, they must ( have had a useful function. I noted that thee-~~~~~¢___, ).-.F_it:f:5.Nt: a;1dthat ~hey 'Yen:.tl~S.fi~t _slay_obi<:Sts.t<:J~av~oee11 harde11_sd bL l fire.

Carletori Coon is among those who simply wondered. He jovially reported about the five cones he found at Belt Cave, Iran, as follows: "From levels n and rz cmne five mysterious conical clay objects, looking like nothing in the world but suppositories. VVhat they were used for is anyone's guess." 32 The data I collected on tokens seemed at first to be of little significance, but ultimately made it possible to recognize the importance of these arti1 1

The counters (Akkadian abnu, pl. abnati, translated "stone" by Oppenheim), the list of animals, and the explanatory cuneiform text leave no possible doubt that at Nuzi cmmters were used for accounting. Although no other example of a umeiform tablet holding cmmters has ever been encountered in Nuzi or, for that matter, in Mesopotamia or the Near East, Oppenheim made a case that abnati were commonly used in the bureaucracy. He suggested that each animal of a flock was represented by a stone held in a container. The tokens were transferred to various receptacles to keep track of changes of shepherds or pasture, when animals were shorn, and so on. He based his argrnnent on short cuneiform notes found in archives, referring to abnati "deposited," "transferred," and "removed" as follows: -These sheep are with PN; the (pertinent) stones have not been yet deposited. -Three lambs, two yow1g he-goats, the share ofPN, they are charged to his account (but) not deposited among the stones. -One ewe belonging to PN, its stone has not been removed. -Altogether 23 sheep of Silwatesup, PN brought ... their stones have not been transferred. - x ewes that have lambed, without (pertaining) stones, belonging to PN. 40 Marcel Sigrist has pointed out further texts which probably also allude to counters in the Third Dynasty ofUr, ca. zooo B.C. For instance, a tablet dealing with oxen reads: "The remaining part of the account is held in the leather pouch" (Sumerian: Kus du 10 -gan)Y

It was a leap of great ,m lt'LH '"" l'br three reasons. First, the corn1ters were revealed: they were :nLiil\111''" dny artifacts modeled in various, mostly geometric, shapes. Sectile I:! usa envelopes showed that counters held in envelopes were not 1 . .I to the literate period but extended into the time before writing iith'lltcd. Third, Amiet foresaw tlte possibility that tlte calculi were an of writing. In his words: "One might ask whetlter [tl1e scribe] ill mind the little objects tltat were enclosed in the envelopes, and tlut t'tHIVCiltionally would symbolize certain goods." 44 contribution was a tremendous step, but it revealed only one lhunc of the token system at a particular location: namely, Susa about II,C. It should be kept in mind tltat in 1966, prehistoric tokens were ktt!l\VIl and the only published parallels to the Susa envelopes were rcc:mtly excavated in Urulc 45 Six years later, in 1972, whenAmiet pubtile Susa envelopes in his Glyptique susienne, he still described the · ngs on envelopes as follows: "a series of round or long notches, similu lite ciphers featured on tablets and corresponding to the munber of 1li L'tldosed inside.

parallels between the shapes of the tokens and those of the first incised signs of writing and to establish the continuity between the two recording systems. Finally, much later, I realized the mathematical importance of the tokens as an archaic reckoning device, preceding the invention of abstract counting. I recall vividly when, in 1970, two pieces of the puzzle snapped together for n1e. In order to prepare a class lecture, I pulled from my files Amict's 1966 article, which I had not seen since I began collecting tokens. I could not believe 1ny eyes when I saw the small clay cones, spheres, and tetral1edrons illustrating the paper. Until then, I had instinctively dis1nissed the idea that the Susa artifacts could have anything to do with the tokens which had been found in Neolithic villages. Mter all, the calculi from Susa were held in envelopes and the Neolithic tokens were loose; moreover, the objects were separated by thousands of years. The next day, however, I was intrigued enough to check sc_veral excavation reports of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-millennimn sites and saw the possibility that tokens might have been used, with no discontinuity, between 8ooo and 3000 B.C. Therestwashard work. My tirst publications on tokens and their relation to writing date from 1974 to 1978,49 those on tokens and concrete counting from 1983,t0 1986.50

Wl'UN TOKENS WERE INVENTED, they were great novelties. They were

the first clay objects of the Near East and the first to be fired into :Cc>ran1ic. Their shapes also were revolutionary since, as Cyril Smith has tlC>int:ed out, they first exploited, systematically, all the basic geometric fm·tm:.' This first chapter deals with the physical aspect of the tokens, the types and subtypes, the evolution from ''plaid' to "complex" tokens, the materials of which these artifacts were made, and the technique used for their manufacture.
TYPES AND SUBTYPES

Tokens are small clay objects, modeled into the following sixteen main types: (I) cones, (2) spheres, (3) disks, (4) cylinders, (5) tetrahedrons, ( 6) ovoids, (7) quadrangles, (8) triangles, (9) biconoids, (ro) paraboloids, (n) bent coils, (I2) ovals/rhomboids, (IJ) vessels, (I4) tools, (I5) anin1als, and (I6) miscellaneous. (See the charts in Part Three below.) The tokens are further classified into subtypes according to intentional variations in size or the addition of markings. Cones, spheres, clisks, and tetriliedrons, for example, are consistently represented in two sizes, ''small" and "large." Spheres also occur in fractions such as hemispheres and three-quarter spheres. The markings consist of incised lines, notches, punches, pinched appenclices, or applique pellets. Because they were handmade, the size of the tokens varies from artifact to artifact and from site to site. The usual dimension ranges from r to 3 em across. The "large" subtypes of cones, spheres, disks, and tetrahedrons measure about 3~ 5 em.
EVOLUTION FROM PLAIN TO COMPLEX

During the first four thousand years tokens were "plain" (fig. J). The forms consisted mainly of geometric shapes, such as cones, spheres, flat and len-

crisp edges, but some arc sloppily done, exhibiting an uneven contour. The stone tokens, which required far greater skill to manufacture and a timeconsmning polishing process, usually show excellent craftsnunship. Tokens of the Neolithic period were not thoroughly baked and often reveal a black core. Scanning electron microscopy and differential thermal analysis confirmed that the firing temperature of the prehistoric tokens varied between 500° and 800° C. The fourth-millennium B.C. cotmters, on the other hand, are usually bufi:pink throughout their thiclmess, showing a perfect control ofthe firing process.
THE TOKEN COLLECTION UNDER STUDY

This study is based on 8,162 tokens consisting of 3,354 spheres, 1,457 cones, 1,095 disks, 8o6 cylinders, 278 quadrangles, 233 triangles, 220 tetrahedrons, 204 ovoids, 129 animals, 85 paraboloids, Sr vessels, 6o bent coils, 51 biconoids, 45 ovals, 33 miscellaneous, and 3I tools. The assemblage, which is fially published in Before Writing, Volume II: A Catalog ofNear Eastern Tokens, has been compiled by studying the collections in the museums where they were stored or from site reports and, ideally, by combining the two sources. The catalog suggests two observations. First, the number of tokens differs greatly from site to site. Compare, for example, tl1e largest assemblages- Jarmo 2,022, Uruk 812, Susa 783, Ganj Dareh Tepe 575, Tepe Gawra 485, Tell Ramad 380, and Tell Aswad 320- with some of tl1e smallest collections- Matarrili I, Tell Songor I, Ubaid I, and Tell Hassuna 3. Second, small token assemblages are more frequent than large ones, with as many as tl1irty collections having fewer than ten tokens. The number of counters per site does not seem to reflect particular

'l'hc large discrepancy between the number of tokens at each site has to do with the type of expedition. Excavations depend greatly upon
luck: one trench may produce nmncrous artifacts~ whereas the next is stcr~

ile. Consequently, short-term salvage projects limited to small excavated
surfaces are more vulnerable to chance than is full-scale horizontal exposure

in extensive fieldwork, as at Jarmo. This probably explains why Tell Abada, for example, produced an assemblage of fifty tokens, 4 whereas the neighboring Tell Oueili yielded fewer tl1an five tokens. Methods of excavation are also responsible for the uneven nwnbers. Tokens pose a challenge to the best excavators because of their size and color. Being small and blending in with the fill, they are particularly difficult to spot. Expeditions such as Jarmo and Ganj Dareh, where the dirt was systematically sifted, had a better chance of salvaging tokens from the excavation dwnps than those where tl1is did not occur. At all sites, the plain cylinders- which are not much bigger tl1an a grain of wheat- are probably among those which were most missed. It is very possible that spheres were indeed the most popular token shape; on tl1e other hand, they were often taken for marbles and tl1erefore had the best chance to be entered in site reports under the rubric "games." In fact, the lack of docwnentation was the major problem in compiling the token catalog. Often, the tokens are not yet published and tlms the collections available represent only a portion of me actual assemblages. This is the case, for instance, for Chagha Mish and Ganj Dareh Tepe. In early
excavations~

moreover, tokens were glossed over in the site reports. In some

cases, me lack of publication could be compensated for by studying me material stored in museums, but more often this could not be done. For example, me following statement in the Hassuna report- "pellets ... were found in considerable quantities in every level of the main sounding at Hassuna" 5 - suggests that, in fact, many tokens were collected at the site. However, there is no trace of any such artifact at the Iraq Museum, where the Hasstma material is stored, except for one clay cone and two stone spheres.

The remainder of the "considerable qnantities" of pellets can no longer be accurately docwnented. The three tokens reported for Hassw1a in the catalog are not a representative sample of the original collection. Hassuna is not the only example where the nwnber of tokens excavated does not correspond to the collections at hand. In fact, this state of affairs
is prevalent. Jemdet Nasr, for instance, is another site where, according to the report, cones were found "in great number"; yet only seven specimens are documented. 6 According toM. E. L. Mallowan, cones "were common"

at Arpachiyal1, but only twenty-four can be traced in me reserves of me British Musewn and the Iraq Musewn in Baghdad? The reports also often
communicate incorrect perceptions. For example, because the stone tokens

, were often given more attention in the publications, sometimes suggesting Hwt stone specimens were n1ore numerous than the clay ones when the t't:Vcrse was true. At Hasstma, for instance, the only specimens illustrated In the report are two stone spheres. 8 The same thing happens at the site of Amuq and especially at Tepe Gawra, where the stone tokens were published but tl1ree hundred clay specimens were dismissed.' The Ubaid report includes information on a single token, a paraboloid, described as "the tongue of an animal sculph1re." 10 In this case, it is likely that the paraboloid was deen1cd important enough to be published because its form seemed unusual and interesting, while the more inconspicuous types were ignored. As a result, Ubaid appears, probably erroneously, as a w1ique assemblage yielding a complex token but no plain ones. The large number of tokens collected at Jarmo can be explained in several ways. First, Jarmo was a long-term, extensive excavation where the dirt was systematically sifted. Perhaps more important, a member of the team, Vivian L. Broman, was studying clay artifacts. It is likely that her interest generated among the workers the necessary vigilance for finding the objects and keeping them. Furthermore, Broman wrote up her results in her thesis, malting the material available." Her study remains rmique to this day in presenting a detailed report of a token assemblage. It is obvious that, without Broman's work, we today would know as much- or, rather, as littleabout the Jarmo tokens as we do about other Neolithic token assemblages, such as that ofHassrma. The two thousand tokens excavated at Jarmo give us a tantalizing idea of the number of tokens that could be expected at each site. Jarmo was no more and no less tl1an an average farming community in the seventh and sixth millennia B.C. Its token collection should be considered, therefore, as an average Neolithic assemblage. By contrast, the 3 tokens from Hasstma and even the 812 tokens ofUruk, 783 from Susa, and 485 from Tepe Gawra are only a pale reflection of the collections that might have been recovered. The token assemblages now available give at best precarious and at worst unreliable information on the nwnber of tokens at each site and on the frequency of token types. On the other hand, the same data plotted on a map of the Near East create an awesome picture of the vast geographic expanse where the system of reckoning was used (map r).

Where Tokens Were Handled and Who Used Them

CHAPTER TWO

There is one fact which can be established: the only phenomena which, always and in all parts of the world, seems to be linked with the appearance ofwriting ... is the establishment of hierarchical societies; consisting of masters and slaves; and where one part ofthe population is made to work for the other part.
-CLAUDE LEVI -STRAUSS l

THIS CHAPTER IS DEVOTED to recounting the contexts in which tokens

have been recovered. I describe the types of settlements and stnKtures where tokens were found and the artifacts with which they were associated. Finally, I focus on the rare tokens discovered in funerary contexts because these may yield important information concerning the status of the individuals with whom they were buried.
TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS

The five sites where tokens first appeared armmd 8ooo B.C.- Tepe Asiab and Ganj Dareh E in Iran 2 and Tell Aswad, Tell Mureybet, and Cheikh Hassan in Syria 3 -were remarkably similar. All were small open-air compounds built with characteristic round huts. Among them, the two Iranian settlements were semipermanent, but Tell Mureybet, Cheikh Hassan, and Tell Aswad were fully sedentary, agricultural communities. During the seventh to fourth millem1ia B.C., tokens spread to a great diversity of habitats. In Iran, Belt Cave (inhabited during the Neolithic period) and Tula\ an encampment of nomadic herders, both yield clay counters. 4 The majority of plain tokens, however, come from sedentary villages of rectangular houses, such as Jarmo in Iraq. On the other hand, cmnplex tokens are associated with the ruins of cities having monwnental public architecture. This is the case for Uruk, in Iraq, Susa, in Iran, and Habuba Kabira, in Syria.
DISTRIBUTION WITHIN SETTLEMENTS

In most of the sites where the context of tokens was recorded, the counters were recovered partly within and partly ontside buildings. At Tell Aswad, as at other sites, a good 1nany tokens were located in vacant lots, mixed with animal bones and other debris, in what appear to be trash deposits. 5 At Sharafabad in tl1e fourth millenniwn B.c., tokens were retrieved from an

THE EVIDENCE

ancient garbage pit, where it could be determined that the counters were most often associated with early summer deposits but were rarer in layers corresponding to winter trash. Henry T. Wright noted that tokens were apparently discarded after the harvest, the traditional season for feasts. 6 Both in Utuk and in Susa tokens were found in close proximity to the main temples. In Utuk, counters were spotted all over the tell) but 719 examples (88.5%) were excavated in the sacred precinct of Eanna, 43 (5.3%) came from the Ann Ziggurat, and so (6.2%) were from the city's private quarters. It also seems significant that at Susa aln1ost every single trench opened south of the main temple generated tokens, but only a few were recovered in the northern part of the same tell of the Acropolis and in the next tell of the Ville Royale. In both cities, tokens were found in open spaces. At Ea1ma, tokens were scattered about on the grotmds of the Stone Cone Temple? and in the Great Courtyard. 8 The distribution of tokens within settlements suggests two important facts. First, in cities, tokens are more frequent in official rather than secular ,quarters. Second, the discovery of tokens among refuse in vacant lots sug1i1gests that the cotmters were discarded as soon as their function had been '\fulfilled. In other words, they were used primarily for record keeping rather ~an for reckoning. In this regard, the tokens are similar to the archaic tablets of Uruk, also consistently found in dumps, and remind us of the custom that continued in historic tllnes of routinely discarding economic tablets.'

STRUCTURES
The structures which yielded tokens fall into two categories: domestic and public. At Ali Kosh, a few tokens were retrieved from a domestic setting, where they were associated with flint tools and with ground stone mortars a11d pestles. 10 In this case, the tokens give the llnpression of having been discarded when the house was no longer in use, rather than being in situ. The same is true at Seh Gabi, where some tokens were scattered among ordinary houses- here next to a jar, 1 1 there in a hearth. 12 At TellesSawwai1, 13 Hajji Firuz, 14 and Gaz Tavila 15 the tokens were concentrated in storage areas. This was also the case at Ganj Dareh Tepe, where a large quantiry of tokens lay among cubicles situated below the houses. 16 The most interesting finding at Hajji Firuz consisted of a cluster of six cones located in a structure showing no trace of domestic activities, such as cooking or flint chipping. 17 The building also differed from the remaining houses in other ways. First, it was s1naller, consisting of a single room instead of the normal two-room unit. Second, unusual features, such as a low platform and two posts had been erected inside. 18 The structure which yielded most tokens at Hajji Firuz apparently served a special, albeit enigmatic, fi.mction. At Tell Abada, the majority of the tokens, a total of forry artifacts, sometimes kept in vessels, were recovered in Building A, the largest building excavated in the settlement.

A cache tW<!ntv-tiVe tokens was recovered in situ in the impressive complex of F, G, and H ofEanna (fig. 7). These stmctures, erected at right · arotmd a courtyard, were typical of the monumental architecture at They were bnilt according to the nsual plan, which consisted of a central hall flanked by smaller rooms, and their facades were decorated niches.

It is puzzling that tokens were located in fireplaces on occasions, at Seh Gabi and Uruk. It might be hypothesized that they · intentionally placed in the hearth in order to be baked. On the other it is also possible and perhaps more likely that they were brushed into ashes with other trash in order to be discarded. At Susa, tokens also belonged to the temple precinct, where they were ustcrc:ct in a zone devoted to workshops and warehouses. For example, uenem indicates that envelopes holding tokens were excavated in a area. 21 The stnKtures, made of clay and involving decorations made large cones, were divided into small compartments.

yielded tokens. These buildings stood out because oftheir typical Sumerian
floor plan and central courtyards. Most of these buildings produced other bureaucratic n1aterials such as seals and sealings, oblong bullae, envelopes, and ll11pressed tablets. Otherwise, flint tools, pottery, and spindle whorls seem to indicate domestic concerns. It seen1s particularly significant that

the southern city gate, which led to the temple, produced not only fifteen tokens but a cylinder seal and nw11erous oblong bullae. In sun1, tokens were often located ll1 storage facilities and warehouses. More important, there is evidence that as early as the sixth millenniun1 B.c. tokens also occur in nondmnestic architecnrre. These public buildings can take the form, over time, of a "temple" as at Untie or of a"s!rY gate as at ·.: :/~_*'-:!' Habuba Kabira.
TOKEN CLUSTERS

Tokens are frequently fonnd in groups varying from two to about one htmdred. At Gaz Tavila, thirty-five cones and one sphere were nestled togemer in the corner of a storeroom. 22 Ganj Dareh Tepe also produced many small hoards of two to thirty-seven tokens of mixed types, tightly packed together in storage cubicles. Tell Abada yielded eleven clusters of four to sixteen tokens. 23 Finally, Urnl< produced the cache of seventy-five tokens composed of spheres, large spheres, cones, tetrahedrons, and cylinders described above. Moreover, there can be little doubt that some of tl1e 155 tokens from level VI of Eanna were also clustered together. The groups of tokens recovered in the buildings ofHabuba Kabira were remarkably small. The house which yielded tl1e largest number produced twenty-one, divided into five rooms in clusters of at most nine tokens. Furthermore, except for House 2, Which held only incised ovoids, the assemblages were always composed of several types of connters. In sum, me evidence indicates mat me aCCOW1tS kept witl1 tokens dealt generally wim ramer small quantities of different kinds of commodities.
CONTAINERS HOLDING TOKENS

At Tell Abada, some tokens were held in pottery bowls or jars and omers were found on the floor. 24 In most other sites, the tokens were located on tl1e floor of tl1e buildings or storage cubicles. Because mey were clustered tightly togemer it is likely that mey had been held in a container which disintegrated in time, leaving no trace. Baskets, wooden boxes, Ieamer or textile pouches are among me possible types of receptacles which might have been used. In texts from me Third Dynasty ofUr, ca. 2000 B.C., mere is perhaps a reference to Ieamer bags being used to hold tokens. Marcel

particularly well illustrated at Mureybet. Here, the first occurrence of tokens (in level III) corresponded with a guannun jump in the quantity of cereal pollen. This implies the cultivation of grain in fields, whereas wild grains were still being gathered in the previous levels (II and I), when tokens were not yet in use. Also, Mureybet III initiated large rectangular silos to store cereals."' Finally, the settlement expanded rapidly, reflecting a
population increase. 27 Subsistence also relied upon grain consumption at

prized volcanic glass before tokens cJlne into existence. In the fourtl1 millenniwn B.c. the five sites which produced the largest

assemblages of complex tokens- Uruk and Tello in Iraq, Susa and Chogha Mish in Iran, and Habuba Kabira-Tell Ka1mas in Syria- have striltingly similar assemblages. Altl1ough the cities were separated by several hlmdred
miles, they shared the same characteristic monmnental architecture, deco-

rated with niches and clay cone mosaics." The assemblages also yielded

The seals and sealings of the five cities were alike, bearing similar motifs. They featured the bearded figure of the Mesopotamian priest-king, the socalled En, in his rypical attire consisting of a long robe in a nerlike fabric and a rmmd headdress." Finally, all five sites except Tello yielded not only envelopes holding tokens but impressed tablets as well. The various features which occur with consistency in the assemblages of sites yielding complex
tokens- the priest-king, public monumental architecture, measures, seals, and complex tokens- represent the elements of an elaborate bureaucracy.

They indicate the presence of a powerful economic institution headed by an En, who acted in public buildings decorated with mosaics and relied upon a control of goods involving seals, beveled-rim bowls, and complex tokens.

THE EVIDENCE

It is significant that the architecture decorated with cone mosaics, the beveled-rim bowls, the cylinder seals, and the motif of the En are of Mesopotamian origin but were foreign in Iran and Syria. In fact, they were hallmark features of the precinct of Eanna at Uruk. From this perspective, it may be particularly significant that the large collection of tokens in level VI was associated with the piles of clay cone mosaics nurking the first evidence for decorated public buildings at Eatma. 33 Whereas agriculture is the major comtnon denominator between sites yielding plain tokens, the cities that produced complex tokens shared the same bureaucracy, which had special ties with South Mesopotamia.
TOKENS AS FUNERARY OFFERINGS

On rare occasions, counters were associated with funerary deposits. These burials may provide information on the individuals who were utilizing tokens.

The Sites

I

From the sixth to the fourth millennia B.c., tokens were sometimes laid in burials. Among the five sites which furnished tokens in a funerary context, Tell es-Sawwan, Arpachiyah, and Tepe Gawra are located in northern Mesopotamia; 34 Tepe Guran and Hajji Firuz are in Iran. 35 The custom was practiced, therefore, in a widespread geographic area and cannot be considered a regional development.

The Burials

At each of the five sites, the munber of sepulnrres provided with tokens is very small. Ouly four out of some one hundred thirty burials excavated in Tell es-Sawwan I yielded counters. There was a single case of tokens laid as grave gifts among, respectively, the fourteen interments of Hajji Firuz, the fifty Ubaid graves of Arpachiyah, the thirty graves of Tepe Gawra XVII, and the five graves ofTcpe Gawra XL Finally, only four out of eighty tombs ofTepe Gawra X held COlmters. The total munber of burials including tokens, then, amounts to no more than a dozen. The interments provided with counters were of several types. At Hajji Firuz, tokens were mixed with the disarticulated bones of a multiple burial; 36 at Tell es-Sawwan, Arpachiyah, and Tepe Gawra XVII and XI, tokens were part of simple graves consisting of a shallow pit dug in the earth." Finally, in Tepe Gawra X, tokens were laid in elaborate tombs involving a brick or stone enclosure. 38 The various sepultures furnished with tokens belonged to adult males or children, except in the case of Hajji Firuz, where one of the four individuals of the ossuary may have been a young female. 39 It is striking that nearly all

these sepuln1res yielding tokens show some unusual features. A first group of burials is characterized by being lavishly furnished. Among them, the graves of Tell es-Sawwan had quantities of alabaster vessels and, in tvvo cases, ornaments of either dentalia shell or carnelian. 40 At Tepe Gawra, the child grave in stran1m XI was unique in holding gold ornaments. 41 In level X of Tepe Gawra, Tombs roz, no, and II4- were among the richest sepultures of the site. They included obsidian, serpentine, or electrum vessels, gold ornaments in the form of studs, beads, or rosettes, stone maceheads, and lapis lazuli seals. 42 A second group of burials was associated with uncommon architectural features. For example, at Hajji Fimz, the human bones deposited with tokens were in the small, unusual building described above. 43 The second example, Tomb I07 at Tepe Gawra, was the sepulture of an adult male who was unique in having a shrine erected upon his re1nains. 44 In this case, the burial gifts amounted to six spheres- and nothing else (fig. 8). Finally, the most puzzling burial, the grave ofTepe Gawra XVII, belonged to an individual with both legs amputated below the knee. 45 The burial at Arpachiyah

THE EVIDENCE

is the only one which yields tokens but has no other particularly striking fean1res.
The Tokens

Among the many types and subtypes of tokens, four only were recovered in sepuln1res: cones, spheres, three-quarter spheres, and miniature vessels. Among these, spheres were by far most frequently used, occurring in ten of the fourteen burials with a total number of forty-nine specimens. The fortyfour cones were distributed J.Inong only three sepultures, and three-quarter spheres and vessels were present in a single grave. As a mle, only one kind of token was usually represented in each burial. For example, three graves of Tell es-Sawwan contained spheres, but the fourth grave held a cone; 40 Tombs 107 and no of Tepe Gawra held only spheres, but the grave in level XVII held cones." Tomb 102 ofTepe Gawra, however, yielded both spheres and cones.48 Tokens laid in burials were identical in shape to those found in settlements. The only difference between tokens used as funerary offerings and those used in daily life is that the former were often made of stone instead of clay. Nine of the fourteen sepnltures were provided with stone tokens, for a total of sixty-six stone specimens against forty-one made of clay. The stone examples were usually done witl1 great care and show superb workmanship. The spheres, for example, are perfectly rmmd. There is one case at Tepe Gawra, however, when spherical colmters- referred to as ''pebbles" in the report-were left rough. 49 In another instance, six chips of red jasper were seemingly intended to be made into counters, but were never finished. 50 It is possible that tl1e color of stone selected for the manufacture of tokens was meaningful: all spheres were white with the exception of two sets of red spheres (or "pebbles") 51 and a single black specimen. 52 The munber of tokens included in each sepulture varied from a minimum of one sphere at Arpachiyal1 to a maximtun of thirty-four cones in Tepe Gawra XVII. Sets of six spheres ("pebbles") which reoccur in three out of four tombs ofTepe Gawra X, suggest that this number may have had a symbolic significance. The ritual of depositing in burials tokens of special types, material, color and, in particular, number is especially significant, since it lasted for three millennia in several regions of the Near East. Notably, as will be discussed in Chapter 6 below, this ritual gives a valuable insight into the important role of the tokens as status symbols. The fact tl1at tokens occur only in rare occasions in a funerary setting, and only in graves of prestigious individuals, points to their economic significance. It implies that the tokens were a means of controlling goods in the hands of powerful people.

The plain specimens remained a familiar fean1re in agricultural communities until the end of the system, whereas the complex ones occur only in administrative centers. Starting in the fifth millennium, tokens arc consistently found in public buildings and warehouses. When they arc in a domestic setting, the counters tend to be clustered in storage areas. The hoards of tokens found in situ range usually fron1 twelve to seventy-five artifacts, showing that both in private and public buildings the counters were never kept in large quantities. They nuy have been stored in leather pouches until the invention of the cylinder seal ushered in the invention of clay envelopes and bullae. Tokens were apparently not reused but were disposed of once the transaction they represented was concluded. There is even some evidence that the counters were discarded after the harvest. Tokens, together with other status syn1bols, were sometimes included in the burials of prestigious individuals, suggesting that they were used by members of the elite.

CHAPTER THREE

When shaking . .. [the clay balls] . .. close to the ear, one can hear the noise ofthe small objects knocking against one another inside. Specimens, broken in the course ofthe excavations, showed that they contained small terra-cotta artifacts ofvarious shapes:grains~ conesJ pyramids) pills 1 em in diameter. - R. DE MECQUENEM 1
IN THE EARLY FOURTH MILLENNIUM B.C. two methods were devised to store tokens in archives. The first consisted of tying perforated tokens with a string; the second, enclosing the counters in day envelopes. Both

techniques insured that groups of tokens representing one account could

be securely held together and that the transaction could be identified by sealings. Interest in these two devices would be esoteric if it were not for
their llnportance in the invention of writing.

STRINGS OF TOKENS
Perforated Tokens

Some tokens show a perforation throughout their thickness (fig. 9 ). The geographic and chronological distribution of these perforated artifacts suggests that they were not a general phenmnenon but were restricted to cmn-

plex token assemblages. The geographic distribution of perforated tokens is close to that of complex tokens. There are no perforated specimens in Turkey or Palestine, but some are represented in particular sites in Iraq, Iran, and Syria. Perforated tokens occur occasionally in plain token collections of the early periods, but they proliferate in the fourth millennium B.C. There are, for example, II9 perforated tokens at Umk, representing 14.7 percent of the assemblage, 189 at Susa (27 percent), and n8 at Habuba Kabira (84 percent).

Solid Bullae

The perforations apparently allowed a string or tl1ong to hold tl1e tokens of a particular transaction togetl1er. If tl1is idea is correct, we may expect that botl1 ends of the string were tied together and secured by sealings identifying tl1e account and preventing any tampering. A category of small bullae,

40

THE EVIDENCE

bearing sealings, could have served this purpose (figs. ro and TI ). The bullae are made of clay. They arc solid, modeled in an oblong or biconoid shape, measure about 7 em in length and 5 cn1 in diarneter. The bullae are covered with sealings and shmv, at both ends, the trace of the strings to \Vhich they \vcrc attached. Bullae arc generally viewed as tags tied onto bales ofn1erchandise. 1 Their interpretation as a device for holding tokens is supported by the fact that the geographic distribution of the bullae also generally coincides with that of cmnplex tokens. At Susa, 3 Chagha Mish,4 and Habuba Kabira,s for example, complex tokens and solid bullae belong to the same horizon and in the same vicinity, although there is no reference in the reports that they were found in direct association. 6 It may be significant that the greatest

Furthermore, as shown by the i1nprints at both extremities of the bullae, the strings they held were thin and could fit easily in the token perforations. Finally, their close resen1blance to the envelopes described below cannot be coincidental. The two kinds of objects are very similar in appearance: they arc 1nade of the san1e material, share the same size and, sometimes, arc modeled in the san1e oblong shapes. They also bear the same scalings, showing similar 1notifs, including lines of peaceful animals, lions in heraldic posture, and humans performing tasks. In some instances, in fact, an ll11pression of the same seal appears on both types of artifacts. For example, at Susa, a particular seal featuring a line of

THE EVIDENCE

peaceful animals and a line of felines was impressed on a solid bulla as well as on two envelopes. 7 The number of seals is also the same on solid bullae and envelopes: both have n1ostly the impression of a single seal rolled all

over their surfaces and, on occasion, two or three. In addition, a few ex-

amples of solid bullae at Susa, Habuba Kabira, Tell Brak, and Chagar Bazar
±Cature impressed markings like those borne by son1e of the envelopes, as will be described later in this chapter.s As discussed below, moreover, son1e

of the envelopes may also have involved a system of stringing tokens.
The two kinds of artifacts have two main differences, however. First, the

envelopes were hollow and the bullae were solid. Second, the envelopes
were preferred for storing plain tokens, whereas complex specimens were mostly strung. To be exact, 83.69 percent of the tokens contained in envelopes were plain and 10.57 percent were complex (5.74 percent remain un-

determined). In addition, there are more perforated tokens among complex specimens than there are among plain specimens. It should be emphasized
here, however, that there was cross-over between the two methods. Incised

ovoids, which are complex tokens, were held in envelopes from Habuba Kabira and Umk; punched cones and tetrahedrons, triangles, rectangles, paraboloids, and animals were held in envelopes from either Susa or Uruk, or from both. On the other hand, thirteen plain specimens from Uruk were perforated, as were forty-five at Habuba Kabira (including thirty-five cones) and fourteen at Susa. In sum, the envelopes and bullae are closely related in shape and function, and it is likely that they represent two alternative ways of identifying and protecting tokens to be held in archives. For reasons that we do not know, plain tokens were most often secured by envelopes and complex tokens by solid bnllac. ENVELOPES
The Artifacts

The envelopes consist of spherical or ovoid hollow clay balls measuring about 5-7 em (fig. 12). Their manufacture was simple. The cavity to hold the tokens was shaped by poking a hole into a ball of clay with the fingers, as is shown by traces of fingertips visible inside. The red color of some of the envelopes suggests that the artifacts were baked. The fact that envelopes were fired was confirmed by electron microscopy and differential thermal analysis performed on a sample from Susa 9 Like tokens, the envelopes were balced at a low temperature of about 700° C.
Geographic Distribution and Number

Five out of the eleven protoliterate sites which produced envelopes are located in Iran. These sites arc Shahdad, Tepe Yal1ya, Chagha Mish, Susa, and Farukhabad. One is in Iraq (Uruk), one in Saudi Arabia (Dharan), one

Chronology

The envelopes were in use for at least several centuries. They began being used in the Middle Umk period, about 3700~Jsoo B.c., as shown by the Famkhabad 18 and Chagha Mish examples." They persisted until ca. 26oo B.C. at Tepe Yahya.' 0 The custom of marking the artifacts started as early as Eanna VI~V, about 3500 B.c., as seen at Habuba Kabira. 21 This date is consistent with the information provided by the excavations at Susa,
where seventeen envelopes,originated in level IS 22 and one in level I7, 23 now

equated repectively to Eanna VI and V." Consequently, we know the envelopes of Susa to be contemporaneous with those ofHabuba Kabira. It is
interesting to note that some of the envelopes of level IS were inscribed, but the example of level I7 was not. 25 The markings, therefore, were not a function of time. The discovery of the Uruk clay cases in the Stone Cone Temple

area also suggests a date as early as Eanna VI~ V.
Context

The majority of the envelopes were associated with artifacts typical of Eanna VI~IV and were connected witl1 the South Mesopotamian temple bureaucracy. At Uruk, the twenty-five envelopes were found tucked in a wall in the vicinity of the Stone Cone Temple in the temple precinct of Inanna. This suggests that tbe envelopes were part of tl1e Stone Cone Temple archives and had been discarded, togetl1er with tokens, sealings,

and beveled-rim bowls, 26 once the site was abandoned and became a quarry and dumping ground. The envelopes ofSusa, like those ofUruk, came from an area close to an important temple. According to Mecquenem the area where the artit:Kts were found was occupied by buildings divided into small compartlnents, presumably temple warehouses or workshops. 27 In the more recent campaigns, seventeen envelopes with other ad1ninistrative material (including solid oblong bullae, impressed tablets, and beveled-rim bowls) came from a building smne 30 m away frmn the monmnental terrace of the ten1ple; it is highly probable that the building fulfilled some temple function." At Habuba Kabira, the two envelopes were unearthed in the largest and n1ost i111posing house of the city. It was one of several structures at the site that were laid out according to a plan familiar in South Mesopotamia but tmusualll1 Syria, with small romns organized around a central courtyard. The building produced not only the two envelopes and their contents of incised ovoids but various articles used in ach11inistration, such as seals and sealings, complex tokens, oblong solid bullae, and four impressed tablets. The Jimction of the building was certainly related in some fashion to a South Mesopotamian adn1inistration. The setting ofTepe Yahya was similar to that ofUruk, Susa, or Habuba Kabira. It too involved an administrative building, which held plain tokens, tablets, beveled-rim bowls, nose-lugged jars, seals, and sealings. 29 In this case, however, the seals and sealings were typically Elamite and the tablets bore accounts written in the Proto-Elamite script. Tepe Yal1ya shows that envelopes appeared in two settings: related either to the South Mesopotamian temple bureaucracy or the Proto-Ela1nite bureaucracy.

The envelopes have been recovered in various states of preservation. Some eighty are still intact, keeping and hiding an unknown number of tokens. Several of the pieces fDLmd whole have been subsequently opened by various methods in order to see their contents (table r). Among tl1em, four envelopes from Susa were punctured with a knife/0 whereas the specimen from Tepe Yahya was carefully cut open at one extremity. As a resnlt, the number of envelopes whose contents are known with absolute certainty atnotmts to no more tha11 five, or a mere 3 percent of the known assemblage. Other envelopes were broken in antiquity but were still associated with their full or partial contents of tokens (table z). This is tl1e case for nineteen examples from Susa, an unknown mnnber from Chagha Mish, five in Uruk, and two in Habuba Kabira. 31 At Farnlthabad, the broken envelope was separated frmn its contents, but the mark of a tetral1edron is visible on the inner wall. 32 Finally, five sets of tokens belonged to crushed envelopes (table 3). The first group comes from Urnlc and consists of fifty-two units, 33

the second from Chagha Mish yields sixty-one, 34 and finally, three from Susa held respectively fourteen, seven, and four tokens. 35 X-rays have been used, with unsatisfactory results, to investigate the contents of several specllnens from Chagha Mish, 36 Susa, 37 Dharan, and Dumal1 (table+). Because the tokens are tightly clustered, they hide one another, malcing it difficult to take an accurate count. It is impossible to decide with certainty whether a circular shape is to be interpreted as a sphere or a disk. Furthermore, X-ray photographs do not show incised or punched markings.
Tokens Enclosed in Envelopes

The total number of tokens which belonged in envelopes amounts to 3+5 (table 5). Accordingly, there is an average of 9 tokens per envelope. In reality, however, there are great discrepancies between the nrunber in each of tl1e clay cases: from 2 to r5. Ten types of tokens were found in envelopes (chart 2). The assemblage is as follows: cones 8.n percent (28 specimens), spheres 33.62 percent (n6), disks II-59 percent (+o), cylinders r6.8r percent (58), tetralledrons 13.91 percent (+8), ovoids 6.66 percent (23), rectangles .29 percent (r), triangles .87 percent (3), paraboloids 2.03 percent (7), animals r.r6 percent (+),and undetermined +-93 percent (17). There is yet no evidence tl1at biconoids, bent coils, rhomboids, vessels, and tools were stored in envelopes but, of course, tllis may be because the sample of tokens held in envelopes is so small.

Cones, spheres, and tetrahedrons are featured in nvo difi:Crent sizes, small and large; there are flat, lenticular, and high disks; there are exa111ples of incised ovoids and animals and of punched cones and tetrahedrons, bringing the number of token subtypes represented in envelopes to nineteen. Among the nineteen subtypes, twelve are plain subtypes and the remaining seven are complex. The former include cones, large cones, spheres, large spheres, flat disks, lenticular disks, high disks, cylinders, tetrahedrons, large tetrahedrons, ovoids, and rectangles. The latter consist of ptmchcd cones, punched tetrahedrons, incised ovoids, triangles, paraboloids, and two types of animal shapes. As a result, among the 345 tokens enclosed in envelopes, 287 are plain, 32 are complex, and 26 are undetermined (including the 22 tokens included in X-rayed envelopes which cannot show markings). In other words, 83.19 percent of the tokens enclosed in envelopes are plain, 9.28 percent are complex, and 7.54- percent are undetermined. The tokens enclosed in envelopes are identical in types and subtypes to those found loose. Furthermore, the tokens contained in clay cases ·also occur in different sizes: there are, for ex31nple, spheres and large spheres; they bear the same kind of markings, incised or punched. The selection is smaller, probably because the assemblage is also smaller.

pressions. As a rule, a single cylinder seal was impressed all over the artifact (fig. 13), but there are instances when two or three different seals were used. The major drawback of the envelopes was that they concealed the counters: once the tokens were enclosed, they were no longer visible. While the string of tokens could be checked at all times, it was not possible to verify the contents of an envelope without breaking it and, therefore, without tampering with the sealings. It was probably to overcome this difficulty that systems of markings were developed. The term marking is used to refer to notations on envelopes, sign for notations on tablets. Before proceeding to the description of these various markings, it should be emphasized that the total number of marked specimens arnow1ts to only nineteen specimens, or 9 percent of the total nwnber of artifacts. Envelopes bearing markings are now attested in three sites: Susa, Habuba Kabira, and Tepe Yal1ya. The rarity of envelopes bearing markings can perhaps be attributed to excavation luck; othenvise, it seems to indicate that the usage was not widespread. One method of showing what was inside the envelopes consisted of attaching a set of tokens, presumably identical to those enclosed, onto the outer surface of the case. This was done by sinlting the counters in the clay when it was still soft. This method is represented by a single fragment from Susa, displaying two plain cylinders embedded in the surface (fig. 14) .38 The fact that only one example was recovered suggests that the method was not widely used. Fourteen envelopes, including twelve at Susa 39 and two at Habuba Kabira, bore marltings impressed into their surface when the clay was still soft. In this technique, the markings were shown in one-to-one correspondence;

that is, each token enclosed was indicated by one 1nm·king on the surface of the case. For exa1nple, an envelope holding six tokens displayed six markings. This is supported by the fact that all the envelopes of this category, recovered intact, have a nun1ber of n1arkings equal to the nmnber of tokens enclosed. In other words, only broken envelopes show a discrepancy between the number of markings and the number of associated tokens. The markings indicated not only the number of tokens included but also the shape of each counter. For example, Susa Sb 194-0 yielded three lentiniIar disks and three cylinders which were shown by three circular and three long markings (fig. rs). Nine subtypes of tokens were represented in the thirteen envelopes bearing impressed markings. These include small, large, and punched cones, spheres, lenticular disks, cylinders, incised ovoids and, perhaps, parabolas and animal shapes. Examination of the markings shows that little systematization was used to depict the various tokens, except for spheres and disks. These were translated by different circular markings: the former took the shape of a deep punclil, whereas the latter was a wide, shallow depression. Cones were impressed in several ways, either in profile,40 with the tip, 41 or with the base. 42 In this last instance, the token represented was a large plmched cone, which was thus shown by a shallow circular marking of an even greater diameter than that of a lenticular disk. The cylinders appear as long wedges. The incised ovoids were shown by an oval impression with a small ridge left by the incision at the maximum diameter. There were several ways of impressing the marltings in the soft clay. The

most direct, illustrated by M II: 134 of Habuba Kabira, was to press tbe tokens against tbe surface of tbe envelope before enclosing tbem inside. There can be no doubt about this technique, because tbe incised ovoids, found associated witb tbe Habuba Kabira envelope, fit perfecdy in tbe oval cavities left in tbe clay case about fifty-five hundred years ago (fig. r6). It is tempting to speculate tbat tbe metbod of embedding actual tokens into tbe surface of envelopes led to d1e metbod of showing tbeir negative imprint. The second envelope of Habuba Kabira and most examples from Susa exhibited yet anotber metbod of conveying tbe information. In tbese cases, tbe markings were not stamped wid1 tokens but were in1pressed wid1 a stick or stylus. 43 Finally, traces of fingernails(?) on circular in1pressions of a Susa envelope suggest d1at tbey may have been done witb tbe dmmb. 44 Anotber technique consisted of marlting the envelopes when tbe clay was already dry (perhaps as an afterthought?). Consequendy, tbe markings were scratffied ratber tban impressed, malting it more difficult to render tbe shape of tbe counters. In botb specimens of this category tbe number of markings matched tbe tokens but d1eir shape did not. In tbe first example, which comes from Tepe Yal1ya, tbere is litde difference between tbree signs meant to represent two spheres and a cone (fig. 17). In tbe second specimen, from Susa, no effort was made to match tbe shapes of six spheres, which were sin1ply indicated by six strokes, whereas a large sphere and flat disk were shown, apparendy, by a circular and a triangular punch mark.45 Seven specin1ens, again from Susa, were punctured tbrough tbe thickness of tbe wall at diametrical ends. 46 The perforations have been interpreted by some as a means of preventing tbe artifacts from brealting while firing. 47 It is more likely, however, tbat tbe perforations allowed tbe passage of a string holding a nun1ber of tokens duplicating tbe set inside.

forated envelopes can be considered, therefore, as yet another possible technique for indicating the contents of envelopes. In all cases except one, the information conununicated by the markings on the envelopes pertained to the number and types of the tokens enclosed. A unique envelope of Susa, marked with a cross, shows on the X-ray photograph a yield of eight tokens!' In tl1is case, the sign apparently did not communicate the number or the shape of the tokens inside. Instead, the

infOrmation concerned, perhaps, the nature of the transaction. Alternatively, the marking could be an accountant's colophon. that many techniques were devised for showing the token contents of envelopes: ( r) attaching tokens to the smface; (2) stamping the tokens in the soft clay; (3) impressing signs with a stick or stylus; (4) pressing with the thumb; (5) scratching the clay when hard; and (6?) securing by a string. Most proved to be dead ends and disappeared. But token in1pressions and markings inscribed with a blunt stylus were carried over to the first tablets. They were the beginning of writing. Envelopes, which started as an accessory to the token system, can1e to transform it in the most unexpected way. They triggered the mutation of the threedimensional tokens into two-dimensional graphic symbols. This unique event was to have important consequences for cmnmunication.

THE SYSTEM OF MARKINGS

on clay envelopes ushered in a new phase of the token system. At first, the impressed notations were ancillary to the counters, bnt eventnally they supplanted them. This occurred when solid clay tablets bearing impressed signs replaced tbe hollow envelopes holding tokens. These impressed signs still perpetuated tbe shape of tbe tokens, but tbey assumed an entirely new function. Whereas the markings on envelopes repeated only the message encoded in the tokens held witbin, tbe signs impressed on tablets were the message. The first tablets were a decisive step in the invention of writing and amounted to a revolution in commtmication technology. This chapter deals witb the earliest tablets bearing signs in the shape of tokens. I will docmnent the number of these artifacts recovered and recount their geographic distribution (map 3), context, and chronology. I will describe tbe tablets and tbe signs they bear. Most important, I will trace the evolution from tokens to markings on envelopes and impressed signs on tablets. Finally, I will show that impressed signs are tbe immediate forerunners of the Sumerian pictographic script.
NUMBER

The total number of impressed tablets, complete or fragmentary, included in the present study a1nounts to about 240. The 1najority, some rso specimens, come from Iran. The 90 tablets from Susa have been recovered in successive excavation campaigns from 1912 to 1977. 2 Forty-two specimens were excavated in Godin Tepe, 3 Il from Sialk,' and I from Tall-iGhazir. 5 Six of an undisclosed number of impressed tablets are published for Chogha Mish. 6 The number oflraqi exanaples is about 67. Information is available on 65 impressed tablets from Uruk.' There is a single specimen from Khafaje' and a fragment from Nineveh.' There are 25 tablets from Syria, witb ro coming from Habuba Kabira, 10 IJ from Jebel Aruda, 11 I from Tell Bralc, 12 and I from Mari. 13

CONTEXT
In the sites yielding impressed tablets as well as envelopes, the two kinds of
artifacts are found in the same context. At Susa, tablets and envelopes were located in the same area of the Acropolis, in some cases in the same building and the same room and, in one instance, even in the same container. 1'1

IMPRESSED TABLETS

57

Building 2 of Habuba Kabira produced impressed tablets as well as envelopes.15 Forty tablets from Uruk belonged to the sancmary ofEanna, as did twenty-five envelopes. An additional twenty were discovered in the Anu Ziggurat, the second major sancn1ary ofUruk, where so far no envelopes have been uncovered. Several of these tablets lay in situ on the floor of the White Temple. 16 AB a rule the impressed tablets were located, like the envelopes, in temple precincts and administrative buildings. At Godin Tepe, the largest cache of tablets came from the gate house at the entrance of the compound, and a second group came from an imposing building probably used for official functions. 17

CHRONOLOGY
The impressed tablets can be divided into three closely consecntive gronps, ranging from about 3500 to JOOO B.C. The first group, dated to ca. 3500 B.C., includes the impressed tablets of Susa rS and Habuba Kabira. Some of the tablets from Eanna and Chugha Mish might also belong to the period ofUruk VI. The tablets ofSusa 17 date between 3300 and JIOO B.C. They are contemporaneous with the twenty-nine tablets of the Red Temple of Uruk and with those of the Anu Ziggurat in Urulc IVa. 18 The forty-three tablets of Godin Tepe, including one specimen bearing an incised sign, may be included in this second group, 19 together with those from Jebel Aroda, whose
carbon 14 dates cluster around 3200
B.C.

The tablets of Sialic and Tall-i-Ghazir, associated with high beveled-rim bowls (Blumentopf), Proto-Elamite sealings, and lugged jars with rope applique bands, belong to the third group, estimated to Umk III and Susa r6, or about JIOO to JOOO B.c. The seal impression on the Nineveh tablet suggests a similar date, although it has been assigned to level V, dated to 29002500 B.c. 21

The chronology of the impressed tablet is important because it clearly demonstrates that impressed signs preceded pictography by an interval of
about two hundred years, or some eight generations. There are no picto-

graphic texts contemporaneous with the earliest group of impressed tablets from Susa r8 and Urulc VI-IVc. The earliest evidence of pictography consists of a group of tablets recovered on the floor of Temple C, in Uruk Oc XVI 3: "On the floor, uuder the collapsed roof of Temple C's T-shaped
hall, in level IVa." These seven tablets may be as early as Uruk Nb 22 or as

late as IVa. 23 Consequently, it is about

of the second group of impressed tablets, that the two kinds of writing began to coexist. This is illustrated at Godin Tepe 24 and at Sialk, where the two types of tablets were found together. 25

DESCRIPTION

All the in1pressed tablets were made of clay, except for twenty-two plaster specimens recovered in the Anu Ziggurat ofUruk. 26 The tablets are small, fitting comfortably in the palm of the hand. On average, they are about 5 em wide, 4 em long, and 2 em thick. They are modeled in various shapes, with the lack of standardization typical of a new craft. A number are oval, some r0lmdish, others square or rectangular. The profile of the tablets is also highly variable, and while most specimens are convex, some are flat and still others are plano-convex. Many of these documents were authenticated by seals. The seal impressions cover the impressed signs, showing that the tablets were first inscribed and then sealed.

THE SIGNS

For the salce of clarity, I call the notations on tablets signs, whereas those on envelopes are referred to as markings. Seventeen signs can be identified on the impressed tablets.

The Layout

Most tablets are inscribed on tbe obverse only, but some bear additional notations on the reverse or along the edges. 27 In the latter two cases~ each face presents a separate account~ and in no instance does the reverse indicate a total, as is tbe case in later pictographic tablets. Some tablets were turned like tbe page of a book to read the second face, 28 but otbers were turned on a horizontal axis. 29 The signs are normally organized in horizontal lines parallel to tbe longer side of tbe tablet. Signs of clifferent types are usually not mixed within the same line. Instead~ each line consists of identical signs. For example, a line of circular signs is followed by a line of wedges (fig. 18). When there are only a few signs in a line, tbey are placed in the center, rather tban to tbe side. The signs are by no means randomly aligned but are organized in hierarchical order. The largest units, placed at the top of tbe tablets, are followed by lines of signs of decreasing value. For example, a line of circular signs standing for large measures of grain precedes a line of wedges, which, as will be shown later, represented smaller units of grain (fig. 18). Because each line consisted of series of identical signs, tbe tablets could

62

THE EVIDENCE

be read in any direction. Several specimens indicate, however, that writing usually proceeded from top to bottom and from right to left and perhaps continued in the opposite direction (boustrophedon). Among these examples, a tablet from Godin Tepe has a complete line of signs in the upper part of the tablet and the two last units are added below (fig. 24 ). 30 Sb 2313 from Susa illustrates how, on the few occasions when a line is composed of different signs, the larger units were at the right, followed by lesser units toward the left. Since the scribes placed the signs in hierarchical order, starting with the largest units, we may logically deduce that the signs on the right were written before those on the left (fig. 19). Finally, tablet 73-292 of Godin Tcpe has a line starting from the right and a second line starting from the left, or boustrophedon (fig. 24). 31
The Technique of Impression

The techniques for impressing signs on tablets were the same as those used for envelopes. Signs were still made by pressing tokens against the surface of the tablets. This is visibly the case for Sb 2313 of Susa (fig. 19 ), which bears three large wedges showing distinctly the entire outline of the cone used for impressing them. The signs corresponding to pinched spheres, biconoids, ovoids, and triangles had to be impressed with tokens since no stylus could have achieved such shapes. In other cases, circular signs and wedges were impressed with a blw1t stylus. Some signs can be described as representing a mixed impressed/incised technique (signs 2d and 6b above). On Sb 1975 bis from Susa, a token triangle was impressed four times on the face of the tablet, and each of these triangular impressions was completed by a vertical incision performed with a pointed stylus (fig. 22), reproducing a triangle with an incised line (type 8: n).

The Evolution from Tokens to Signs

Each of the seventeen impressed signs can be traced to a token prototype. Considering the limited sampling of nineteen marked envelopes and 240 tablets 1 it is remarkable that in seven instances the develop1nent fron1 tokens to markings on envelopes and signs on tablets can be fully documented. The relevant infonnation will be presented below, as fOllows:

THE EVIDENCE

BEYOND THE IMPRESSED TABLETS: PICTOGRAPHY

The docun1entation presented above shows that the impressed tablets represented only a transitional phase of writing leading to pictography- in this case, the graphic representation of tokens. The chart on pages 69-70 illustrates how son1e of the impressed signs were supplanted by pictographs traced with a sharp stylus. For example, oval and triangular signs evolved into incised pictographs, while still other signs bccan1e impressed/incised. On the other hand, wedges and circular signs remained impressed, creating a dichotomy bcnveen two kinds of scripts: impressed and pictographic. In the following section, I will discuss how the en1ergence of two different scripts may be explained by the two kinds of prototypes: plain and complex tokens.

The Tokens as Prototypes of Impressed Signs

The most common types of tokens, which pervaded the entire Near Eastcones, spheres, disks, and cylinders- gave rise to the most common in1-

pressed signs. These counters, including punched cones and spheres, are also among the most ancient token shapes, occurring among the earliest
assemblages of Tepe Asiab and Ganj Dareh Tepe and persisting witbout discontinuity until the fourth millennium B.C. Perhaps most significant, cones, punched cones, spheres, disks, and cylinders are among the subtypes most frequently held in envelopes and, subsequently, most commonly translated into impressed markings on tbe surface of envelopes. This suggests tlut tbe fashion in which tokens were kept in archives detennined the resulting script. Sign impression was the most ancient and also the most rudimentary of tbe two early forms of writing. The major drawback of tbe impressed techtuque was tl1e blurring of the shapes of tbe token prototypes. For example, tokens of distinctive forms- such as cones and cylinders, or disks and spheres- were transcribed, respectively, into closely related wedges or circular signs. As a result, tbe signs were identified by context ratber tl1an by shape. Thus, short and long wedges representing cones and cylinders were distinguished by tbeir position on tl1e tablet: tbe long wedges were systematically placed near the edge of a tablet, 136 whereas rl1e short wedges were traced at the center of the field. 137 The circular signs deriving from spheres and lenticular disks could be set apart by their association witb otber signs. Those standing for spheres were combined with short wedges,' 38 tbose representing lenticular disks were combined witb long wedges. 139

The Tokens as Prototypes of Impressed/Incised Signs

Notched spheres (type 2: 7) 140 and incised triangles (type 8: n) were tbe prototypes for impressed/incised signs. These signs are very important because tbey attest to tl1e close relationsllip between impressed and incised signs. They show, beyond any donbt, tl1at tbe incised pictographs came

as the third and final step of the evolution from tokens to writing. The incised triangle is of particular interest since one can trace it through the following four stages of evolution: (1) complex token, (2) impressed sign, (3) impressed/incised sign, and (4-) pictograph. Although the incised triangles were among the more frequent subtypes of fourth-millennium complex tokens, none so tar has been found enclosed in an envelope. ln1pressions of incised triangles occur on the ''solid clay ball" of Susa. 141 The impressed/incised sign that followed consisted in complementing a triangular token impression with an incised marking (fig. 22).'" Finally came the pictograph ATU 900.

Four more impressed signs/markings evolved into incised pictographs. The technique was not new: tokens had been marked by incised lines as early as the beginning of the system in the eighth millennium B.c., and incised markings became especially important with the complex tokens of the fourth millennium. However, the use of a stylus to trace signs on a tablet followed the impressed script, constimting a third stage in the evolution of writing in the Near East (after markings on envelopes and impressed signs). The resulting incised signs had the advantage of being far more legible than those which were impressed. The incised signs represented with greater accuracy the profile of the token prototypes, as well as the marltings displayed on their surface. This was an important feature because the pictographs derived mosrly from complex tokens characterized by linear marltings. Among the impressed markings which evolved into pictographs, the incised ovoids (type 6: 14-) are most important because rl1ey can be traced at each of the four steps of the evolution. First, incised ovoids were among the 1nost common complex tokens in fourth-millennium sites; second, they were held in unmarked envelopes at Uruk; 143 third, rl1ey appear as impressed markings on an envelope from Habuba Kabira; 144 and fourth, rl1ey become the incised pictograph ATU 733/ZATU 293. There is, however, no known corresponding impressed sign. The rl1ree remaining token subtypes perpetuated both by impressed signs and pictographs include pinched spheres (type 2: 15), plain ovoids (type 6: r), and plain triangles (type 8: 2). These tokens can be matched to ATU 781/ZATU 24-o, 145 ATU 732/ZATU 280, 709, and ATU 4-28/ZATU 254-. All these tokens are typically complex and, except for the plain ovoids, are never part of assemblages prior to the middle of the fourth millennmmB.C. The last and most important category of complex tokens that contributed to the Sumerian pictographic script has thus far not been identified in envelopes. That is perhaps because so few envelopes are known, but more likely it is because, as I have discussed in the previous chapter, complex tokens were often perforated and therefore were probably attached by a string when they were held in archives. Their listing includes rl1e examples in rl1e chart on pages 72-78.

Comment: The meaning of tetrahedrons remains enigmatic. They are among the plain tokens which arc both consistently found at large and most frequently included in envelopes. It is to be expected, therefOre, that they vvcre perpetuated in writing. However, none of the envelopes that hold tetrahedrons bears i1npressed markings; nor do we yet have an impressed tablet with triangular i1npressions. It is possible that the tetrahedron represented a docket or unit of work. 159 The tetrahedron correlates with the two triangular signs ATU 403/ZATU 659, identified by Rene Labat as !agar ("temple servant"), 100 or to ATU 526/ZATU z8o, KAK (du3), traditionally interpreted as "1nake, build.'' Clay dockets in the shape of tetrahedrons were used, for example, at Sip par in the third and second millennia B.C."' The date and name of individuals written on the dockets malce it clear that the objects were 1neant to be exchanged against rations of barley as wages. Perhaps these late dockets perpetuated both the shape and the meaning of the prehistoric tokens. This idea seems plausible, for manpower was an iinportant co111111odity of exchange in the ancient Near East. This is attested by the numerous texts referring to workmen digging canals, constructing buildings, and harvesting fields. If the tetral1edrons truly represent a lmit of work, it wonld be logical to assume that the various sizes of the tokens expressed time units such as one day's work (or one week's or one month's), unless they referred to different salary rates according to the size of a team or the kind of labor.
IN SUM, certain tokens, mostly plain, were perpetuated by in1pressed signs while otl1ers, mostly complex, were transcribed into incised pictographs. It is evident that complex tokens, characterized by multiple markings, did not lend the1nselves to being i1npressed and were more conveniently translated by signs traced with a stylus. However, tl1e reason why two different styles of script developed may lie in the way tokens were handled in various offices. Cones, plmched cones, spheres, disks, and cylinders were mostly kept in envelopes- and tl1erefore carne to be translated by impressed markings. On the other hand, complex tokens were perforated and strung and thns were never transcribed into impressed markings. In turn, the different ways of keeping tokens in archives may be explained by the sort of goods each type of token represented. The plain tokens represented products of the far1n and the countryside, whereas complex tokens stood for goods manufactured in the city. It is therefore logical to assnme that the two types of tokens were handled by different hands in different offices. It is noteworthy that the incised ovoids were exceptional in being sometimes kept in envelopes and sometimes perforated in order to be strung. At Untie, for example, in tl1e collection of tl1irty incised ovoids, ten were held in envelopes (fig. rz) ' 62 and five 163 were perforated. This may explain why the incised ovoids were transcribed both into impressed and incised signs.

THE EVIDENCE

THE MEANING OF SIGNS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING TOKENS

The key to understanding the meaning of pictographs, impressed markings and, ulti1nately., tokens lies in the ctmeiform script of the third millennium B.C. Assyriologists can, in some instances., trace the evolution of cuneiform characters backward through more and more archaic forms to their prototypes in the late fourth millennium B.C. The interpretation of pictographs and impressed signs proposed here is the outcome of such research by A. Falkenstein, M. W. Green, S. Langdon, K. Szarzynska, and A. A. Vaiman, all of whom assun1ed that, logically, the original signs carried the sJ111e meaning as the derived cuneiform signs. In nwn, it is logical to trust that the impressed signs perpetuated the meaning of their token prototypes.

Impressed Signs

Plain Cones, Spheres, and Flat Disks: Metrological Units of Grain(?)
Thureau Dangin in 1932 had inferred that the impressed wedges and circular signs stood for metrological units used specifically for grain. 164 This is also the outcome of more recent work by A. A. Vaiman, Joran Friberg, and Hans J. Nissen, Peter Damerov, and Robert K. Engllmd. '" Friberg proposed that the short wedge represented a unit of grain, possibly the ban, the most basic Sumerian measure of cereal, which was equivalent to about 6 liters of grain. According to Friberg, a unit six times larger, the bari!Ja,' was represented by a circular marking. ' 66 It appears that the shapes of the signs for grain metrology derive from tokens in the shape of cones and spheres. The small cone apparently represented a small w1it of grain in common use. Moreover, the sphere is to be understood as a second, larger, basic unit of grain. Large cones and spheres represent still larger wlits of grain metrology. According to Friberg, the large wedge, which would correspond to the large cone, was equivalent to 180 ban of barley. The wedges shmvn sideways or apex to apex were fractions of a ban. Furthermore, it appears to be meaningful that in the four instances when flat disks were included in envelopes, they were associated with small spheres 167 or with small and large spheres. 168 The association of spheres and flat disks in envelopes seems to correspond with the frequent association of deep and shallow circular impressed signs on tablets. I therefore propose the possibility that spheres, large spheres, and flat disks represent a sequence of three measures of grain corresponding respectively to such later Sumerian wlits as 1, 10, and (?) bariga. These three circular signs could correspond to ATU 897, 913, and 907. It should be assumed, however, that during prehistory, cones, spheres, and disks represented nonstandarclized measures of grain. They referred probably to containers in which the goods were traditionally handled, such as a "small basket," a "large basket," or a ~'granary." These units might be compared to such present-day infonnal measures as a "cup of sugar" and a

''pitcher of beer." As a result, the prehistoric units should be assumed to be entirely nonmathematical entities. Until the late fourth mille1mium B.C., a sphere cannot be considered as a precise multiple/fraction of a cone or disk. The n1easure.·.; probably did not become standardized n1etrological units before the late Uruk period or the early historical period, when their ratio was as follows:

The similarity of shape between counters indicating grain and land measures may, in turn, point to a cmnmon practice in early societies of calculating land measurements in tenns of the quantity of seed necessary for sowing. 170 The tokens indicating milts ofland carmot be considered to have represented standardized measures during prehistory. It is only in the late fourth or early third millennium B.C. that they became increments of a specific ratio, as follows:

The Cylinders and Lenticular Disks: Units for Animal Counts(?) Joran Friberg identified a special accounting system used to keep track of animals in Elan1 that was also used in U ruk. 171 These signs consisted of a long wedge, which I propose to view as the rendering of a cylinder (type 4: 1), to represent one animal. Tlus assumption is supported by an envelope from Susa, Sb 1940, which bears three long wedges on its surface, corresponding to three cylinders held inside. m According to Friberg, the sign for ten an.i1nals was a circle, which I interpret as the graphic representation of a lenticular disk (type 3: w). This is also supported by the Susa envelope Sb 1940, which held three lenticular disks translated into three circular markings on its face. 173 If this interpre-

tation is correct, the lenticular disk is a unique cxan1ple of a token expressing a group. I assume that the prototype lenticular disk 1neant a "flock." Only in the late fourth or early third millennium can the impressed circular sign be identified as standing for a precise nun1ber: "ten animals." Cylinders as well as lenticular disks, it seems, were used to count animals, with no specification of age and sex. Because sheep and goats \Verc so con1mon in Mesopotamia and Elan1, it is probable that the animals in question were mostly small livestock.

ANIMALS
~---o--x
The plain tokens, which were both the most cmnmon and the most ancient counters, stood tOr quantities of staple foods- grain and livestockand for measures ofland. They gave rise to parallel sequences of impressed signs, the first being metrological units of cereals, the second standing for numbers of animals, and the third representing area of land. The tokens/ signs of these three sequences are not often combined in a single envelope or on the same tablet. In one instance, however, lenticular disks were associated with cones in an envelope from Susa. 174 This particular account stood, perhaps, for quantities of fodder allotted to a munber of animals. In stun, the meaning of the fourth-millennium plain tokens can be extrapolated backward from the impressed signs of the fourth to the third millennia B.C. But what about the cones, spheres, disks, and cylinders extracted from the prehistoric layers of the eighth to the fifth millennia B.C.? Can one assume that they held the same significance as those of the fourth millennium? There is no way to know. The only clue they might hold is the fact that signs and symbols have a pervasive endurance which makes them withstand time in a unique fashion. This is exemplified, for example, by our symbols for numerals- r, 2, 3, etc.- which have remained practically unchanged since their inception in 700 B. c. Mter all, symbols are instituted for the purpose of communication, and any deviation- in their use would create miscommlmication and confusion. Disjunction in S)llnbolism, as argued by Terence Grieder, occurs only as a result of drastic social or environmental change. 175 No such upheaval is known to have occurred between the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic period in the Near East. On the contrary, that time is known as a cultural plateau characterized by a great stability. Another vexing proble1n concerns whether or not cones, spheres, disks, and cylinders carried the same meaning from the Mediterranean coast to the Caspian Sea. While the question cannot be answered, several arguments offer support for the idea that they did. First, it is easier to borrow than to reinvent. Second, the cones, spheres, disks, and cylinders were among the easiest shapes to make and, according to the law of least effort, represented the most common staples: grain and animals. Now, cultivated grain and

The tokens identified by pictographs likewise stood for units of merchandise, leading to the conclusion that during its entire existence the token system was an accounting device restricted to keeping track of goods. Some of the complex tokens were used to keep accounts of animals and quantities of grain. They differed from the plain tokens, however, in showing greater precision. Cylinders and lenticular disks represented so many head of livestock but the complex counters indicated the species ("fat-tailed sheep," type z: I5), the sex ("ewe," type 3' 54), and the age ("lamb," type 3' I4). The quannun jump in the number of token types and subtypes which occurred in large cities about 3500 B.c. seems to reflect a need for greater accuracy. On the other hand, most of the complex tokens found in the large centers of the fourth millennium B.C. stood for finished products, such as bread, oil, perfume, wool, and rope, and for items produced in workshops, such as metal, bracelets, types of cloth, garments, mats, pieces of furniture, tools, and a variety of stone and pottery vessels. The multiplication of token shapes in the protohistorical period, therefore, signals the addition of manufactured products to the goods accounted for in the temples. Accordingly, plain and complex tokens varied not only in their shapes, markings, and the way they were hanclled and stored but also in the types of commodities they represented. The plain tokens stood for products of the countryside, the complex ones for goods manufactured in cities.
Numerals

The invention of numerals on pictographic tablets provided a new formula to express numbers of tmits of goods. We know from the token contents of envelopes that tokens were repeated as many times as the number of items counted. "One jar of oil" was shown by one token standing for a jar of oil; "two jars of oil'' by two such tokens, "three jars of oil" by three tokens, and so on (figs. I2 and I6). This rudimentary system was replaced on pictographic tablets by numerals or signs used to express abstract numbers, such as 1, z, 3, etc. As a result, the pictographs were never repeated in a one-to-one correspondence to indicate the number of units involved, as was still the case for impressed signs. Instead, the pictographs were preceded by a numeral. For example, the sign for "jar of oil" was preceded by the sign for I, 2, 3, etc. The sign for I was a short wedge, identical to the sign for a small measure

84

THE

of grain; 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. were indicated by two, three, fOur, or five wedges; the sign for ro was a circular sign, identical to that for a larger measure of grain. In the same fashion, the sign for 6o \Vas a large wedge; f()r 6oo, a punched large wedge; and that for 3,6oo, a large circular sign. 176 It appears that the in1pressed signs, while retaining their primary meaning as grain measures, acquired a secondary meaning as nmnerals. This phenomenon of bifurcation is particularly explicit on tablets where, in the same text, identical signs are used alternately to express grain measures or numerals. Tablets recording the rations allotted to workers, for example, feature the same signs to indicate the number of workers paid and the quantities of grain they received. 177 The same is true in the Proto-Elamite system of writing. 178 Numerals created an econon1y of notation, since thirty-three jars of oil could be shown by six signs: three circles and three wedges. The importance of this bifurcation in the meaning of signs cmcially marks a cognitive departure in the quantification of goods.
THE PLACE OF IMPRESSED TABLETS IN THE EVOLUTION OF WRITING

The impressed tablets constitute the third step in the evolution from tokens to signs. They followed the stage of tokens and markings on envelopes and, in turn, were supplanted by pictography. ' The link between impressed tablets and envelopes is demonstrated by the many features they share. First, the impressed tablets adopted the same material from which envelopes were manufactured: they were modeled in clay. The tablets were also modeled in the same general shape and size as their immediate precursors. Adam Falkenstein noted that the earliest pictographic Uruk tablets were sometimes strikingly convex: perhaps they perpetuated the roundish shape of the former envelopes."' Of course, envelopes and tablets had a different structure. The envelopes were hollow, since their purpose was to hold and protect a number of tokens. As tokens carne to be eliminated, the tablets were naturally solid. The seal impressions covering the entire surface of most envelopes and tablets constitute another important similarity between the two types of artifacts. Not only were these sealings made by the same types of sealsnamely, mostly cylinders and more rarely stamp seals - bnt they also showed similar patterns carved in the same style. Featured among tl1e many motifs which occur on both types of artifacts, for example, arc temple representations and various types of vessels. 18° Furthermore, occasionally at Susa 181 as well as Uruk 182 a number of tablets and envelopes bore the impression of the same seal, attesting that the two ways of keeping records were handled by the same temple services or individuals. Most important, the signs of the impressed tablets are comparable- in form, technique, and disposition- to the signs displayed on envelopes. First, the same signs reoccur on both types of artifacts. In particular, all the markings impressed on envelopes- shott and long wedges, deep and shal-

low circles and ovals- continue unchanged in the repertory of signs on tablets. 183 The list of signs impressed on tablets, however, is longer than that of the markings on envelopes. This may be explained by the small sampling of 19 envelopes bearing markings, compared to some 240 impressed

tablets. Also, by the time tablets were in usc, the scribes had already exploited further the possibilities offered by two-dimensionality, creating new

signs. Thus, they manipulated the wedge, turning it sideways (sign rd) or doubling it (sign 1e).
Second, the techniques most frequently used to in1press 1narkings on envelopes prevailed on tablets. Thus, signs were still1nade by pressing to-

kens against the clay face of the tablets, as is visibly the case on Sb 2313 (fig. 19); otherwise, it was usual to use a blunt stylus (fig. 18). Third and finally, the signs were presented on the tablets in horizontal parallel lines, following the same hierarchical order as on the envelopes. One envelope from Susa, for example, displays a line of circular signs followed by a line of wedges, in exactly the same way signs were presented on a tablet. " 4 In turn, this may reflect tl1e hierarchical order and the parallel rows in which tokens were organized by prehistoric accountants. The fimction of impressed signs and of envelope markings, however, was radically different. The discrepancy lay in the role they played vis-a-vis
the clay counters. On envelopes, for the convenience of accountants, the

cushion shape and bearing seal impressions, until the Christian era. 185

Google Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips
Betsy Sparrow,1* Jenny Liu,2 Daniel M. Wegner3 The advent of the Internet, with sophisticated algorithmic search engines, has made accessing information as easy as lifting a finger. No longer do we have to make costly efforts to find the things we want. We can "Google" the old classmate, find articles online, or look up the actor who was on the tip of our tongue. The results of four studies suggest that when faced with difficult questions, people are primed to think about computers and that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself and enhanced recall instead for where to access it. The Internet has become a primary form of external or transactive memory, where information is stored collectively outside ourselves. n a development that would have seemed extraordinary just over a decade ago, many of us have constant access to information. If we need to find out the score of a ball game, learn how to perform a complicated statistical test, or simply remember the name of the actress in the classic movie we are viewing, we need only turn to our laptops, tablets, or smartphones and we can find the answers immediately. It has become so commonplace to look up the answer to any question the moment it occurs that it can feel like going through withdrawal when we can't find out something immediately. We are seldom offline unless by choice, and it is hard to remember how we found information before the Internet became a ubiquitous presence in our lives. The Internet, with its search engines such as Google and databases such as IMDB and the information stored there, has become an external memory source that we can access at any time. Storing information externally is nothing particularly novel, even before the advent of computers. In any long-term relationship, a team work environment, or other ongoing group, people typically develop a group or transactive memory (1), a combination of memory stores held directly by individuals and the memory stores they can access because they know someone who knows that information. Like linked computers that can address each other's memories,

people in dyads or groups form transactive memory systems (2, 3). The present research explores whether having online access to search engines, databases, and the like, has become a primary transactive memory source in itself. We investigate whether the Internet has become an external memory system that is primed by the need to acquire information. If asked the question whether there are any countries with only one color in their flag, for example, do we think about flags or immediately think to go online to find out? Our research then tested whether, once information has been accessed, our internal encoding is increased for where the information is to be found rather than for the information itself. In experiment 1, participants were tested in two within-subject conditions (4). Participants answered either easy or hard yes/no trivia questions in two blocks. Each block was followed by a modified Stroop task (a colornaming task with words presented in either blue or red) to test reaction times to matched computer and noncomputer terms (including general and brand names for both word groups). People who have been disposed to think about a certain topic typically show slowed reaction times (RTs) for naming the color of the word when the word itself is of interest and is more accessible, because the word captures attention and interferes with the fastest possible color naming. Paired within-subject t tests were conducted on color-naming reaction times to computer and general words after the easy and difficult question blocks. Confirming our hypothesis, computer words were more accessible [color-naming RT mean (M) = 712 ms, SD = 413 ms] than general words (M = 591 ms, SD = 204 ms) after VOL 333 SCIENCE

participants had encountered a series of questions to which they did not know the answers, t(68) = 3.26, P < 0.003, two-tailed. It seems that when we are faced with a gap in our knowledge, we are primed to turn to the computer to rectify the situation. Computer terms also interfered somewhat more with color naming (M = 603 ms, SD = 193 ms) than general terms (M = 559 ms, SD = 182 ms) after easy questions, t (68) = 2.98, P < 0.005, suggesting that the computer may be primed when the concept of knowledge in general is activated. Comparison using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of specific search engines (Google/Yahoo) and general consumergood brand names (Target/Nike) revealed an interaction with easy versus hard question blocks, F(1,66) = 5.02, P < 0.03, such that search engine brands after both easy questions (M = 638 ms, SD = 260 ms) and hard questions (M = 818 ms, SD = 517 ms) created more interference than general brands after easy questions (M = 584 ms, SD = 220 ms) and hard questions (M = 614 ms, SD = 226 ms) (Fig. 1). Simple effects tests showed that the interaction was driven by a significant increase in RT for the two search engine terms after the hard question block, F(1,66) = 4.44, P < 0.04 (Fig. 1). Although the concept of knowledge in general seems to prime thoughts of computers, even when answers are known, not knowing the answer to general-knowledge questions primes the need to search for the answer, and subsequently computer interference is particularly acute. In experiment 2, we tested whether people remembered information that they expected to have later access to--as they might with information they could look up online (4). Participants were tested in a 2 by 2 between-subject experiment by reading 40 memorable trivia statements of the type that one would look up online (both of the new information variety, e.g., "An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain," and information that may be remembered generally, but not in specific detail, e.g., "The space shuttle Columbia disintegrated during re-entry over Texas in Feb. 2003."). They then typed them into the computer to ensure attention (and also to provide a more generous test of memory). Half the participants believed the computer would save what was typed; half believed the item would be erased. In addition, half of the participants in each of the saved and erased conditions were asked explicitly to try to remember the information. After the reading and typing task, participants wrote down as many of the statements as they could remember.

A between-subjects 2 (saved or erased) by 2 (explicit memory instructions versus none) ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for only the saved/erased manipulation, as those who believed that the computer erased what they typed had the best recall, omnibus F(3, 56) = 2.80, P < 0.05 [Erase M = 0.31, SD = 0.04, and Erase Remember M = 0.29, SD = 0.07, paired comparisons of erased conditions not significant (ns)] compared with those who believed the computer would be their memory source (Save M = 0.22, SD = 0.07 and Save Remember M = 0.19, SD = 0.09, paired comparisons of saved conditions ns). This finding corresponds to previous work on directed forgetting, showing that when people don't believe they will need information for a later exam, they do not recall it at the same rate as when they do believe they will need it (5). Participants apparently did not make the effort to remember when they thought they could later look up the trivia statements they had read. Because search engines are continually available to us, we may often be in a state of not feeling we need to encode the information internally. When we need it, we will look it up. The main effect of the instruction to explicitly remember or not was not significant, which is similar to findings in the learning literature on intentional versus incidental studying of material, which generally finds that there is no difference of explicit instruction (6, 7). Participants were more affected by the cue that information would or would not be available to them later, regardless of whether they thought they would be tested on it. Fig. 1. Accessibility of brand names (as measured by color-naming reaction time) after blocks of easy or hard test items. Error bars, mean T SEM. In Experiment 3, we tested memory for where to find information that one might look up online. Participants again read and typed in items of memorable trivia, this time in three withinsubject conditions (4). For one-third of the questions, participants were shown "Your entry has been saved." For another one-third of the questions, participants were shown "Your entry has been saved into the folder X" (where X is one of six folders named FACTS, DATA, INFO, NAMES, ITEMS, or POINTS--generic interchangeable names to which the statements had previously been randomly assigned). For the final one-third of the questions, participants were shown "Your entry has been erased." Participants were given the expectation that they would have access to what they saved through a supposed "practice" trial in which they had access to the file folders during a "recall" task. Thus, generically saved, saved in a specific folder, and erased trials were created for all participants. Participants were then given a recognition task. They saw all 30 statements, half of which had been altered slightly (names or dates altered). Participants had to judge yes or no whether the statement they were now shown was exactly what they had read, whether the statement had been saved or erased, and finally, if the statement had been saved to a folder, which folder it had been saved into (they were given the folder names, and also had "no specific folder" and "erased" as answer options to this last question). Overall, in answer to the question "Was this statement exactly what you read?" participants recognized the accuracy of a large proportion of statements. But for those statements they believed had been erased, participants had the best memory (erase M = 0.93, SD = 0.09, pairwise comparisons to both saved conditions P < 0.05) compared with the statements participants believed they would continue to have access to (saved generically M = 0.88, SD = 0.12, and saved specifically to a folder M = 0.85, SD = 0.12, pairwise ns), repeated measures omnibus F (1, 27) = 4.01, P < 0.03. However, the opposite pattern was found for the question, "Was this statement saved or erased?" Participants accurately remembered what they had saved (saved generically M = 0.61, SD = 0.21, and saved into a folder M = 0.66, SD = 0.20, pairwise ns) more than they accurately remembered what they had erased (M = 0.51, SD = 0.19, pairwise comparisons with both saved conditions, P < 0.04), repeated measures ANOVA omnibus F (1, 27) = 5.34, P < 0.03. Thus, it appears that believing that one won't have access to the information in the future enhances memory for the information itself, whereas believing the information was saved externally enhances memory for the fact that the information could be accessed, at least in general. In this recognition task, when asked "If the information was saved, what folder was it saved into?" participants did remember more that the information was erased (M = 0.54, SD = 0.19, pairwise comparisons with both saved conditions, P < 0.001) than specifically whether the information was generically saved or which folder it was saved into (saved generically M = 0.30, SD = 0.20, and saved into a specific folder M = 0.23, SD = 0.14, pairwise comparisons ns), repeated-measures ANOVA omnibus F (1,27) = 21.67, P < 0.001. This result is a reminder of the experience of remembering something you have read online that you would like to see again or share but no longer remembering where you saw it or what steps you took to find it in the first place, or even knowing that a file is saved onto your hard drive but having to use the search feature to find it. The fact that some of the statements were saved in a general folder was important to include to rule out increased memory demands in the two saved conditions but does not parallel the continuous access to information we experience with current technology, in that there is no nameless depository of leftover information we would check after searching the obvious places. In addition, recognition is not usually the task we are charged with when answering someone's question. We need to recall the information we have gathered. Experiment 4 was conducted to see if people would recall where to find information more than the information itself. All participants expected trivia statements that they read and then typed to be saved to a specific folder with a generic name ("FACTS," etc., as in the previous experiment, although in this case there were no practice trials and the names and number of

folders was never explicitly called to the participants' attention) (4). Participants were then given a recall task, in which they were given 10 min to write down as many of the statements as they could remember. Participants finally were given an identifying feature of the statement that they read (and that had been saved), and they had to answer with the folder name in which it was saved. For example, for the statement "An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain," the question would be "What folder was the statement about the ostrich saved in?" Participants had to type into a dialog box called "Items" to recall this particular folder correctly. Folder names were not mentioned again, past the original typing period, and participants were never explicitly told there were six folder names where the items were saved. Overall, participants recalled the places where the statements were kept (M = 0.49, SD = 0.26) better than they recalled the statements themselves (M = 0.23, SD = 0.14), between-subject t(31) = 6.70, P < 0.001 two-tailed. These results seem unexpected on the surface, given the memorable nature of the statements and the unmemorable nature of the folder names. Also, these recall results are notable in comparison with the dismal level of recognition of which folder the statement was saved into in Experiment 3. However, several caveats need to be mentioned. Participants did have a cue to memory (a word from the trivia statement) with the folder recall that the statements themselves did not have. We were not able to counterbalance the trivia and the folders trials such that the folders were as numerous as the statements, which would be necessary to counterbalance the uncued and cued recall tasks. However, if we look at the pattern of what was remembered, the results do suggest that "where" was prioritized in memory, with the advantage going to "where" when "what" was forgotten. You might expect that, with the advantages of cued recall, participants would most remember the folder where statements were saved if they were cued both by our question and by their recalling the statement in the first place. To examine this, an if/then analysis was conducted giving participants separate scores for whether they (i) recalled both the statement and the folder where it was saved, (ii) recalled the statement but not the folder, (iii) didn't recall the statement but recalled the folder, or (iv) recalled neither the statement nor the folder. Participants were particularly poor at recalling both statement and folder (M = 0.17, SD = 0.16) and recalling the statement but not the folder (M = 0.11, SD = 0.08, pairwise comparison, ns). They were significantly more likely to recall nothing (M = 0.38, SD = 0.24), but surprisingly equally likely to recall the folder, when they didn't recall the statement (M = 0.30, SD = 0.16, pairwise ns), repeated measures ANOVA omnibus F (1, 31) = 11.57, P < 0.003 (Fig. 2). It would seem from this pattern that people don't remember "where" when they know "what" but do remember where to find the information when they don't recall it. This is preliminary evidence that when people expect information to remain continuously available (such as we expect with Internet access), they are more likely to remember where to find it than to remember the details of the item. One could argue that this is an adaptive use of memory--to include the computer and online search engines as an external memory system that can be accessed at will. Relying on our computers and the information stored on the Internet for memory depends on several of the same transactive memory processes that underlie social information-sharing in general. These studies suggest that people share information easily because they rapidly think of computers when they find they need knowledge (experiment 1). The social form of information storage is also reflected in the findings that people forget items they think will be available externally and remember items they think will not be available (experiments 2 and 3). Transactive memory is also evident when people seem better able to remember where an item has been stored than the identity of the item itself (experiment 4). These results suggest that processes of human memory are adapting to the advent of new computing and communication technology. Just as we learn through transactive memory who knows what in our families and offices, we are learning what the computer "knows" and when we should attend to where we have stored information in our computerbased memories. We are becoming symbiotic with our computer tools (8), growing into interconnected systems that remember less by knowing information than by knowing where the information can be found. This gives us the advantage of access to a vast range of information, although the disadvantages of being constantly "wired" are still being debated (9). It may be no more that nostalgia at this point, however, to wish we were less dependent on our gadgets. We have become dependent on them to the same degree we are dependent on all the knowledge we gain from our friends and co-workers--and lose if they are out of touch. The experience of losing our Internet connection becomes more and more like losing a friend. We must remain plugged in to know what Google knows.

It began raining a little from a hazy, cloudless-seeming sky as Paul, 26, and Michelle, 21, walked toward Chelsea to attend a magazine-release party in an art gallery. Paul had resigned to not speaking and was beginning to feel more like he was âmoving through the universeâ than âwalking on a sidewalk.â He stared ahead with a mask-like expression, weakly trying to remember where he was one year ago, last November, more for something to do than because he wanted to know, though he was not incurious. Michelle, to his left, drifted in and out of his peripheral visionâfar enough away for pedestrians to pass unknowingly between themâlike a slow, amorphous flickering. Paul was thinking the word âsomewhere,â meditatively as both placeholder and ends, when Michelle asked if he was okay.

âYes,â said Paul automatically. As they entered a building, a few minutes later, he sort of glanced at Michelle and was surprised to see her grinning, then couldnât stop himself from grinning. Sometimes, during an argument, feeling like heâd been acting in a movie and the scene had ended, Paul would suddenly grin, causing Michelle to grin, and theyâd be able to enjoy doing things together again, for one to forty hours, but that hadnât happened this time, partly because Michelle had grinned first. Paul looked away, slightly confused, and suppressed his grin. âWhat,â he said in an unintentionally loud monotone, unsure what he felt exactly, and they entered a large, mundane elevator, whose door closed slowly.

âWhat,â said Paul at a normal volume.

âNothing,â said Michelle still grinning a little.

âWhy are you grinning?â

âNo reason,â said Michelle.

âWhat caused you to grin?â

âNothing. Just life. The situation.â



Entering the party, on the fifth floor, Paul realized heâd said vaguely negative things on the internet, at some point, about a person who was probably in attendance, so walked quickly to Jeremyâan easy-to-talk-to acquaintanceâand asked what movies heâd seen recently. Michelle stood at a near distanceâpartly in view, then obscured, then fully in viewâbefore approaching, with what seemed like a sly smile, to ask if Paul wanted a drink. Jeremy was calculating aloud the per-hour price of a two-part biopic on Che Guevara when Michelle returned with a beer. Paul thanked her and she moved away in an intermittent, curving, crab-like manner, seeming relaxed and disoriented. âShe wants to be alone,â thought Paul with some confusion. âOr she wants to let me be alone.â

An hour later they were holding their third or fourth drinks, sitting on chairs in a dark corner, facing what seemed to Paul like one group of sixty to eighty friends. Loud, dancey, mostly electronic musicâcurrently Michael Jacksonâplayed from unseen speakers. Paul was staring at an area of torsos. In his previous relationships, he knew, he had experienced dissatisfaction, to some degree, as an empirically backed enthusiasm for the future, because it implied the possibility of a more satisfying relationship with someone he hadnât met; with Michelle, whom he felt closer to than his previous girlfriendsâheâd told her this a few times, truthfullyâdissatisfaction felt more like a personal failing, a direct indication of internal malfunctioning, which he should focus on privately correcting. Instead, he vaguely knew, he was waiting for Michelle, or some combination of Michelle and the world, to endure and overpower his negativityâto be the solution in which he would irreversibly, untraceably dissolve. He sipped his wine, thinking about how Michael Jackson had been using ten to forty Xanax per night, according to the internet, before he died last summer. Paul distractedly scooted his chair toward Michelle and, with unclear purpose, touched her shoulder, tentative and reckless as a child petting a large dog looking elsewhere. Expecting the bored expression of ten minutes ago, when theyâd looked at each other noncommittally as she returned to her chair with another drink, Paul was surprised by Michelleâs severely, activelyâalmost seethinglyâdepressed expression. Michelleâs face reddened antagonistically, in reflexive defense, it seemed, because then she appeared frustrated and a little confused, then shy and embarrassed. Paul asked if she wanted to leave soon. Michelle hesitated, then asked if that was what Paul wanted.

âI donât know. Are you hungry?â

âNot really. Are you?â

âI donât know,â said Paul. âI would eat somewhere.â One night, months ago, they had sat on a curb on Lafayette Street to continue an argument in a resting position. Paul had become distracted by Michelleâs calm, intelligent demeanor and had begun to forget why they were arguing, even while speaking in an agitated voice, as he became fixated, with increasing appreciation, on how Michelle liked him enough to not simply leave and never see him again, which she could doâwhich anyone could always do, Paul had thought, suddenly intrigued by the concept of gratitude. âDo you want to eat at the Green Table?â

âIf thatâs what you want,â said Michelle.

âOkay. When do you want to leave?â

âAfter I finish this glass of wine.â

âOkay,â said Paul, and scooted his chair halfway to where it had been. âIâm going to introduce Kyle to someone. Iâll be back in like five minutes.â



Paul couldnât find Kyle, 19, or Kyleâs girlfriend, Gabby, 28âhis suitemates in an apartment off the Graham L train stop in Brooklynâand was returning to Michelle when he realized heâd walked past Kyle, standing drunkenly alone in a dense area of people, as if at a concert. After some indecision, briefly motionless, Paul turned around and asked if Kyle wanted to meet Traci. Kyle nodded and followed Paul outside the gallery, to a wide hallway, where six people, including Traciâdescribed earlier by Kyle as âreally hot,â by Paul as âher blog gets a lot of hitsââshook hands with one another. Paul grinned uncomfortably as he stared at one person, then another, thinking he had âabsolutely nothingâ to say, except maybe what he was currently thinking, which didnât seem appropriate and also kept changing. He noticed Michelle sitting alone, against a wall, around thirty feet away. The front of his head felt extraneous and suctioned as a plastic bag, stuck there in a wind, as he walked to her, aware she had probably seen him grinning at Traci, and asked if she wanted to go now.

âDo you?â said Michelle not standing.

âYeah,â said Paul looking toward the gallery.

âYou can talk to Kyle more, if you want.â

âI donât want to,â said Paul.

âIt seems like you do.â

âI donât,â said Paul, who viewed friends mostly as means to girlfriends, he knew, contrary to Michelle, who valued them as ends (theyâd discussed this a few times and concluded, to some degree, that Paul had his writing, Michelle her friends). âIâm just going to say bye to him. Iâll be right back.â When he couldnât find Kyle in the hallway he walked robotically into the dark, crowded gallery thinking âlost in the worldâ in a precariously near-earnest tone. Kyle was standing with a group of people in a sideways manner that didnât clearly indicate if he knew them or not. He looked at Paul with an expression like he was thinking what to say, then like he was going to insult Paul, then less like heâd chosen to refrain than like heâd lost interest.

âI think Michelle feels like Iâm not giving her enough attention,â said Paul slowly.

âThatâs funny,â said Kyle after a few seconds. âBecause Gabby, after one of our parties, said you gave Michelle so much attention and were always next to her talking to her, but Iâm always talking to someone else, and that I donât love her.â

âWhat did you say?â

âThat I love her and give her attention,â said Kyle with a bored, self-loathing expression.



Paul couldnât find Michelle in the hallway, then turned a corner and saw her crouched on the floor, sixty to eighty feet away, discrepant and vulnerable, in the bright off-white corridor, as a rarely seen animal. Paul, walking self-consciously toward her, vaguely remembered a night, early in their relationship, when he somehow hadnât expected her to enlarge in his vision as he approached where sheâd stood (looking down at a flyer, one leg slightly bent) in Think Coffee. The comical, bewildering fearâequally calming and surprising, amusing and forebodingâheâd felt as she rapidly and sort of ominously increased in size had characterized their first two months together. It had seemed like they would never fight, and the nothingness of the future had gained a framework-y somethingness that felt privately exciting, like entering a different familyâs house as a small child, or the beginning elaborations of a science-fiction conceit. Then, one night, in late April, after cooking and eating pasta together, Paul had complainedâmeekly, without looking at her faceâthat Michelle never helped wash dishes. Michelle stared at him silently a few seconds before her eyes became suddenly watery, the extra layer of translucence materializing like a shedding of something delicate. Paul stared back, weirdly entrancedâheâd never seen her cryâbefore crawling across his wood floor, over his yoga mat, dizzy with emotion, to hug her and apologize. In May he began complaining once or twice a week (that certain things Michelle did were inconsiderate, that he felt neglected) and, by July, most days, was either visibly irritated or mutely, inscrutably despondentâas if he alone had a vast knowledge of horrible truths, which, he knew, he didnâtâbut could still feel good, to some degree, after coffee or alcohol or, when easily attainable, prescription drugs, most recently methadone, supplied by Michelleâs friend who had fallen down stairs, which theyâd ingested once every four to six days for five weeks, ending three weeks ago. One night, since then, Michelle had told Paul it seemed like he âhatedâ her and Paul, after around ten seconds, had cited a day theyâd had fun together, then had grinned and said ânoâ illogically when Michelle correctly said theyâd been on methadone that day.

âWhy are you sitting so far away?â

âIâm waiting for you. You said you wanted to leave an hour ago.â



Outside, on the sidewalk, Michelle walked quickly ahead with her hands in her jacket pockets, as if to better escape Paul with a more streamlined form, though also it was still raining. Paul asked what she wanted to do. âI donât know,â she said. âIâm not hungry anymore.â

They crossed 10th Avenue in a diagonal, not at an intersection, through headlights of a stopped taxiâtwo or three people were closing their umbrellas, getting inâonto the opposite sidewalk and continued downtown, bodies bent against the wind.

âWait,â said Paul. âCan we stop walking for a minute?â

They stopped, facing the same direction, on the sidewalk.

âWhatâs wrong?â said Paul after a few seconds, slightly accusatorily.

âYouâve been ignoring me all night,â said Michelle.

âI moved close to you and hugged you, when we were sitting.â

âOnce we got inside you walked away and started talking to other people.â

âYou walked away from me,â said Paul. âI felt confused.â

A deli worker standing under an awning was looking into some unspecific distance, honestly uninterested. âIâve never felt you act this way before,â said Michelle unsteadily, looking down, suddenly tired and scared, the protest of her having dispersed to something negotiable. For a few days, two or three months ago, she had considered studying abroad in Barcelona next spring, which wouldâve meant four months apart. Paul thought of how theyâd kept delaying buying plane tickets to visit his parents in Taiwanâin December, which was next month, he knewâas if in tacit understanding that their relationship wouldnât last that long. Paul felt himself trying to interpret the situation, as if there was a problem to be solved, but there didnât seem to be anything, or maybe there was, but he was three or four skill sets away from comprehension, like an amoeba trying to create a personal web-page using CSS.

âIâm just naturally losing interest,â he finally said, a little improvisationally, and Michelle began quietly crying. âI didnât expect this at all,â she said. âIâve felt good about us the past two weeks. I thought weâve been closer than weâve ever been.â

âI think I was affected by the study-abroad thing,â said Paul nearly inaudibly, confused how sheâd thought theyâd been close the past two weeks.

âGo back to the party. Iâll talk to you tomorrow.â

âWait. I donât think we should leave each other now.â

âHave a good time with your friends,â said Michelle sincerely.

âWait. What friends?â

âWeâll talk tomorrow,â said Michelle.

âIf we leave each other now itâs over.â

âIt doesnât have to be like that.â

âI only go to things to find a girlfriend,â said Paul paraphrasing himself, and they stood not looking at each other, for one or two minutes, as rain from faraway places disappeared into their clothing and hair. Paul felt surprised by the friendly tone of his voice as he asked if Michelle wanted to eat dinner with him, in a restaurant.

âI donât want to talk to you right now,â said Michelle.

âI donât want to be in a relationship where itâs like this.â

âI donât either,â said Michelle.

âIâm going back if you donât want to do something.â

âI want to go home. Good night.â

âOkay,â said Paul, and turned around, aware they hadnât parted like this before. He crossed 22nd Street and turned to cross 10th Avenue and saw Michelle disjunctively running and walking toward him, stopping at a red light with the posture of a depressed teenager. Paul thought of how she liked Nirvana a lot, and she crossed the street, slowing as she neared and stopping within armâs reach. âPaul,â she said after a few seconds, and touched his upper arm, as if to offer a way back, through her, to some prior intimacy, from where they could tunnel carefully elsewhere, or to the same place, but with a kind of skill this time, having practiced once. Paul remained still, unsure what to say or think. Michelle lowered her hand to her side. âWhat are you doing?â she said, somewhat defensively.

âWhat do you mean?â

âArenât you going back to the party?â

âYeah. I said I was.â

âFine,â said Michelle.

Paul felt passively committed to not moving.

âWhy are you standing here?â

âYou came back,â said Paul feebly, and four to six people approached from the direction of the party. Michelle stepped into a soil-y area, lower and darker than the sidewalk, and leaned between spires on a metal fence, with her left profileâobscured by her long, dark hairâtoward Paul, who stared dumbly at the gently convex curve of her back, thinking with theoretical detachment that he should console her and that maybe the discomfort of her forearms against the thin metal of the fence had created a location, accessible only to herself, toward which she could relocate, away from what she felt, in a kind of shrinking. âDo youââ said Paul, and coughed twice with his mouth closed. âDo you want to eat dinner with me somewhere?â Michelle turned toward him a little, moving her head to see through her hair. âWhat are you doing?â she said in a tired, distracted voice, and leaned back on the fence without waiting for an answer. After a vague amount of time Paul heard himself asking again if she wanted to eat dinner with him, at the Green Table, one of the few restaurants they wanted to but hadnât tried, then she was walking away, her long legs scissor-like in their little, orderly movements. It would take her thousands of steps to get anywhere, but she would get there easily, and when she arrived, in the present, it would seem like it had been a single movement that brought her there. Did existence ever seem worked for? One seemed simply to be here, less an accumulation of moments than a single arrangement continuously gifted from some inaccessible future.

As Michelle became smaller, then out of view, Paul distantly sensed the implication, from his previous thoughts, which heâd mostly forgotten, that the universe in its entirety was a message, to itself, to not feel badâan ever-elaborating, languageless rhetoric against feeling badâand he was troubled by this, suspecting that his thoughts and intentions, at some point, in April or May or years ago, in college or as a child, had been wrong, but he had continued in that wrongness, and was now distanced from some correct beginning to a degree that the universe (and himself, a part of the universe) was articulately against him.

In his tiredness and inattention these intuitions manifested in Paul as an uncomplicated feeling of bleaknessâthat he was in the center of something bad, whose confines were expanding, as he remained in the same place. Faintly he recognized in this a kind of humor, but mostly he was aware of the rain, continuous and everywhere as an incognizable information, as he crossed the magnified street, gleaming and blacker from wetness, to return to the party.



Michelleâs absence in Taiwan was mentioned once, at dinner with eight to twelve relatives, a week into Paulâs visit, when Paulâs father, 61, characteristically without prompting or context, loudly joked that Paulâs girlfriends always left him, then laughed in an uncontrollable-seeming, close-eyed, almost wincing manner. Paulâs mother, 57, responded with aggravation that the opposite was true and that Paulâs father shouldnât âlie recklessly,â she said in Mandarin.

Paul hadnât seen his parents since they sold their house in Florida a year and a half ago and moved back to Taiwan, after almost thirty years in America, into a fourteenth-floor apartment, in a rapidly developing area of Taipei, with two guest rooms that his mother had repeatedly stressed were Paulâs room and Paulâs brotherâs room. Paul thought his parents looked the same, but he viewed his mother, who had been diagnosed as âprediabetic,â a little differently, maybe as finally past middle age, though not yet elderly. Her emails, the past eight months, had frequently mentioned, as sort of asides, or reminders, to herself mostly, that she was using less sugar in her daily coffee, but really shouldnât be using anyâher most emphasized message to her family, the past two decades, in Paulâs view, was the importance of health to a happy lifeâthough her doctor had said the amount she used was okay, and on days without sugar in her coffee, which was decaf, she felt âempty, like something is missing,â she had said in one email.

When, one afternoon, Paul saw her putting sugar in her coffee, it seemed to them both like sheâd been âcaughtâ doing something wrong. She blushed and briefly focused self-consciously on stirring her coffee with a little spoon, then she looked at Paul and her mouth reflexively opened in an endearingly child-like, self-concious, almost mischievous display of guilt and shame and repentance that Paul recognized from the rare times heâd seen her do things sheâd told him not to do, such as eat food that had fallen on the floor. After a grinning Paul obligatorily said something negative about sugar, that everyone, not only diabetics, should avoid it, his motherâs expression resolved to the controlled, smirking, wryly satisfied demeanor of an adult who is slightly more amused than embarrassed to have been caught idly succumbing to a meager comfort that theyâve openly disapproved of for themselves and others. Paul unintentionally caught his mother using sugar two more times, the next two weeks, resulting in similarâbut less intenseâreactions and outcomes. The 24oz organic raw agave nectar he had mailed her, believing it was the safest sweetener for diabetics, had been opened but not used, it seemed, more than once or twice.

His fourth week in Taiwan, one more week than planned, his mother began encouraging him two or three times a dayâwith a slightly affected, strategic nonchalance, Paul feltâto move to Taiwan for one year to teach English. She mentioned Ernest Hemingway more than once while saying Paul would benefit, as a writer, from the interesting experience. Paul said he would benefit by being in America, where he could speak the language and maintain friendships and âdo things,â he said in Mandarin, visualizing himself on his back, on his yoga mat, with his MacBook on the inclined surface of his thighs, formed by bending his knees, looking at the internet. His parents encouraged him to stay a fifth week, which with some difficulty he decided against, thinking it âexcessive,â after whichâhis last few days in Taiwanâhis mother began to stress that he should visit every December from now on, stating it as a fact, then making a noise meaning âright?â Paulâs responses ranged from âmaybe,â to neutral-to-annoyed noises, to an explanation of why the more she pressured him the less influence sheâd have on his decisions.

At the airport Paulâs mother stayed with Paul until she wasnât allowed farther without a ticket. She pointed at her eyes and said they were watery. Paul was ârequired,â she said in Mandarin with mock sternness, to visit next December.

In the terminal, sitting with eyes closed, Paul imagined moving alone to Taipei at an age like 51, when maybe heâd have cycled through enough friendships and relationships to not want more. Because his Mandarin wasnât fluent enough for conversations with strangersâand he wasnât close to his relatives, with whom attempts at communication were brief and non-advancing and often koan-like, ending usually with one person looking away, ostensibly for assistance, then leavingâheâd be preemptively estranged, secretly unfriendable. The unindividualized, shifting mass of everyone else would be a screen, distributed throughout the city, onto which heâd project the movie of his uninterrupted imagination. Because heâd appear to, and be able to pretend he was, but never actually be a part of the mass, maybe heâd gradually begin to feel a kind of needless intimacy, not unlike being in the same room as a significant other and feeling affection without touching or speaking. An earnest assembling of the backup life heâd sketched and constructed the blueprints and substructures for (during the average of six weeks per year, spread throughout his life, that heâd been in Taiwan) would begin, at some point, after which, months or years later, one morning, he would sense the independent organization of a second, itinerant consciousnessâlured here by the new, unoccupied structuresâtoward which heâd begin sending the data of his sensory perception. The antlered, splashing, water-treading land animal of his first consciousness would sink to some lower region, in the lake of himself, where he would sometimes descend in sleep and experience its disintegrating particlesâand furred pieces, brushing pastâin dreams, as it disappeared into the pattern of the nearest functioning system.

On the plane, after a cup of black coffee, Paul thought of Taipei as a fifth season, or âotherworld,â outside, or in equal contrast with, his increasingly familiar and self-consciously repetitive life in America, where it seemed like the seasons, connecting in right angles, for some misguided reason, had formed a square, sarcastically framing nothingâor been melded, Paul vaguely imagined, about an hour later, facedown on his arms on his dining tray, into a door-knocker, which a child, after twenty to thirty knocks, no longer expecting an answer, has continued using, in a kind of daze, distracted by the pointlessness of his activity, looking absently elsewhere, unaware when he will abruptly, idly stop.

Something staticky and paranormally ventilated about the air, which drifted through a half-open window, late one afternoon, caused a delicately waking Paul, clutching a pillow and drooling a little, to believe he was a small child in Florida, in a medium-size house, on or near winter break. He felt dimly excited, anticipating a hyperactive movement of his body into a standing position, then was mostly unconscious for a vague amount of time until becoming aware of what seemed to be a baffling non sequiturâand, briefly, in its mysterious approach from some eerie distance, like someone elseâs consciousnessâbefore resolving plainly as a memory, of having already left Florida, at some point, to attend New York University. After a deadpan pause, during which the new information was accepted by default as recent, he casually believed it was autumn and he was in college, and as he felt that periodâs particular gloominess he sensed a concurrent assembling, at a specific distance inside himself, of dozens of once-intimate images, people, places, situations. With a sensation of easily and entirely abandoning a prior context, of having no memory, he focused, as an intrigued observer, on this assembling and was surprised by an urge, which he immediately knew he hadnât felt in months, or maybe years, to physically involve himselfâby going outside and living each day patientlyâin the ongoing, concrete occurrence of what he was passively, slowly remembering. But the emotion dispersed to a kind of nothingnessâand its associated memories, like organs in a lifeless body, became rapidly indiscernible, dissembling by the metaphysical equivalent, if there was one, of entropyâas he realized, with some confusion and an oddly instinctual reluctance, blinking and discerning his new room, which after two months could still seem unfamiliar, that he was somewhere else, as a different person, in a much later year.

He kept his eyes pressurelessly closed and didnât move, wanting to returnâwithout yet knowing who or what he wasâto sleep, where he could intensify and prolong and explore what he residually felt and was uncontrollably forgetting, but was already alert, in concrete reality, to a degree that his stillness, on his queen-size mattress, felt like a kind of hiding. He stared at the backs of his eyelids with motionless eyeballs, slightly feigning not knowing what he was looking atâwhich also felt like a kind of hidingâand gradually discerned that he was in Brooklyn, on an aberrantly colder day in late March, in the two-person apartment, in a four-story house, where he had moved, a few weeks after returning from Taiwan, because Kyle and Gabby had wanted more space, to âsave their relationship.â

It was spring, not winter or autumn, Paul thought with some lingering confusion. He listened to the layered murmur of wind against leaves, familiarly and gently disorienting as a terrestrial sound track, reminding people of their own lives, then opened his MacBookâsideways, like a hardcover bookâand looked at the internet, lying on his side, with his right ear pressed into his pillow, as if, unable to return to sleep, at least in position to hear what, in his absence, might be happening there.



That nightâafter leaving his room at dusk, then âworking on thingsâ in an underground computer lab in Bobst Library, as he did most daysâPaul became âcompletely lost,â he repeatedly thought, in a tundra-like area of Brooklyn for around twenty minutes before unexpectedly arriving at the arts space hosting the panel discussion, on the topic of self-publishing, heâd agreed to attend with his literary acquaintance Anton, 23, who was visiting from Norway. Paul began, at some point, during the ninety-minute discussion, to feel a mocking, sitcom-like conviction that, for him, âtoo many years had passedâ since collegeâthat without educationâs season-backed, elaborately subdivided, continuous structure, traceable numerically backward almost to birth, connecting a life in that direction, he was becoming isolated and unexplainable as one of those mysterious phenomena, contained within informational boxes, in picture-heavy books on natural history, which he wouldâve felt scared, as a child, if he was alone in a dark room, to think about for too long. After the ninety-minute discussion, which seemed unanimously in favor of self-publishing, the audience was instructed, somewhat anticlimactically, to bring their folding chairs to another room and lean them against a wall, then Paul and Anton stood waiting for Juan, 24, an MFA student in fiction at NYU, whoâd wanted to eat with them but was talking to an attractive woman.

âWhat should we do?â said Paul.

âI donât know,â said Anton in a quiet monotone.

They decided to leave in three minutes, at 9:01. This was Paulâs second or third social situation involving more than one person, excluding himself, since returning from Taiwan, two months ago. His only regular communication since his relationship with Michelle ended three and a half months ago was emails and Gmail chats with Charles, 25, who lived in Seattle with his girlfriend and who had sold most of his belongings, the past few months, in preparation to leave America indefinitely to travel alone in Mexicoâand eventually South Americaâbecause he felt âalienated,â heâd said.

âItâs 9:04,â said Anton.

âWhat should we do?â

âWe could wait until 9:10.â

âI donât know,â said Paul grinning. âI donât know. Letâs just leave now, I think.â He didnât move for around ten seconds. âWe should go,â he said, and after a few seconds moved toward the exit, feeling slightly oxygen deprived.

âHey,â said Juan running. âAre you guys going to eat now?â

âYeah,â said Paul, and glanced, for some reason, at Anton, whose eyes, behind medium-thick lenses, appeared farther away but of higher resolution than the rest of his face.

âSorry,â said Juan looking at Anton.

âItâs called Pacifico,â said Paul outside. âThe address is 97 Smith.â

âI think Pacific is this way,â said Juan.

âPacifico,â said Paul looking at Anton, who seemed to be grinning.

âThis way,â said Juan rolling his bike beside him.

âWait,â said Paul. âThe restaurant is called Pacifico.â

âI kept thinking it was on Pacific,â said Juan with a serious expression.

âNo,â said Paul. âBut itâs probably near Pacific.â



In Pacifico, a dungeon-like Mexican restaurant, Paul stared at his menu, waiting for his eyes to adjust in the diffuse lighting. He was aware of Anton and Juan, across the table, also holding and staring at menus. When their burritos arrived he noticed, with preemptively suppressed interpretation, that his, of the three, appeared slightly darkest. Then a large group of males from the panel discussion entered and seated themselves in a swarming and disorganized manner, which Paul experienced as a parody of surrounding a heterosexual, single male with a variety of ethnicities and ages of males.

While idly eating the salad-y remains of his burrito with a fork, around twenty minutes later, Paul became aware of himself analyzing when he shouldâve left. He vaguely traced back the night and concluded he shouldâve left when, on his way to the venue, he had been âcompletely lost.â He allowed himself to consider earlier opportunities, mostly for something to do, and discerned after a brief sensation of helplessnessâlike if heâd divided 900 by itself and wanted the calculator to answer 494/494 or 63/63âthat, in terms of leaving this social situation, he shouldnât have been born. He suppressed a grin, then channeled the impulse into the formation of what he thought of as a nervous smile and stood and mumbled âIâm going to sleep nowâ and ânice seeing youâ until he was outside, where it was windy and cold.

He walked toward an F train station, aware of the strangeness of clouds at nightâtheir enveloped flatness and dimensional vagueness, shifting and osmotic as some advanced form of gaseous amoebaâand remembered when he got lodged in an upside-down wood stool, as a small child, in Florida. His father had sawed off two rungs with an enormous, floppy, serrated blade while his mother, alternately grinning and intensely focused, careful not to allow her personal experience of the event impair its documentation, photographed them from different angles, sometimes directing their attention to the camera, like in a photo shoot.



The next two weeks Paul gradually began to view the five months until September, when his second novel would be published and he would go on a two-month book tour, as an âinterim period,â during which he would mostly be alone, âcalmly organizing things,â he said in an email to his mother. He had already been mostly alone, he knew, since returning from Taiwan, but in a vague way, often wondering if he shouldâve gone to whatever social gathering. Now if he felt urges to socialize, to meet a romantic prospect, he would simply relocate them, without further consideration, beyond the âinterim period,â when he would be extremely social, he envisioned. Until then he would calmly focus on being productive in a low-level manner, finding to-do lists and unfinished projects in his Gmail account and further organizing, working on, or deleting them, for example.

In early April he got an email from Traci asking if she could email-interview him for a website. After a few emails Paul asked Traci, whom he now reasonably, he felt, viewed as a romantic prospect, if she wanted to meet for dinner. At an Asian fusion restaurant, which Traci had suggested, they talked for around fifteen minutes, during which Paulâs interest steadily increased, before Traci mentioned living with her boyfriend. Paul was aware of the ice hockey game on the flat-screen TV attached to a wall, of the disparity between Thai food and ice hockey, as he slowly said âis, um, is it a studio apartment?â

Walking alone, to his room, an hour later, he realized he was deriving comfort from the existence, in his life, of a âbackup prospect.â There was a specific girl he liked who liked him back, but he couldnât remember who, it seemed. When he realized heâd been thinking of Anton, that heâd unconsciously de-gendered and abstracted Anton into a kind of silhouette, which heâd successfully presented to himself as a romantic prospect, he grinned uncontrollably for around thirty seconds, almost getting hit by a minivan when, rerouting to a darker street to better hide his face, he jogged somewhat recklessly across an intersection.



Paul felt more committed, after that, to viewing the time until September as an interim period, and didnât have an in-person conversation for more than a week, during which, to his own approval, he seemed to be settling, if precariously, with two days spent mostly eating, into a somewhat productive, loneliness-free routine. He remembered while peeling a banana one night that he had committed, months ago, to a reading in Aprilâin three days, he learned from the internet, in a building near Times Square.

At the reading, after arriving ten minutes early by accident and talking to the organizer, then sitting alone and, to appear occupied, holding a pen and staring down at what heâd printed in the libraryâan account of his visit to Taiwan, four months agoâwhere he planned to return immediately after he and Frederick, an author in his early 40s, finished reading, Paul began to feel sleepy, in his seat. Yawning, he looked up and recognized Mitch, 26, a classmate from middle/ high school in Florida, where they had mutual friends but had never spoken to each other, that Paul could remember, approaching from a conspiratorially far distance, like an FBI agent but slower. Mitch had messaged on Facebook, a few weeks ago, that he might attend this reading.

âYou look the same. What about me?â

âTaller,â said Mitch seeming a little nervous.

âHow can you tell? Iâm sitting.â

âThe shape of your legs, and your body, I think. Something about your bone structure.â



After the reading Lucie, 23, introduced herself and Amy, 23, and Daniel, 25, to Paul and Mitch, saying something about her and Amyâs online magazine. Paul asked if they had business cards, not thinking they would. Amy, after encouragement from Lucie, reluctantly gave Paul a business card, seeming a little embarrassed. When Paul looked up from the business card, putting it in his back pocket, he was startled by the sudden appearance of Frederick smiling at him with his arm around Lucie in a manner that seemed calculated, but wasnât, Paul knew, to firmly establish they were âtogether.â A bewildered-seeming, middle-aged woman with an Italian accent asked Paul something about agave nectar, wanting it for a diabetic friend, it seemed. Paul said heâd actually learned, a few months ago, that it raised blood sugar as intensely as sugar and that heâd mailed his mother unheated, unfiltered honey, which was the healthiest sweetenerâfor diabetics, or anyoneâbased on what he currently knew, which could be wrong, he also knew.

In a taxi to a party, forty minutes later, Paul imagined another him walking toward the library and, for a few seconds, visualizing the position and movement of two red dots through a silhouetted, aerial view of Manhattan, felt as imaginary, as mysterious and transitory and unfindable, as the other dot. He visualized the vibrating, squiggling, looping, arcing line representing the three-dimensional movement, plotted in a cubic grid, of the dot of himself, accounting for the different speed and direction of each vessel of which he was a passengerâtaxi, Earth, solar system, Milky Way, etc. Adding a fourth dimension, representing time, he visualized the patterned scribbling shooting off in one direction, with a slight wobble, miles from where it was seconds ago. He imagined his trajectory as a vacuum-sealed tube, into which heâd arrived and through whichâtraveling alone in the vacuum-sealed tube of his own lifeâheâd be suctioned and from which heâd exit, as a successful delivery to some unimaginable recipient. Realizing this was only his concrete history, his public movement through space-time from birth to death, he briefly imagined being able to click on his trajectory to access his private experience, enlarging the dot of a coordinate until it could be explored like a planet.

At the party, which was mostly people in their 30s and 40s, Paul asked Amy an open-ended question about her parents. When she began, after a pause, to answer, he moved his phone from his pants pocket to his ear. âHello,â he said in a clear voice, and felt physically isolated, like he was wearing a motorcycle helmet, as he peripherally observed Amy moving her wine, almost spilling it, to her mouth.

âJust kidding,â said Paul. âNo one called me.â

Amy had a glassy, disoriented expression.

âI donât have a phone call,â said Paul.

âThat was good,â said Amy looking away.

âJust kidding,â said Paul grinning weakly.

The rest of the party, after briefly talking to Lucie, who invited him and Mitch to a party next week at her apartment, Paul talked mostly to Daniel, who had enough money from selling marijuana in San Francisco that he hadnât had a job since moving here last autumn. Paul asked if Daniel liked drugs. Daniel said he liked âbenzosâ and opiates. Paul asked if he liked Rilo Kiley and he became quiet a few seconds, seeming worried, like he might not be able to answer, before saying âum, not really.â



Paul went with Daniel, the next night, to a BBQ-themed party, where their main focus, soon after arriving, was on discerning how to leave tactfully, considering how much food theyâd eaten and how little they were contributing to conversation, for a party at Kyle and Gabbyâs apartment. Standing in a kitchen, at one point, while Daniel was outside smoking, Paul felt like a shark whose eyes have protectively âglossed overâ during a feeding frenzy, as he mechanically ate salad, cheese, a burger, apple pie, chips while vaguely focused on not doing anything to cause others to talk to him.

At Kyle and Gabbyâs apartmentâhis first time back since moving outâPaul uncharacteristically approached an intriguing, attractive stranger named Laura and asked her questions with a serious expression, standing at a maybe too-close distance, as if after an unskillful teleportation he didnât want to underscore by fixing. Laura was here with her friend Walter, who knew Gabby. Paul could see that Laura, who wasnât looking at him, didnât like his presence and was getting annoyed, but due to alcohol he felt unaffected by this information and kept asking questions, including her age and what college, if any, she attended, or had attended. As Lauraâs annoyance intensified to a slightly curious disbelief she became extra alertâfocusing exclusively on Paul with a challenging, vigilante expression. She asked why he was asking so many questions.

âIâm not. Iâm just trying to talk.â

âWhy are you interrogating me?â

âIâm just trying to have a conversation.â

âWhat college did you go to?â said Laura accusatorily.

âNew York University. How old are you?â

Laura walked away, somewhat aimlessly, into the room Paul crawled across the first time he saw Michelle cryâaround a year ago, he realized. In the room now was a king-size bed, which occupied maybe 80 percent of its surface. Paul was sitting alone, at the snack table, thirty minutes later, when Laura approached with a bored expression, unaware of his presence until he stood and said âI highly recommend the Funyunsâ in an exaggeratedly helpful voice, choosing Funyunsâcorn in the shape and flavor of fried rings of onionâsomewhat randomly from the eight to twelve snacks on the table.

âOh, really?â said Laura reciprocating his tone.

âLet me help you,â said Paul lifting the giant plastic red bowl toward Laura, who chose and bit a piece, then moved backward a little, with a playful expression, nodding and smiling, before turning around and walking away, reappearing around twenty minutes later at a near distance, moving directly, as if after a search, toward an inattentive Paul, seated in the same chair as earlier, not apparently doing anything. Before he could say anything about Funyuns, or form any thoughts, Laura had told him her full name, which she wanted him to memorize, quizzing him on it twiceâcrudely, functionallyâbefore abruptly walking away.



Around midnight an aimlessly wandering Gabby, appearing lost in her own kitchen, stopped in front of Daniel and said âyou have a nose ring,â with a slightly confused expression to Daniel, who confirmed he did. Gabby, a foot and a half shorter than Daniel, stared up at him a few seconds before saying something that, Paul thought, conveyed she earnestly believed nose rings were objectively bad. She asked where Daniel was from and said âoh, that makes sense, then,â appearing visibly less tense, when Daniel said San Francisco.

Paul, staring at Danielâs left profile, said âI just realized you look like Hugh Jackman.â

âHe looks like Richard Tuttle,â said Gabby.

âI donât know who that is,â said Daniel.

Gabby said Richard Tuttle was a famous artist. Daniel said when he was young his father only brought him to galleries and museums whenever they went anywhere. Paul heard someone say âsculptor.â Someone who didnât know Daniel drunkenly said âhe got the nose ring so people wonât think heâs Hugh Jackmanâ to Paul at close range. Gabby mentioned another artist Daniel didnât know and Paul began to sometimes say âyouâre too mainstream for usâ in a loud, sarcastic voice while staring at Gabbyâthinking that, by underscoring that he and Daniel were obviously too mainstream for her, he was sincerely complimenting her knowledge of the art worldâwho ignored him easily, with no indication of any awareness of his presence. When Gabby finally looked at him, seeming more confused than agitated, Paul sarcastically sustained a huge grin, which Gabby stared at blankly while appearing to be thinking, very slowly, due to alcohol, about what, if anything, she should do about what was happening. After around five seconds she walked away with a slight, momentary wobble. Kyle appeared around fifteen minutes later and said âleaveâ to Daniel, who was grinning about something else.

âHuh?â said Daniel.

âLeave,â said Kyle.

âAre you serious?â

âYes,â said Kyle, and Paul realized, with a sensation of low-level epiphany, that Gabby, offended by the nose-ring encounter, must have forced Kyle to tell Daniel to leave. Paul said this aloud a few times, to seemingly no one, then asked why Kyle was âbeing mean.â Daniel said he would leave after he finished his drink and Kyle said âthatâs fineâ and walked away.

âJesus,â said Paul. âGabby hates nose rings.â

âI didnât think she was angry when we talked,â said Daniel.

âYouâre probably benefiting this party the most out of anyone,â said Paul. âYouâre standing in one place, occasionally saying something witty, causing people passing by to laugh. Youâre not even eating anything.â

âI planned to go to another party anyway,â said Daniel.



Almost half the party, thirty minutes later, was on the wide sidewalk outside the apartment building, grinning drunk-enly or looking at one another with openly bored or neutral expressions, waiting for directions to the other party. Paul, who was grinning uncontrollably, had approached groups of acquaintances asking if they wanted to go to a different party while a cheerful-seeming Daniel, standing in place in the kitchen, sometimes assumed the role of an unruly tyrant, saying things like âget every single personâ and âwe arenât leaving until you get every person.â Paul had wanted to tell Daniel he shouldnât want so much from life but couldnât remember the stock phrase for âdonât want too much in lifeâ and, after a long pause, had said âyou shouldnât want so much in life.â Mitch had repeatedly held shots of tequila toward Paul, who drank two and, at one point, entered the small room where Kyle and Gabby slept and interrupted Gabby and Jeremy and Juan by asking if âanyoneâ wanted to go to âa different party,â aware he was unaffected, due to alcohol, by Gabbyâs presence.

Someone said it probably wasnât a good idea to stand âin a giant mass blocking the entire sidewalkâ in front of the party theyâd just abandoned, and the group of twelve to fifteen people began walking in a direction, led vaguely by Daniel, who was talking into his phone. Laura slung an arm around Paulâs shoulder and said âPaulâ loudly and that she was going to slap him if the party wasnât good and asked for a cigarette. Paul said he didnât smoke and Laura walked away. After around ten blocks Daniel moved his phone away from his head and told Paulâand three or four other people within rangeâthat theyâd walked in the wrong direction. Paul said someone needed to make an announcement because the group, which wasnât stopping, was too large for information to spread naturally to itself. âWe walked the wrong way,â shouted Mitch. âStop walking. We walked the wrong way.â

People scattered a little, on the sidewalk, looking at their phones, seeming confused but surprisingly calm, except Lauraâs friend Walter, who was moving an unopened Red Bull Soda in arcs through the air, as if wielding it, while sometimes saying âwhatâs the address of the party?â to seemingly no one, with an agitated expression, then abruptly walked away, followed by Laura.

âWait,â said Paul, and hit her shoulder with a chopping motion while intending to touch it lightly. Laura briefly turned only her headâshe was frowningâwhile continuing to walk away. Paul went with Daniel and Mitch to the other party, which they found after around forty minutes, when everyone else had gone home, to bars, or sheepishly back to Kyle and Gabbyâs party.



â¢ â¢ â¢



When Paul woke, the next afternoon, Laura, 28, had already friended and messaged him on Facebook. She had a MySpace page, as an unsigned rapper, with six songs, including one whose music video, in which she rubs pizza on her face and feeds pizza to her cat, Paul remembered feeling highly amused and impressed by when he first saw it, when it had âgone viral,â to some degree, one or two years ago. In the library, that night, Paul discovered Gabby had defriended him on Facebook and was surprised that Kyle, his closest friend the past two years, except the nine months he was with Michelle, had also defriended him and that both had unfollowed him on Twitter.

The next night, outside Taco Chulo, a Mexican restaurant in Williamsburg, Laura apologized for being late and said sheâd gotten lost on the walk from her apartment, eight blocks away. Paul asked if she wanted to eat at Lodge, which had âgood chicken fingers,â or Taco Chulo, as theyâd previously agreed, and she seemed confused. In Taco Chulo a waiter said to sit âanywhere.â Paul watched Laura move very slowly, in a kind of exploring, it seemed, as if through darkness, to arrive at a four-person table, where once seated, with a slightly desperate expression, not looking at Paul, she focused on signaling a waiter. Paul also focused on signaling a waiter. Laura ordered a margarita, then sometimes turned her head 90 degrees, to her right, to stare outsideâat the sidewalk, or the quiet streetâwith a self-consciously worried expression, seeming disoriented and shy in a distinct, uncommon manner indicating to Paul an underlying sensation of âtotal yet failingâ (as opposed to most peopleâs âpartial and successfulâ) effort, in terms of the social interaction but, it would often affectingly seem, also generally, in terms of existing. Paul had gradually recognized this demeanor, the past few years, as characteristic, to some degree, of every person, maybe since middle school, with whom heâd been able to form a friendship or enter a relationship (or, it sometimes seemed, earnestly interact and not feel alienated or insane). After finishing a second margarita Laura became attentive and direct, like sheâd been at the party, when she had been probably very drunk, Paul realized.

âYou have a girlfriend?â said Laura, surprised.

âNo,â said Paul, confused. âWhy?â

âYou said âmy girlfriend.â â

Paul said he meant âex-girlfriend.â Laura said sheâd thought he was âa Gaylord,â because at the party heâd been surrounded by males, which someone had called his âfans.â Paul said the party was âlike, seventy percent malesâ and that he had always thought the word âGaylordâ had been invented by someone in middle school for derogatory purposes by combining âgayâ and âlord.â When he showed Laura prints of his art (which, according to StatCounter, sheâd already seen on one of his websites), she seemed to reflexively feign seeing them for the first time: her eyes, upon sight, became and remained slightly unfocused and she made a noise indicating she was seeing something new, but when he asked if sheâd seen them before she said âyeah,â but seemed to continue feigning âno.â Paul, endeared by her extreme and complicated helplessness, took back his art and focused conversation on other topics. They agreed to leave, but continued talking for around forty-five minutes, inviting each other to parties that weekend. Paul felt a kind of panic when they realized the parties were the same night and said âI donât know what to doâ and âmaybe they arenât on the same night.â Laura said they could go to both partiesâwhich seemed immediately obviousâand asked if Paul wanted to go to K&M, where her friend was DJ-ing. Paul carefully said he did, then went to the bathroom, thinking that for matters involving social interaction he shouldnât trust himself, at this time, after being mostly alone for around four months.



In K&Mâempty except for the DJ, bartender, two other peopleâthey each drank two shots of tequila and sat with glasses of beer in a booth, side by side, facing a giant screen showing Half Baked on mute with subtitles. Laura complimented Paulâs hair and level of âcasualnessâ and, going partially under the table, held a candle toward Paulâs shoesâwhich from Paulâs above-table perspective felt stationary and storage-oriented as shoe boxesâasking what brand they were.

âiPath,â said Paul.

âI canât see. What are these?â

âiPath. The brand is iPath.â

âI like them,â said Laura.

âiPath,â said Paul quietly.

Laura said her ex-boyfriend was in a band and used heroin and they already stopped seeing each other, but it was âongoing,â for example he asked her to a movie last week and she went and it was awkward. âI just wish he would disappear,â she said in a sincere-seeming manner, staring at Half Baked, which Paul saw on her right eye as four to six pixels that sometimes changed colors. Laura said she didnât want to talk about her ex-boyfriend. Paul asked if sheâd tried heroin and she said no, but liked painkillers, then nuzzled his shoulder with her head. When he said he had a headache and drugs in his room and asked if she wanted to go there, she seemed instantly distracted (as a reflexive tactic, Paul felt, to not appear too eager) and expressed indecision a few minutes, then said she also had a headache, then directly stated, more than onceâin an openly and uncaringly, Paul felt with amusement, confirmation-seeking manner indicating her previous indecision was at least partly feignedâthat she wanted to go to Paulâs room to ingest his drugs.



Outside, after fifteen minutes of failing to get a taxi, they began walking purposelessly, both saying they didnât know the correct direction to Paulâs apartment, maybe twenty blocks away. Paulâs arms felt more tired, from signaling taxis, than âin five years, maybe,â he estimated aloud. They got in a minivan taxi, which after a few minutes dropped them off near the center of a shadowy, tree-heavy intersection.

The address was correct, according to the street sign, but Paul didnât recognize anything, even after turning two full circles while dimly aware, in a detached manner reminding him of his drunkenness, that his behaviorâs dizzying effects might be counterproductive. He heard Laura, somewhat obligatorily, he thought, say she was scared, then said he was a little scared, then in a louder voice, as if correcting himself, said he was confused. His inability to recognize anything began to feel like a failure of imagination, an inability to process information creatively. His conscious, helpless, ongoing lack of recognitionâhis shrinking, increasingly vague contextâseemed exactly and boringly like how it would feel to die, or to have died. He felt like he was disappearing. He was aware of having said âis there another Humboldt Street, or something,â when he realized he wasâalready, without a feeling or memory of recognitionâlooking at the bronze gate, thirty to forty feet away, of the walkway to the four-story house in which, in an apartment on the second floor, he shared a bathroom and kitchen with Caroline, an administrative assistant at the New School with an MFA in poetry.

In Paulâs room Laura tried to identify some of his fifteen to twenty pills and tablets, mostly from Charles, who had mailed them before leaving for Mexico, with her phone but the internet wasnât working. Paulâs MacBook, which heâd spilled iced coffee on, was in Kansas being affordably repaired. Laura swallowed two of what Paul knew was Tylenol 3. Paul swallowed a Percocet and, somewhat arbitrarily, he felt, three Advil, then turned off the light, saying it was hurting his headache.

Paul was aware, as they lay kissing in the dark on his mattress, of Laura petting his upper arm in a manner that seemed independent of their kissing (but, he dimly intuited, because they were of the same source, must be discernibly related, on some level, if only as contributors to some larger system). Laura wanted to continue kissing but couldnât breathe, she said, because her nose was stuffy. âIâm sorry, I donât want to be needy,â she said a few minutes later. âBut I canât sleep without noise, like a fan.â Paul turned on the bathroom vent. Caroline turned it off a few minutes later. Paul turned it on and texted Caroline his situation and that he would pay five dollars to keep it on tonight.



Paul woke on his back, with uncomfortably warm feet, in a bright room, not immediately aware who or where he was, or how he had arrived. Most mornings, with decreasing frequency, probably only because the process was becoming unconscious, he wouldnât exactly know anything until three to twenty seconds of passive remembering, as if by unzipping a fileânewroom.zipâinto a PDF, showing his recent history and narrative context, which heâd delete after viewing, thinking that before he slept again he would have memorized this period of his life, but would keep newroom.zip, apparently not trusting himself.

visit parents again?



Paulâs father was 28 and Paulâs mother was 24 when they alone (out of a combined fifteen to twenty-five siblings) left Taiwan for America. Paul was born in Virginia six years later, in 1983, when his brother was 7. Paul was 3 when the family moved to Apopka, a pastoral suburb near Orlando, Florida.

Paul cried the first day of preschool for around ten minutes after his mother, who was secretly watching and also crying, seemed to have left. It was their first time apart. Paulâs mother watched as the principal cajoled Paul into interacting with his classmates, among whom he was well liked and popular, if a bit shy and âdisengaged, sometimes,â said one of the high school students who worked at the preschool, which was called the Discovery Center. Each day, after that, Paul cried less and transitioned more abruptly from crying to interacting with classmates, and by the middle of the second week he didnât cry anymore. At home, where mostly only Mandarin was spoken, Paul was loud and either slug-like or, his mother would say in English, âhyperactive,â rarely walking to maneuver through the house, only crawling, rolling like a log, sprinting, hopping, or climbing across sofas, counters, tables, chairs, etc. in a game called âdonât touch the ground.â Whenever motionless and not asleep or sleepy, lying on carpet in sunlight, or in bed with eyes open, bristling with undirectionalized momentum, he would want to intensely sprint in all directions simultaneously, with one unit of striving, never stopping. He would blurrily anticipate this unimaginably worldward action, then burst off his bed to standing position, or make a loud noise and violently spasm, or jolt from the carpet into a sprint, flailing his arms, feeling always incompletely satisfied.

Paulâs first grade teacher recommended he be placed in the English-as-second-language program, widely viewed as for âimpairedâ students, but Paulâs mother kept him in the normal class. His second grade teacher recommended he be tested for the âgiftedâ program and he was admitted and began going every Friday to gifted, in which most of the twenty-five to thirty students, having begun in first grade, were already friends. Paul felt alone on Fridays, but not lonely or uncomfortable or anxious, only that he was in a new and challenging situation without assistance or consequence for failureâa feeling not unlike playing a difficult Nintendo game alone, with no instruction manual. Paul played chess one Friday with Barry, who suggested Paulâs second move. Barry knew more about chess, so was being helpful, Paul thought, and did as suggested for his third move also, then watched an extremely happy Barry dash through the rectangular classroom telling groups of classmates heâd beaten Paul in a four-move check-mate. Paul told three classmates Barry had âtricked him,â then returned to the floor and put the chess pieces away and, with a sensation of seeing a spider crawl out of view inside his room, felt himself reassimilating Barry into the world as a kind of robot-like presence he would always need to be careful around and would never comprehend. In third grade, one morning, Paul finished telling something to his friend Chris, who was strangely unresponsive for a few seconds, then with an exaggeratedly disgusted expression told Paul his breath smelled âhorribleâ and âbrush your teeth,â then turned 180 degrees, in his seat, to talk to someone else. Paul mechanically committed to always brushing his teeth and adjusted his view of Chris to include him, with Barry and 90 to 95 percent of people heâd met, as separate and unknowable.

In fourth grade, Paul spent two days with Lori, a second grader in his neighborhood. Lori kissed Paulâs cheek in a tree, then in her room showed him a Mickey Mantle card from her father, whoâd said Mickey Mantle had the record for most RBIs. Paul, who collected baseball cards, said Hank Aaron had the record for most RBIs. Lori said he was probably right, because he was really smart. At dusk, the next day, rollerblading on the longest street in the neighborhood, Lori said she needed to try harder than Paul to go the same speed, because her legs were shorter, which Paul thought was insightful.

Entering middle school, sixth to eighth grade, Paul wanted to play percussion like three of his friends, including his âbest friend,â Hunter, but his piano teacher said percussion would bore him, so he chose trumpet, which he disliked, but continued playing until the summer before high school, when he switched to percussion on the first day of âband camp,â which was ten hours of practice every weekday for two weeks. During lunch break, that day, Paul was practicing alone by silently counting and sometimes tapping a cymbal with a soft-headed mallet when a senior percussionist, the section leader, began teasing him from across the room, saying he was âso coolâ and something about his baggy jeans, which his skateboarding brother, at college in Philadelphia, had left in Florida. Paul was unable to think anything, except that he didnât know what to do, at all, so he committed to doing nothing, which the senior incorporated into his teasing by focusing on how Paul was âtoo coolâ to react, continuing for maybe thirty seconds before commenting briefly on Paulâs hair and leaving the room.

Believing that all the seniorâs friends and acquaintances, which included almost every person at band camp, now viewed his main effort in life as wanting to be âcool,â which he did want, to some degree, but which now seemed impossible, Paul became increasingly, physically, exclusively critically, nearly continuously self-conscious, the next few days, in ways he hadnât been beforeâbut probably had been in latent development since preschoolâand which affected his musicianship. His middle school friends, including Hunter, among whom heâd been most fearless and at least equally competent at whatever sport or video game, watched him fail every day to play the simplest parts, usually tambourine or triangle, of each piece. The percussion instructor that year punished everyone with push-ups if one person, usually Paul, played something incorrectly more than once. Paulâs friendsâsubtly, then openly, with confusion and frustrationâbegan to express disbelief at Paulâs inability to count to a number and hit a cowbell or cymbal. Paul was too embarrassed, by the end of the first week, to speak to his friendsâall of whom seemed to have easily befriended the section leader and other upperclassmenâand by the second week had begun committing, in certain situations, to not speaking unless asked a question.

Two months into freshman year he had committed to not speaking in almost all situations. He felt ashamed and nervous around anyone whoâd known him when he was popular and unself-conscious. When he heard laughter, before he could think or feel anything, his heart would already be beating like heâd sprinted twenty yards. As the beating slowly normalized heâd think of how his heart, unlike him, was safely contained, away from the world, behind bone and inside skin, held by muscles and arteries in its place, carefully off-center, as if to artfully assert itself as source and creator, having grown the chest to hide in and to muffle and absorbâand, later, after innovating the brain and face and limbs, to convert into productive behaviorâits uncontrollable, indefensible, unexplainable, embarrassing squeezing of itself. To avoid awkwardness, and in respect of his apparent aversion to speaking, Paulâs classmates stopped including him in conversations. The rare times he spokeâin classes where no one knew him, or when, without knowing why, for one to forty minutes, heâd become aggressively confident and spontaneous as heâd been in elementary/middle school, about which his friends poignantly would always seem genuinely excitedâheâd feel âout of character,â indicating heâd completed a transformation and was now, in a humorlessly surreal way, exactly what he didnât want to be and wished he wasnât.

He ate lunch alone, on benches far from the cafeteria, listening to musicâhis sort of refuge that was like a tunneling in his desolation toward a greater desolation, further from others and himself, closer to the shared source of everythingâwith portable CD players and earphones, feeling sorry for himself, or vaguely but deeply humbled, though mostly just silent and doomed. Sometimes, thinking of how among fifteen hundred classmates only two others, that heâd noticed, were as socially inept as heâa male in his grade, an obese male one grade lowerâPaul would feel a blandly otherworldly excitement, like he must be in some bizarre and extended dream, or lost in the offscreen world of some fictional movie set in an adjacent county.

In Paulâs sophomore or junior year he began to believe the only solution to his anxiety, low self-esteem, view of himself as unattractive, etc. would be for his mother to begin disciplining him on her own volition, without his prompting, as an unpredictableâand, maybe, to counter the previous fourteen or fifteen years of âoverprotectiveness,â unfairâentity, convincingly not unconditionally supportive. His mother would need to create rules and punishments exceeding Paulâs expectations, to a degree that Paul would no longer feel in control. To do this, Paul believed, his mother would need to anticipate and preempt anything he might have considered, factoring in thatâbecause Paul was thinking about this almost every day, and between the two of them was the source of this beliefâhe probably already expected, or had imagined, any rule or punishment she would be willing to instate or inflict, therefore she would need to consider rules and punishments that she would not think of herself as willing to instate or inflict. Paul tried to convey this in crying, shouting fights with his mother lasting up to four hours, sometimes five days a week. There was an inherent desperation to these fights, in that each time Paul, in frustration, told his mother how she could have punished him, in whatever previous situation, to make him feel not in controlâto, he believed, help solve his social and psychological problemsâit became complicatedly more difficult, in Paulâs view, for his mother to successfully preempt his expectations the next time. Paul cried and shouted more than his mother, who only shouted maybe once or twice. Paul would scream if his mother was downstairs while he was upstairs, in his room, where some nights he would throw his electric pencil sharpener and textbooksâand, once, a six-inch cymbalâat his walls, creating holes, resulting in punishments, but never exceeding what, by imagining their possibilities, heâd already rendered unsurprising, predictable. The intensity of these fights maybe contributed to Paulâs lungs collapsing spontaneously three times his senior year, when he was absent forty-seven days and in hospitals for around four weeks.

One night, standing in the doorway of his parentsâ bedroom, when his father was on a months-long business trip, crying while shouting at his mother, who was supine in bed, in the dark, Paul heard her softly and steadily crying, with her blanket up to her chin in a way that seemed child-like. Paul stopped shouting and stood sobbing quietly, dimly aware, as his face twitched and trembled, that he felt intensely embarrassed of himself from the perspective of any person, except his mother, he had ever met. He said he didnât know what he was talking about, or what he should do, that he was sorry and didnât want to complain or blame other people anymore, and felt an ambiguous relief, to have reached the end of a thing without resolution and, having tried hard, feeling allowedâand readyâto resign. He didnât stop blaming his mother, after that, but gradually they fought lessâand, after each fight, when he would revert to his belief about discipline, he would apologize and reiterate he didnât want to blame anyone or complainâand, by the last month of senior year, had mostly stopped fighting.

On one of Paulâs last days of high school he and Lori were both getting rides home from Hunter, who due to a difficulty in refusing requests from people who could see himâin elementary/middle school, whenever a mutual friend rang his doorbell, he and Paul would pretend no one was homeâ sometimes spent ninety minutes driving classmates home after school. The past eight years, since Lori kissed Paul on the cheek, theyâd spoken maybe three times (the day after they rollerbladed together she had begun hanging out with a boy with a ârattailâ hairstyle), and the most intimate Paul had been with another girl was a ten-minute conversation, at an âawayâ high school football game, with another percussionist.

Lori repeatedly asked Paul why he wouldnât speak and, not receiving an answer, began provoking Paul to âsay anything,â seeming as committed to eliciting a response as Paul was to not responding. Lori was loudly asking, with genuine and undistracted and bemused curiosity, which Paul felt affection toward and admired, as he stared away from her, out his window, why he couldnât speakâand if he could just âmake any noiseââwhen Hunter, whoâd been talking to someone in the front passenger seat, sort of forced Lori to stop by aggressively asking about her current boyfriend. As he had consistently, the past eight to ten years, Paul felt endeared by Hunter, who used to be an equal, but nowâand for the past three or four yearsâwas like an overworked stepfather or sensitive uncle to Paul, the mentally disabled stepson or silent, troubling nephew.



Paul hadnât seen Laura since she slept over, five days ago, when he brought a mix CD and Ambien to her room, which was more than half occupied by a full-size bed. She offered him red wine she was drinking from a wineglass and typed âsex tiger woodsâ into Google and clicked dlisted.com. Adjacent to a photo of Tiger Woods, smiling on a golf course, were blocks of text, in which âAmbien sex hazeâ was in bold around ten times.

Laura typed âambientâ into Google.

âNo,â said Paul grinning. âThatâs the music, delete the t.â

Laura laughed and typed âambien and alcohol and klonopin andâ and grinned at Paul and, though she had a Klonopin prescription, Paul knew, and was probably on Klonopin, said âjust kiddingâ and deleted all but âambien and alcohol.â Every result, it seemed, warned strongly against combining Ambien and alcohol, but Laura said she drank âa lot,â so it would be okay. Paul crawled onto her bed and touched her cat Jeffrey and, after a vague amount of time, became aware of a slight blurriness to his vision, like he was seeing from two perspectives in time, milliseconds apart, and that he felt vaguely sleepy and not nervous. He asked if Laura could turn off the light, which seemed uncomfortably bright. He felt confused, to some degree, by everything, but at a delay, as if continuously realizing past confusions, which could no longer be resolved, so were not problems. They seemed to be watching a foreign movie off her computer, then Paul noticed the light was on and that they were lying against a mound of blankets, kissing lazily, with eyes closed and long pauses, maybe sometimes asleep. He became aware of his mix CD, of some of his favorite songs, sounding unpleasantly, almost nightmarishly, noise-like. Paul realized they were trying to undo his belt and weakly imagined what would happen if his jeans were removed and heard Laura say âwe just metâ from what seemed like a nearby, inaccessible distance and wondered if he was asleep, or dreaming, but knew he was awake, because he was moving physically. He was trying to remove Lauraâs clothing. He felt like he was trying to remove the surface of a glass bottle by pawing at it with oven mitts. He expressed confusion and Laura said âitâs just a skirt . . . and tightsâ and stopped moving completely, it seemed, as Paul continued touching her strange outfit with hands that felt glossy and fingerless, suspecting at one point, with some sarcasm, that she was wearing a corset.

âItâs been two hours, I think,â said Paul after staring at his phone around ten seconds. âJesus,â he said, and sneezed.



Entering Lucieâs party, an hour and a half later, Paul felt like if he wasnât careful he would fall in an out-of-control, top-heavy manner toward whomever he was greeting and hurt himself and multiple others by reflexively grabbing people and pulling them down with him in a continuing effort to remain standing. He realized he might be unconsciously hunching his back, to be nearer the floor, when Lucie, though four or five inches shorter, appeared to be above him as she thanked him for linking her magazine on his blog. Paul introduced Lucie and other people to Laura by saying âthis is Lauraâ a few times without looking at anyoneâs face, while moving toward areas with less people. âHey,â said Paul, as he passed Mitch in a crowded space, and mumbled something about âgoing somewhere,â which in combination with a peremptory nodding was meant to convey they would definitely talk at length, later tonight, since they hadnât seen each other in a long timeâmonths, maybe.

In an empty kitchen, a few seconds later, Paul realized Mitch, who worked for Zipcar, had driven him and Lauraâand othersâto this party. Paul stared into a refrigerator, bent at his waist, waiting for himself, it seemed, to think or do something. âTrying to choose two beers,â he thought after a vague amount of time, and chose two at random, then found Laura and went with her through a window, onto a fourth-story roof, where they passed a shadowy area, emanating the language-y noises and phantom heat of four to six people, to a higher area, where they were alone. Paul, dangling his legs briefly off the building, scooted backward, passively cooperative, as a distracted-seeming Laura pulled him away from the edge. They sat facing hundreds of the same type of four-story building, the expanse of which, in most directions, darkened dramatically, creating an illusion that one could see the Earthâs curvature, until blurring, in the distance, into a texture. Sometimes, looking at a city, especially a gray or brown one, at night, Paul would intuitively view it as a small and irreducible thing that arrived one summer and rapidly grew, showing patterns of color on its expanding surface, then was discolored by autumn and removed of its exterior and deadened by winter, in preparation for regrowth, in spring, but was unable, in its form, to enter the natural cycle, so continued growing, in a manner as if faceless and skinless, through summer, autumn, etc., less in belligerence or tyranny, or with some abstruse knowledge of its own rightness, than as a stranded thing, sightless and uninstructed, with an objectless sort of yearning. Seeing the streets and bridges and sidewalks, while living inside a building, locked in a room, one could forget that it was all a single, alien, seeking entity.

Paul realized he and Laura had been staring into the distanceâunaware of each other, it seemedâfor maybe two or three minutes. He looked at her profile. Without moving her head, in a voice like she was still considering if this was true, she said Paul was âdeviousâ for bringing her to a party where another girl liked him.

âWhat girl likes me?â

âLucie,â said Laura after a few seconds, still staring ahead, systematically reinterpreting her and Paulâs prior interactions, it seemed, with this new information.

âWhy do you think she likes me?â

âI can tell,â said Laura, and lit a cigarette.

âShe has a boyfriend,â said Paul.

Laura said something seemingly unrelated about cooking.

âYou should cook for me,â said Paul distractedly.

âYou wonât like itâitâll be dense and unhealthy.â

âI like pasta and lasagna,â said Paul, and thought he heard Laura ask if his computer was in Canada and was nervous she might be confusing him for another person. âWhat computer?â

âYou said your computer was getting fixed in Canada.â

âOh,â said Paul. âKansas, not Canada. Yeah, itâs still there.â



On their way back inside Paul and Laura passed the shadowy area, from where an unseen Amy said something implying Laura had stolen her cigarettes, using the word âcuteâ antagonistically. Paul had an urge to accelerate, but Laura, ahead of him, continued at her leisurely pace, maneuvering carefully through the window, into the kitchen.

Paul followed a slow-moving Laura through a long, dark, almost boomerang-shaped hallway, which felt briefly room-like, as they sort of lingered in it, or like it wanted to be a room, with furniture and guests, but maybe was shy and too afraid of causing disappointment, so impaired itself with two conspicuous openings to conventionally shaped rooms, a sort of recommendation against itself. Paul and Laura entered a large room of sofas and tables and eight to twelve people, including Daniel, who encouraged Paul to âtest-driveâ a foot-massage machine, which was on the floor, audibly bubbling hot water.

âTake off your shoes and socks,â said Daniel.

âI donât want to use that,â said Paul, and turned around and distractedly sat on a backless, deeply padded, uncomfortable seat, which yielded at least a foot from Paulâs weight. Laura was ten feet away, in a throne-like chair, facing Paul, but not looking at him, or anyone, it seemed. Paul openly stared at her for around ten seconds, to no response, then moved chips and guacamole onto his lap (partly because he felt anxious about Laura seeming to refuse to look at him) and focused on steadily eating while repeatedly thinking âeating chips and guacamole.â He looked at his hands, and felt his mouth and throat, doing what he was thinking, and felt vaguely confused. Was he instructing his brain? Or was he narrating what he saw and felt?

Laura seemed less distracted, but more worried, than before. Paul moved toward her with what felt like a precariously sustained gliding motion and sat against and above her, on the chairâs sturdy armrest, in a comically awkward manner he hadnât foreseen and was preparing to reverse, by returning to his seat, when Laura lifted his arm and placed it ungently around her neckâmaybe a little disappointed that she had to do it herselfâwhere it remained, independent and heavy as a small boa constrictor, for a vague amount of time, during which Paul, remaining almost completely still, felt increasingly reluctant to move, or speak. At some point, maybe three minutes later, Paul asked if Laura wanted to go to the other party.

âYes,â she said.



Paul felt like parts of his and Lauraâs bodies, as they stood on the front stoop hugging tightly under one umbrella, waiting for Walterâs car, were oppositely charged magnets covered with thick velvet. Paul crawled into Walterâs carâs backseat, spilling red wine; unable to find the cork, he wrapped the bottle in a plastic bag. He faced ahead, seated between two people, and realized no one had cared, or noticed, at all, it seemed, about the wine. Paul thought âIâm in hellâ when people began to loudly mimic the guitar parts of the Led Zeppelin playing from a tape deck, resulting mostly in demonic-sounding noises and a kind of metallic, nightmarish screeching. Paul couldnât discern if they did this regularly, or if it had just been improvised. âAmbien has a negative effect on music for me,â he thought.

At Lauraâs friendâs party Paul sat alone at the snacks table, eating crackers and drinking wine, sometimes with unfocused eyes. Then he was sitting on a mattress in a space-module-like bedroom, in which six to ten people, smoking marijuana, watched a video off a MacBook of obese people screaming in pain earnestly while exercising and being screamed at motivationally, in what seemed to be a grotesque parody, or something, of something. Paul felt strong aversion to the video, and also like heâd already experienced this exact situationâhe remembered his aversion to the video and the way someone to his right was laughingâand wanted to ask if this already happened, but didnât know who to ask, then realized he wanted to ask himself. Around an hour later, after more crackers and wine, Paul thought he heard Laura drunkenly say something like âlet him through, my new boyfriend,â loud enough for probably ten to fifteen people to have heard, as she beckoned him to sit with her and her three closest friends, including Walter, on a four-seat sofa. Walter drove everyone on the sofa to Lauraâs apartment to smoke marijuana, around 3:30 a.m., when the party ended.

On the sidewalk, outside Lauraâs apartment, a heavily impaired Paul explained that in high school his lungs collapsed three times and one of the doctors said smoking marijuana would increase the chance of recurrence by 4,200 percent. Laura said he wouldnât have to smoke. Paul said the smoke would be in the air and that he was allergic to Lauraâs cat and had a horrible headache. He hugged Laura, then walked toward the Bedford L train station, half a block away.

The next night Laura emailed that she wished Paul wasnât allergic to Jeffrey so he could be with her, in her room, listening to the rain. Paul asked if she wanted to eat dinner together tomorrow night. Laura said she felt like she missed him and âwell, I guess Iâll see you tomorrow,â characteristically answering a question indirectly and ending an email casually.

Paul was aware he felt mysteriously less interested in her after reading that she felt like she missed him and realized he hadnât considered what a relationship between them would be like: probably not sustainable, at all, due to a mutual lack of strong interest. He was aware of not acknowledging her line about missing him in his response, which included a short list of restaurants he liked.



Paul met Laura the next night outside the clothing boutique in SoHo where she worked. âI think this is a bad idea, I always go home after work to nap,â she said with a worried expression, walking slowly away from Paul, who signaled a taxi, which they exited fifteen blocks later at a deli, where they bought a 40oz and two bottles of beer.

Seated, in Angelica Kitchen, they looked at each other directly for the first time that night. Laura seemed anxious and tired. Paul said the restaurant was organic and vegan and Laura said she had been trying to eat better since meeting Paul, who grinned while saying âyouâve been trying to eat butter?â twice, during which Laura began to blush.

âI thought you said âbutter,â â said Paul grinning.

Laura looked at her hand touching a fork on the table.

âI thought you said youâre trying to eat butter.â

âStop,â said Laura moving the fork slowly toward herself.

âStop what?â

âYouâre making fun of me, I think,â said Laura looking at him tentatively.

âNo, Iâm not. I wouldnât do that.â

Laura was motionless, looking at her lap with downcast eyes, like she was waiting for Paul to finish. Paul asked if she believed him and she didnât respond and he felt stranded and withering and asked again if she believed him, then quietly said âI honestly thought you said âbutter.â â He nervously moved a spoon to his lap and, aware they were both looking down, felt himself absorbing the irresolution of the butter misunderstanding as an irreversible damage. He asked if she wanted to leave, for a different restaurant maybe. Laura poured beer from the 40oz into Paulâs glass, already 95 percent full, and said âletâs just drink more, I just need to drink moreâ and apologized for âbeing like this.â

âItâs okay,â said Paul. âIâm sorry about the butter thing.â

Laura blushed and looked down by slowly moving her eyeballs. Paul apologized and said he wouldnât talk about it anymore and that he liked Lauraâs eyebrows, which were black, in contrast to her naturally blond hair. They talked tensely, with a few long pauses, about the difference between Scottish and Irish people and Paul began to worry about the rest of dinner, but after they finished the 40oz and mutely focused on their menus a few minutes they settled into a calm, polite, somewhat resigned manner of leisurely occupying each other. When their mashed potatoes, chili, corn-bread, noodle soup arrived they talked less and Paul began to feel a little sleepy. Laura thanked him for showing her this restaurant, which she wanted to try lunch from soon.



Outside, on the sidewalk, Laura immediately walked toward the 1st Avenue L train station at an unleisurely pace, seeming less rushed than resolutely continuing with a prior, focused, unobstructed momentum. Paul realized, with some confusion, that heâd obliviously assumed they would do something together after dinner; more than once, as they waited for the bill, heâd considered suggesting they see a movie at a theater that was in the opposite direction they were currently walking. Laura was crossing streets and sidewalks at unconventional angles, as if across a field, in a diagonal, it seemed, to get there sooner. Paul wanted to stop moving and sit or lay on the sidewalk, partly as a juvenile tactic to interrupt Lauraâs departure.

On the train Laura became significantly more talkative and, it seemed, happier. Paul thought of how at every job heâd had, in movie theaters and libraries and restaurants, almost every employee, probably especially himself, would become predictably friendlier and more generous as closing time neared. At the Bedford station, before exiting the train, Laura apologized again and unsolicitedly said âmaybe Iâll feel better and come over later, in a few hours,â which seemed to Paul like a non sequitur, or an extreme example of the âclosing timeâ effect.



In his room, with the light on, Paul lay entirely beneath his blanket, aware that Michelle was the last person whoâd affected him this cripplinglyâto zero productivity, not even listening to music, motionless between his blanket and mattress like some packaged thing. He heard a ringing noise, or the memory of a ringing noise, which meant another of his limited number of nonregenerative hearing cells had died, though his room was nearly silent. He became aware of himself remembering a night when he and Michelle, alone in her motherâs mansion-like house in Pittsburgh, made salad and pasta for dinner and sat facing each other, bisecting a long wood table like a converted canoe. Paul had begun to feel depressed without knowing whyâmaybe unconsciously intuiting what life would be like in a giant house with a significant other and a routine, how forty or fifty years, like windows on a computer screen, maximized on top of each other, could appear like a single year that would then need to be lived repeatedly, so that one felt both nearer and withheld from deathâand within a few minutes was silent and visibly troubled, staring down at his salad. Michelle had asked what was wrong and Paul had said ânothing,â then sheâd asked again and heâd said he felt depressed, but didnât know why, then at some point she went upstairs, where Paul found her on her bed, in her room that seemed too big for one person, in a fetal position on her sideâoval and exposed, on top of her sheets and blanket, as an egg. Paul dreamed something about his cube-shaped room being a storage facility in which heâd been placed by an entity that believed in his resale value. While in storage he could interact with others, look at the internet, go on a book tour, but if he damaged himself he would be moved to a garbage pile, on a different planet. He woke a few times, then remained awake, obstructed from sleep by his own grumpiness and discomfort, the main reasons he wanted to sleep.

He reached outside his blanket and pulled his MacBook âdarkly,â he felt, toward himself, like an octopus might. It was 12:52 a.m., almost three hours since leaving Angelica Kitchen. Laura, to Paulâs surprise, had emailed twiceâa few sentence fragments apologizing for her awkwardness at 11:43 p.m., a paragraph of elaboration at 12:05 a.m. Paul emailed that he understood and liked her and thought she was âcool.â She responded, a few minutes later, seeming cheerful. After a few more emails she seemed almost âgiddy.â They committedâearnestly and enthusiastically, Paul feltâto get tattoos together tomorrow.

Laura arrived around 4:30 p.m., seeming tired and distracted, with cheese and a bottle of wine and knitting materials in a plastic bag. Paul said they should go to Manhattan before night and Laura asked why and Paul said for tattoos. Laura said she wanted to stay inside to work on her set of a dozen âmonster masks,â which she wanted to use in a music video for one of her songs (and which, based on photos Paul had seen on the internet, she seemed to have been knitting for more than a year). They shared a Klonopin, and when it began to get dark outside Paul suggested a restaurant two blocks away, but Laura didnât want to go outside, so they ordered Chinese foodâminnow-size pieces of slippery chicken in a shiny garlic sauce, six fortune cookiesâand ate only a little, then shared an Ambien and sat, at a distance from each other, on Paulâs mattress.

Paul patted the area beside him and Laura said âstop trying to make sexy timeâ in an earnest, slightly annoyed voice. Paul grinned and honestly said he wasnât and felt confused. Laura, who had finished most of the bottle of wine herself, lay curled in a corner of the mattress and was soon asleep. Paul absently looked at the internet a little, then woke, three hours later, around midnight, to Laura putting her things into her plastic bag. She was going home, she said, because she had to feed Jeffrey and had work in the morning.



The next night Paul was with Mitch and Mattâanother classmate from Florida, one year ahead of Mitch and Paul, currently âon vacationâ aloneâat Barcade, a bar with dozens of arcade machines. After one beer Paul texted Laura âhi, howâs it goingâ and interpreted her almost instantaneous response of âsuperâ as her wanting to finish an undesirable task as quick as possible. Paul texted he was at Barcade with âhigh school friendsâ and if Laura wanted to come. Laura texted âIâm all out of quartersâ after five minutes. Paul texted âI have some quarters for youâ with a neutral expression and a cringing sensation, then showed Mitch and Matt the texts, saying he felt depressed. Mattâs friend Lindsay (whom he was staying with while on vacation) arrived and everyone walked six blocks to a bar with outdoor Ping-Pong tables. Daniel arrived with his friend Fran, 22, whose intriguing gaze, Paul noticed with interest, seemed both disbelieving and transfixed in discernment, as if meticulously studying what she knew she was hallucinating. Paul looked at his phoneâit had been more than an hour since he texted Laura that he had quarters and, as expected, she hadnât respondedâand heard Daniel say âa Mexican placeâ and something about âsix tacosâ to Mitch.

âEight tacos,â said Paul absently.

âI said six tacos,â said Daniel.

âSix tacos,â said Paul. âWas it, like . . . a taco platter?â

âNo. This place has small tacos.â

âIt wasnât a taco platter?â

âIt wasnât a taco platter,â said Daniel.

âI donât get it,â said Paul without thinking.

âBro,â said Daniel grinning.

Paul asked Fran what she had eaten.

âEnchiladas,â said Fran.

âI can never remember what those are,â said Paul, and went to the bathroom. When he returned Lindsay invited everyone to her Cinco de Mayo partyâin five days, at her apartmentâthen everyone, except Fran, who Daniel said was an undergrad at Columbia and had left to do homework, walked eight blocks to a bar called Harefield Road to meet a group of people Paul knew as acquaintances from his involvement in poetry. Seconds after sitting in the outdoor area Paul openly said âI want to comfort myself with foodâ without looking at anyone, in a relatively loud voice, with a bleak sensation of unsatisfying catharsis from having accurately, he felt, expressed himself. âIâm just going to eat whatever tonight,â he said, and stood, asking if anyone knew about food options at this bar. Two acquaintances said there were, at this time, around 2:30 a.m., only paninis. One of Danielâs two suitemates, who said sheâd written an article about Paul and reviewed books anonymously for Kirkus, went with him to order a panini. Paul asked if she liked a baseball book, which she mentioned having reviewed, and she talked without pause for what seemed like ten minutes, during which Paul, staring at her calmly, thought âsheâs definitely drunkâ and ânormally I would be interested in her, to some degree, but currently Iâm obsessed with Lauraâ and âshe seems maybe focused on not appearing drunk, which is maybe affecting her perception of time, of how long and off-topic and incomprehensible her answer has become.â Paul carried his panini outside and âopenly exchanged witty banter while feeling severely depressed,â he thought while speaking to various acquaintances. One said sheâd met Paul, when he lived with Shawn Olive, at least three times. Paul said he didnât recognize her, but also had forgotten that heâd once lived with Shawn Olive. He ate half his panini and said it was unsatisfying and left the bar and returned with Tateâs cookies and Fig Newmans, which he offered to each person. He asked Lindsay what her roommate, whom sheâd been talking about, was doing. Lindsay said âsleeping, watching TV, or smoking weedâ and Paul said âwe should go to your apartment,â aware he was somewhat desperately, if maybe sarcastically, trying to direct his interest away from Laura, toward any girl he had not yet, but still could, meet tonight.

âThis barâs special feature: âpaninis until really late,â â said Paul to a drunk-looking acquaintance on the way out.



â¢ â¢ â¢



In Lindsayâs apartmentâs common room Paul sat eating Fig Newmans on one side of a five-seat sofa with Mitch and Daniel on the other side. Lindsayâs roommate was sleeping. Paul was vaguely aware, as he reread texts from Laura, of people pressuring Matt to smoke marijuana. Matt was standing alone in a corner of the roomâseeming in Paulâs peripheral vision like a figure in a horror movieâsaying things, as explanation for his choice not to smoke marijuana, about his grandfatherâs alcoholism. Paul half-unconsciously mumbled somethingâto himself, he feltâabout feeling thirsty and within a few seconds Matt was standing above him asking if he wanted water. After bringing him a glass of water Matt asked if Paul wanted to use his MacBook to look at the internet. Paul felt endeared to a degree thatâin combination with his distraught emotional state, and as he dwelled a few seconds on how Mattâs behavior was like the opposite of pressuring someone to smoke marijuanaâhe felt like crying. Matt returned with a large MacBook from the room he was sleeping in while on vacation.

âThank you,â said Paul smiling.

âYouâre very welcome,â said Matt.

âYouâre being really nice to me.â

âYouâre the guest here,â said Matt, and Paul gingerly asked if he âby chanceâ had an iPod cord, sensing he would enjoy further indulging an appreciative subject with his gratuitous helpfulness. Paul accepted Mattâs iPod cord with a sensation, he felt, of daintiness, which remained as he transferred mostly pop-punk songs from Mattâs MacBook to his iPod nano. Around 4:30 a.m., in his room, Paul bit a piece of a 150mg Seroquel and listened to songs he hadnât heard since high school, mostly the EP Look Forward to Failure by the Ataris. He woke at night fifteen hours later and, while showering, felt like he lived in a module attached to a spaceship far enough from any star to never experience daylight.



Three days later Paul exited the Graham L train station carrying beer and guacamole ingredients in a paper bag from Whole Foods for Lindsayâs Cinco de Mayo party. Sitting cross-legged on the sidewalk against a Thai restaurant was a girl with dyed-black hair. As Paul approached she looked up knowingly with an innocent, wary gaze.

âHi,â said Paul. âAre you Fran?â

âYeah,â said Fran.

âIâm Paul.â

âI know,â said Fran, and slowly closed her notebook.

âAre you doing homework?â

âMy friendâs homework.â

âNice,â said Paul staring transfixed at Franâs delicate and extreme gaze, like that of a skeleton with eyeballs, or a person with their face peeled off. Paul began talkingâslowly, before accelerating to a normal speedâabout how Daniel had sounded âreally drunkâ on the phone but had sent witty, insightful, elaborate texts of mostly long, elegant sentences. Fran said Daniel was like that when on Klonopin. Paul asked if he could have a Klonopin and Fran gave him one and looked to his left, where he was surprised to see Daniel standing in place, a few feet away, looking at Fran with the fixed, discerning, earnest gaze of a three-year-old processing information without considering utility or personal relevance. Paul asked Daniel how many Klonopin he had taken.

âFive,â said Daniel.

âJesus,â said Paul.

When Paul entered the party, ahead of Daniel and Fran, Lindsay wreathed a plastic snake around his head and pulled him toward a hallway designated for photographs. Paul mumbled the word âbathroomâ and walked away grinning into the kitchen, where Matt was standing alone, not apparently doing anything. Paul asked about his vacation. Matt said he drove a rental car without a plan to Maine and ate seafood in a restaurant alone, did other things alone. âIt was really good,â he said, and briefly displayed a haunted and irreducibly unenthusiastic expression before reaching for chips. Paul walked out of the kitchen and looked at Fran sitting alone on the sofa where heâd eaten Fig Newmans five days ago and returned to the kitchen and, while peripherally aware of a self-conscious Matt slowly creating guacamole, asked Daniel what heâd meantâin one of his dense, interesting textsâwhen he said he felt like thereâd been âstrange occurrences lately.â Daniel said he read all of Paulâs books last autumn while in San Francisco and told his friends he had a feeling that when he came to New York City he would meet Paul and they would become friends. Daniel was alert and expressionless as an advanced cyborg as he explained that heâd gone to Paul and Frederickâs reading because Amy didnât want to be alone with Lucie and that none of them had known Paul was reading.

âIâve felt similar things,â said Paul. âSince Kyleâs party, when I met Laura. Or, I mean, actually, the night before that, at the reading near Times Square, when we met.â

âHow do you feel about it?â

âAbout what?â

âIt,â said Daniel vaguely.

âIt seems good. New things keep happening, which seems good. I just felt right now like itâs going to end tonight.â

âYouâre pessimistic about it,â said Daniel as a neutral observation, staring intensely at Paul with a serious, almost grim expression.

âWe havenât referenced it until now.â

âIâm sorry for talking about it and causing you to think it might end,â said Daniel earnestly.

âItâs okay,â said Paul, a little confused. âMaybe it wonât end. But I wonder if we need to make an effort, for it to continue.â

âWell,â said Daniel hesitantly. âDonât you think it just needs to happen naturally?â

âYeah,â said Paul.

âWell, then we wouldnât make an effort, then, huh?â

âI mean if we need to keep doing things, instead of staying inside,â said Paul.

âYou said you only go to like one party a month. But youâre at almost every party.â

âThis isnât normal at all,â said Paul. âBefore we met I probably did less than one thing a month.â

âWhy do you think that is?â

âProbably because I met people I like.â

Daniel hesitated. âWhat people?â

âYou, Mitch, Laura . . . Amy,â said Paul. âIâm going to the bathroom.â When he returned Fran and Daniel were making guacamole energetically, with spoons and a mashing strategy, adding onion and cilantro and salsa and garlic powder, having apparently replaced Matt, who was very slowly, it seemed, moving a beer toward his mouth. Paul began eating guacamole as it was being made, with chips, to no discernible opposition. In a distracted voice, without looking at anyone, he asked if Daniel and Fran wanted to go to a âbook partyâ tomorrow night at a bookstore in Greenpoint and they seemed interested. Fran gave everyone vodka shots. Matt moved into a position facing more people and, with an earnest but powerless attempt at enthusiasm, resulting in a a weak form of sarcasm, asked if everyone wanted to go to the roof.



On the fourth-story roof Paul said he wanted to run âreally fast in a circle,â vaguely aware and mostly unconcerned, though he knew he didnât want to dieâless because he had an urge to live than because dying, like knitting or backgammon, seemed irrelevant to his lifeâthat due to alcohol and Klonopin, in a moment of inattention, he could easily walk off the building. He collided with an unseen Franâwho seemed already confused, before this, standing alone in an arbitrary area of the roofâand felt intrigued by the binary manner that his movement was stopped, though how else, he vaguely realized, could something stop? He texted Laura, inviting her to âcome eat Mexican food at a party,â then went downstairs and indiscriminately moved refried beans, guacamole, three kinds of chips, cucumber, salsa, beef onto his plate until he had a roughly symmetrical mound of food, on top of whichâon the way out of the kitchen, as a kind of afterthoughtâhe added a fluffy, triangular wedge of cake. After carrying the Mayan-pyramid-shaped plate of food, with some difficulty, up the ladder, onto the roof, where he silently ate it all, he belligerently directed conversation toward Laura-related things, then said he felt cold and was going inside. He descended the ladder until his head was below the opening to the roof and tried to hear what Fran and Danielâwho remained outside smokingâwere saying, while unaware of his presence, but couldnât, and also didnât know what could possibly be said that he would want to secretly hear, so returned inside the apartment and lay on his back on the sofa in the common room.

He woke to flash photography, then to Lindsayâs voice, in another room, loudly saying âget out.â Lindsay entered the common room and said, to a blearily waking Paul, something about âyour friendâ looking inside her purse, trying to steal her shoes. Paul stared blankly, a little embarrassed to have slept on his back, for an unknown amount of time, on the apartmentâs only sofa. He looked at his phone: no new texts. After saying âsorryâ a few times to Lindsay, who seemed unsure if she felt negatively toward Paul, he put a half-eaten onion, beer bottles, other trash into his Whole Foods bag and descended stairs behind Daniel and Fran, who was quietly murmuring things vaguely in her defense. They decided to go to Legion, a bar, one and a half blocks away, with an outdoor area on the sidewalk.

âWere you trying to steal her shoes?â said Daniel.

âNo, I wasnât,â said Fran quietly. âOur shoes look the same.â

âIâm asking because youâve told me you like to steal things when youâre drunk.â

âI wasnât stealing her shoes,â said Fran in a loud whisper.



They were walking toward Paulâs room, after ten minutes in Legion, when it became known, in a manner that seemed sourceless, as if they realized simultaneously, that Fran had âaccidentally,â she then said, stolen a leather jacket, which she was wearing. They agreed it would be inconvenient for the owner to not have their phone, which was in the jacket, but continued walking and each tried on the jacket, which seemed to best fit Paul, who found two gigantic vitamins in one of its pockets. In his room he put the phone on the table beside his mattress and, saying he didnât want to be near it, sort of pushed it away. He opened his MacBook and played âAnnoying Noise of Deathâ and saw that Daniel was calmly observing himself, in the full-length wall mirror, as he exercised with Carolineâs five-pound weights that were usually on the floor in the kitchen. Fran said to put on Rilo Kiley. Paul said it was Rilo Kiley and, after a few motionless seconds, Fran slowly turned her head away to rotate her face, like a moon orbiting behind its planet, interestingly out of view. Paul grinned to himself as he lay on his back and propped up his head with a folded pillow, resting his MacBook against the front of his thighs, both knees bent. Daniel sat on the mattress in a position that a robot in a black comedy about a child with two fathers, one of whom was a robot, would assume to recite a bedtime story, looking at Paul however with a slightly, stoically puzzled expression. âWhen you asked me if I liked Rilo Kiley, the night we met, I thought you were joking,â said Daniel.

âNo,â said Paul. âWhy did you think that?â

âYouâre more earnest than I thought youâd be.â

âI wouldnât joke about something like that.â

âLike what?â said Daniel.

Paul said he wouldnât pretend he liked something, or make fun of liking something, or like something âironically.â Daniel sort of drifted away and began looking at Paulâs books with a patient, scholarly demeanorâin continuation, Paul realized, of a calm inquisitiveness that had characterized most of his behavior tonight, probably due to the five Klonopin heâd ingested, though he was always inquisitive and would continue asking questions, in certain conversations, when others wouldâve stopped, which Paul liked. Twenty minutes later Daniel was reading pages of different books and Paul was looking at methadoneâs Wikipedia page (â. . . developed in Germany in 1937 . . . an acyclic analog of morphine or heroin . . .â) when Fran returned from outside with cuts on her face and neck from a group of girls, she said, that called her a bitch and said she tried to steal shoes and attacked her, pushing her down. Daniel asked how the girls opened the gate to the houseâs walkway. Fran repeated, with a vaguely confused expression, that she was attacked. Paul, who hadnât realized she had left the room, asked how she reentered the gate without a key. Fran stared expectantly at Daniel with her child-like gaze, then quietly engaged herself in a solitary activity elsewhere in the room as Daniel and Paul began pondering the situation themselves, to no satisfying conclusion. Fran said she wanted to go dancing at Legion before it closed in less than an hour and Paul thought he saw her put a number of pills into her mouth in the stereotypically indiscriminate manner heâd previously seen only on TV or in movies. Fran and Daniel did yoga-like stretches on Paulâs yoga mat and snorted two Adderallâcrushed into a potion-y blue, faintly neon sandâoff a pink piece of construction paper. Daniel briefly hugged a supine Paul, then stood at a distance as Fran lay flat on top of Paul with her head facedown to the right of his head. Fran didnât move for around forty seconds, during which, at one point, she murmured something that seemed significant but, muffled by the mattress, was not comprehensible. She rolled onto her back and Daniel pulled her to a standing position. Paul was surprised to feel moved in a calming, tearful mannerâas if some long-term desire, requiring a tiring amount of effort, had been fulfilledâwhen, before leaving for Legion, both Daniel and Fran affected slightly friendlier demeanors (rounder eyes, higher-pitched voices, a sort of pleasantness of expression like minor face-lifts) to confirm meeting at the book party Paul mentioned earlier and had forgotten.

Paul realized after they left that heâd gotten what from elementary school through college he often most wantedâunambiguous indications of secure, mutual friendshipsâbut was no longer important to him.



The book party, like algae, feeling its way elsewhere, moved slowly but persistently from the bookstoreâs basement to its first floor, to the sidewalk outside, converging finally with other groups at a corner bar, where Paul failed more than five times to recognize or remember the faces or names of recent to long-term acquaintancesâand twice introduced people heâd already introduced to each other, including Daniel and Frederick, both of whom however either feigned having not met or had actually forgottenâbut due to 2mg Klonopin remained poised, with a peaceful sensation of faultlessness, physiologically calm but mentally stimulated, throughout the night, as if beta testing the event by acting like an exaggerated version of himself, for others to practice against, before the real Paul, the only person without practice, was inserted for the actual event. Fran left for her apartment, which she shared with a low-level cocaine dealer majoring in something art related at Columbia, to prepare a kind of pasta, âwith a lot of things in it,â that was her specialty, it seemed. Paul and Daniel arrived ninety minutes later and Fran served a giant platter of cheese-covered, lasagna-like pastaâattractively browned in a mottled pattern of variations of crispinessâin small, colorful plastic bowls with buttered toast on which were thin slices of raw garlic. They ate all of it, then arranged themselves on Franâs three-seat sofa and watched Drugstore Cowboy on Danielâs MacBook. Paul was unable to discern the movie as coherentâhe kept thinking the same scene, in a motel room, was replaying with minor variationsâbut was aware of sometimes commenting on the sound track, including that it was âreally weirdâ and âunexpected.â

Before becoming unconscious Paul was aware of a man wearing a cowboy hat being carried out of a drugstore by four people and of himself thinking that, if the people dragging the man were invisible, the man would look like he was gliding feetfirst on a horizontal waterslide, steadily ahead, with out-of-control limbs and a crazed, antagonistic expression, as if by experimentally self-directed telekinesis.

A week later Paul had organized plans to see Trash Humpers and was waiting for Fran and Daniel at the theater. He had first asked Laura, who seemed to be in a relationship with her ex-boyfriendâpictures had appeared on Facebook in which they looked happily reunited in what seemed to be a faux-expensive hotelâto see the movie and sheâd said she wanted to but not tonight. Fran gave Paul six 10mg Adderall for her and Danielâs tickets and a disoriented-seeming Daniel, who had no money left, asked if Paul had any snacks. Paul gave Daniel a sugar-free Red Bull he got from a Red Bullâshaped car parked outside the library and Daniel drank it in one motion with a neutral expression.

âFran said sheâll pay you back if you give me one of the Adderall she gave you,â whispered Daniel a few minutes into the movie. âI donât think I can stay awake without it.â In the movie costumed actors made noises in parking lots and inside houses while destroying and/or âhumpingâ inanimate objects. Paul woke, at one point, to Fran laughing loudly when no one else in the small, sold-out theater was laughing. When Paul wasnât asleep he felt distracted by a feeling that Daniel had eerily turned his head 90 degrees and was staring at him, but each time he looked Daniel was either asleep or looking at the screen. The last ten minutes of the movie Paul was peripherally aware of Danielâs unsupported head continually lolling in place and twitching to attention in a manner reminiscent of a middle/high school student struggling and repeatedly failing to remain awake in a morning class. Daniel seemed fully alert seconds after the movie ended. Paul asked how he slept despite Adderall and Red Bull.

âSusie-Q,â said Daniel with a smirk-like grin indicating both earnest disapproval and a kind of fondness toward Seroquel and its intense, often uncomfortable tranquilizing effectsâas if, believing Susie-Q wasnât malicious, he could forgive her every time she induced twelve hours of sleep followed by twelve to twenty-four hours of feeling lost and irritable, therefore she functioned, if inadvertently, as a teacher of forgiveness and acceptance and empathy, for which he was grateful.



They were the last three people, after the movie, to leave the theater. They stood on the sidewalk, unsure what to do next. Fran had planned to go to Coney Island tonight and stay until morning for her birthday, which was todayâsheâd created a Facebook listing, which Paul remembered seeingâbut none of her friends wanted to go, because she didnât have any, she said. Paul said he also had no friends and that they should celebrate by âeating a lot of food.â

At Lovinâ Cup, a bar-restaurant with live music, Fran and Daniel ordered drinks, went outside to smoke. Paul laid the side of his head on his arms, on the table, and closed his eyes. He didnât feel connected by a traceable series of linked events to a source that had purposefully conveyed him, from elsewhere, into this world. He felt like a digression that had forgotten from what it digressed and was continuing ahead in a confused, choiceless searching. Fran and Daniel returned and ordered enchiladas, nachos. Paul ordered tequila, a salad, waffles with ice cream on top.

When the food arrived Paul ordered tater tots and more tequila. They ate silently in the loud bar. Paul felt he would need to scream, or exert an effort that would feel like he was screaming, to be heard. He was aware of Fran, to his left, quietly eating with her mouth near her plate, as if to hide something, or probably to reduce the distance to her enchiladas, which in Paulâs peripheral vision appeared shapeless, almost invisible. After Fran left to âdo homework,â she said, Paul and Daniel decided to try watching Drugstore Cowboy again, in Paulâs room.

On the walk to Danielâs apartment, to get Drugstore Cowboy, dozens of elderly, similarly dressed Asian men were standing in a loosely organized row, like a string of Christmas lights, seeming bored but alert, on a wide sidewalk, across from Bar Matchless. Daniel asked one of them what movie they were in and the Asian man seemed confused, then said âMartin Scorseseâ without an accent when Daniel asked again.

Around forty minutes later Paul said âthat looks like the group of Asians . . . we saw earlier,â realizing with amazement as he saw Bar Matchless that they had unwittingly walked to the same place.



Danielâs two suitemates were seated at a round, thin, foldable table on chairs Paul immediately viewed as âfound on the street,â talking to each other, it seemed, after returning from a concert. Except for a broom and what Daniel confirmedâgrimly, Paul feltâwas a giant plastic eggplant of unknown origin, there was nothing else in the common room.

Danielâs room had a dresser, mattress pad, wood chair, tiny desk. Within armâs reach, outside his window, was a brick wall covered with gradients of gray ash. Daniel showed Paul, who felt self-conscious and crowded, standing in place, a candle shaped like a lightbulb and said it was from his sister. Paul stared at it, unable to comprehend, in a way that made the behavior seem unreal, exactly why Daniel was showing it to him, with a feeling that heâd misheard, or not heard, something Daniel said a few seconds or minutes ago.



Paul woke sitting on his mattress with his back against a wall, beside Daniel, who seemed asleep and was also sitting. The room was palely lit by a cloudy, faintly pink morning. Paulâs MacBook, in front of them, showed Drugstore Cowboyâs menu screen. Paul shifted a littleâhis right leg was numbâand Daniel began talking in a clear voice, as if heâd been awake a few minutes already. Daniel wanted to ingest Adder-all instead of sleep. Paul, who couldnât remember if theyâd watched the movie, distractedly asked what they would do âall day.â

âWhat we normally do. Walk around. Fix my computer.â

âI feel . . . sleepy,â said Paul.

Daniel said something about Adderall.

âI feel like Iâll still be sleepy,â said Paul.

âYouâll be awake, trust me.â

âIâm not sure if I want to.â

âI feel like youâre eight years old or my girlfriend,â said Daniel around five minutes later.

âI really donât know what I want to do,â said Paul grinning.



An hour later, after each showering at his own apartment, they met and ingested Adderall and walked to Verb, a cafÃ© without internet, where they drank iced coffee and ingested a little more Adderall, then went in an adjacent bookstore, where Daniel showed Paul a translated book of nonfiction with a similar coverâoff-center black dot, white backgroundâas Shawn Oliveâs poetry book.

âThatâs funny,â said Paul grinning, and they got on the L train, then walked to the Apple store on Prince Street. Danielâs MacBook, which had files he needed for his job as a research assistant to an elderly ghostwriter (of sports autobiographies) who owed him $200, would require two weeks to be fixed. Daniel asked if Paul would go with him to Rhode Island, in three hours, to stay with Franâs family for a weekend. Paul declined, saying he hadnât been invited. Daniel said he confirmed last week but didnât want to go anymore and that, a few minutes ago, Fran texted she couldnât, against expectation, get any Oxycodoneâwithout which it was going to be âunbearable,â Daniel felt, for both himself and Fran, to be around Franâs family. Paul declined again, saying it seemed stressful. It began raining from a partly sunny sky, and they went in an Urban Outfitters. Daniel walked to a table of books and stood without looking at anything, like a tired child waiting for an overbearingly upbeat mother to finish shopping.

âYou seem worried,â said Paul.

âSorry. Iâm trying to think of an excuse to tell Fran.â



It was sunny and cloudless, around twenty minutes later, when they sat side by side on a bench in Washington Square Park. Daniel swallowed something and mutely handed Paul a 20mg Adderall, which Paul swallowed. Two preadolescent girls ran around the fountain area repeatedly. Paul said he felt like he hadnât run as fast as possible in probably five or ten years. When the Adderall took effect Daniel began to praise Paulâs writing without restraint or pause for twenty to thirty minutes and asked about Paulâs IQ. Paul said it was either 139 or 154. Daniel was quiet a few seconds, then with a slightly troubled expression said his IQ was higher, seeming like he felt more complicatedly doomed, as a person, with this information. Paul said his mother always said that his and his brotherâs IQs were exactly the same, but sometimes also said she was required, as a parent, to say that.

Daniel said his sister had multiple doctorates, his parents and aunts and uncles were all high-level professors, but he was ânot anything.â Paul knew from previous conversations that Daniel, as a teenager, had been on months-long retreats to Buddhist monasteries, culminating in something like a year alone, when he turned 18, in India or Tibet. Daniel walked away to call Fran and Paul read a text from Laura asking if he wanted to see Trash Humpers tonight. Paul texted he already saw it, and they made plans to record a song in his room in two hours. Daniel returned and said he told Fran his computer had to be fixed today, or not for two weeks, and he needed it to do work, because he hadnât paid last monthâs rent, so wasnât going to Rhode Island, and that âshe got really angry.â

âI feel like you did the right thing . . . I mean . . . outside of being honest,â said Paul grinning. âYour relationship with her is more accurate now.â

âYour use of the word âaccurateâ is interesting.â

âShe has a more accurate view of your view of her now probably,â said Paul.



Laura arrived with Walter, whom Paul hadnât expected, two hours late and reacted to Paulâs agitation, as they walked from the bronze gate to the house, with resentment and dismissiveness, then became a little apologetic in Paulâs room, showing him texts sheâd sent to Walter telling him to hurry.

âYou canât blame me,â said Walter, and chuckled. âI donât even know why Iâm here. You suddenly just started texting me to drive you here.â

âNow everyone is turning against me,â said Laura smiling nervously, not looking at anyone. Paul asked Walter if it was true, as heâd thought heâd read on Gawker, that Detroit, where Walter was from, only had seven grocery stores. Walter laughed quietly and said that wasnât true and that Detroit was comparable, he felt, to Ann Arbor maybe. Paul said he was going to Ann Arbor in September, for his book tour, and asked what size it was, and was peripherally aware of Laura turning away, like sheâd observed the interaction and concluded something, as she said ânow youâre going to ask Walter a lot of questions.â

âItâs like Berkeley,â said Walter.

âItâs that big?â said Paul in a dreamy voice, and moved, vaguely for privacy, from the mattress to the floor, where he texted Daniel and ingested a Klonopin, weakly thinking âit wonât begin working until I wonât need it as much anymore.â Walter and Laura, who had brought a tambourine and a shaker, talked idly, a few feet from Paul, who thought Walterâs grumpiness after leaving Kyle and Gabbyâs party, when heâd wielded a Red Bull Soda, now seemed endearing. Paul noticed Laura looking at his pile of construction paper and said she could have some if she wanted, and she focused self-consciously on wanting some, saying how she would use it and what colors she liked, seeming appreciative in an affectedly sincere mannerâthe genuine sincerity of a person who doesnât trust her natural behavior to appear sincere. Paul went outside and opened the bronze gate and laughed a little when Daniel said he should âgrow an enormous afro without any warningâ for his next author photo and they sat on the front stoop. The late-afternoon sky, in Paulâs peripheral vision, panoramic and mostly unobstructed, appeared rural or suburban, more indicative of forests and fields and lakesâof natureâs vast connections, through the air and the soil, to more of itselfâthan of outer space, which was mostly what Paul thought of when beneath an urban sky, even in daytime, especially in Manhattan, between certain buildings, framing sunless zones of upper atmosphere, as if inviting space down to deoxygenate a city block. Walter exited the house and mentioned a party in Chelsea and left. Laura exited a few minutes later, meekly holding her tambourine and shaker and some construction paper. âI see you âgot in onâ the construction paper,â said Paul in the sarcastic, playful voice heâd used to recommend Funyuns the night they met, but with a serious expression. âGood choices, in terms of colors. Good job.â

âYou said I could have some,â said Laura hesitantly.

âI know,â said Paul. âIâm glad you got some.â

âWell, Iâm going home now,â said Laura with a shy expression, not looking at anyone.



At a party that night Paul met Taryn, a friend of Caroline and Shawn Oliveâs, and became graduallyâalmost unnoticeablyâintrigued by their interactions. They rarely talked and never touched but remained, for some reason, near each other, as if one was the otherâs manager or personal assistant, but neither knew their role and could only study the other for clues, which they seemed to do, gazing at each other anthropomorphically, for seconds at a time, surprisingly without awkwardness, then she seemed to disappear and was quickly forgotten. Paul sat with strangers on a crowded staircase and drank a beer while looking at his phone, sometimes staring at its screen for ten to twenty seconds without thinking anything, before maneuvering through a crowded hallway into a medium-size room. Around twenty-five people were dancing to loud music with faces that seemed expressive in an emotionless, hidden, bone-ward mannerâthe faces of people with the ability to stop clutching the objects of themselves and allow their brains, like independent universes with unique and inconstant natural laws, to react, like trees to wind, with their bodies to music.

Paul walked directly to a two-seat sofa (golden brown and deeply padded as the upturned paw of an enormous stuffed animal) and lay on it, on his side, facing the room, and closed his eyes. After a blip of surprise, which disintegrated in some chemical system of Klonopin and Valium and alcohol instead of articulating into what wouldâve startled Paul awakeâthat heâd fluently, with precision and total calm, entered a room of dozens of people and lain facing outward on a sofaâwas asleep. When he woke, an unknown amount of time laterâ between five and forty minutes, or longerâhe observed neutrally that, though he was drooling a little and probably the only non-dancing person in the room, no one was looking at him, then moved toward the roomâs iPod with the goal-oriented, zombie-like calmness of a person who has woken at night thirsty and is walking to his refrigerator and changed the music to âTodayâ by the Smashing Pumpkins. Every person, it seemed, stopped dancing and appeared earnestly annoyed butâas if to avoid encouraging the behaviorâdidnât look at Paul or say anything and, when the music was changed back, resumed dancing, like nothing had happened.



In early June, after four more parties, two at which he similarly slept on sofas after walking mutely through rooms without looking at anyone, Paul began attending fewer social gatherings and ingesting more drugs, mostly with Daniel and Fran, or only Daniel, or sometimes alone, which seemed classically ânot a good sign,â he sometimes thought, initially with mild amusement, then as a neutral observation, finally as a meaningless placeholder. Due to his staggered benzodiazepine usage and lack of obligations or long-term projects and that he sometimes ingested Seroquel and slept twelve to sixteen hours (always waking, it seemed, at night, uncomfortable and disoriented and unsure what to do, usually returning to sleep) he had gradually become unaware of day-to-day or week-to-week changes in his lifeâand, when he thought of himself in terms of months and years, he still viewed himself as in an âinterim period,â which by definition, he felt, would end when his book tour beganâso he viewed the trend, of fewer people and more drugs, as he might view a new waiter at Taco Chulo: âthere, at some point,â separate from him, not of his concern, beyond his ability or desire to track or control.

When he wanted to know what happened two days ago, or five hours ago, especially chronologically, he would sense an impasse, in the form of a toll, which hadnât been there before, payable by an amount of effort (not unlike that required in problem solving or essay writing) he increasingly felt unmotivated to exert. There were times when his memory, like an external hard drive that had been taken from him and hidden inside an unwieldy series of cardboard boxes, or placed at the end of a long and dark and messy corridor, required much more effort than he felt motivated to exert simply to locate, after which, he knew, more effort would be required to gain access. After two to five hours with no memory, some days, he would begin to view concrete reality as his memoryâa place to explore idly, without concern, but somewhat pointlessly, aware that his actual existence was elsewhere, that he was, in a way, hiding here, away from where things actually happened, then were stored here, in his memory.

Having repeatedly learned from literature, poetry, philosophy, popular culture, his own experiences, most movies heâd seen, especially ones he liked, that it was desirable to âlive in the present,â ânot dwell on the past,â etc., he mostly viewed these new obstacles to his memory as friendly and, sometimes, momentarily believing in their viability as a form of Zen, exciting or at least interesting. Whenever he wanted to access his memory (usually to analyze or calmly replay a troubling or pleasant social interaction) and sensed the impasse, which he almost always did, to some degree, or that his memory was currently missing, as was increasingly the case, he would allow himself to stop wanting, with an ease, not unlike dropping a leaf or stick while outdoors, he hadnât felt beforeâand, partly because heâd quickly forget what heâd wanted, without a sensation of loss or worry, only an acknowledgment of a different distribution of consciousness than if heâd focused on assembling and sustaining a memoryâand passively continue with his ongoing sensory perception of concrete reality.



In mid-June, one dark and rainy afternoon, Paul woke and rolled onto his side and opened his MacBook sideways. At some point, maybe twenty minutes after heâd begun refreshing Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Gmail in a continuous cycleâwith an ongoing, affectless, humorless realization that his day âwas overââhe noticed with confusion, having thought it was a.m., that it was 4:46 p.m. He slept until 8:30 p.m. and âworked on thingsâ in the library until midnight and was two blocks from his room, carrying a mango and two cucumbers and a banana in a plastic bag, when Daniel texted âcome hang out, Mitch bought a lot of coke.â

Daniel and Mitch were outside a bar, discussing where to use the cocaine. Paul said Daniel looked âreally tiredâ and asked if he needed some eggplant, in reference to a joke they had that Daniel was heavily dependent on eggplant and almost always suffering its withdrawal symptoms, which could be horrific. Daniel said he stayed up last night with Fran, currently sleeping, to celebrate, by eating brunch and buying drugs, that sheâd quit her job she got three days ago waitressing in a Polish restaurant.

They crossed the street to Mitchâs friend Harryâs apartment, where Harry, whom Mitch had earlier given some cocaine for his birthday, was repeatedly trying to hug more than one person at a time while shouting what one would normally speak. Paul walked aimlessly, into a kitchen, where he stood in darkness at the sink peeling and eating his mango. He washed his hands and walked through the apartmentâs main roomâtwo desktop computers and speakers on a corner table, four large windows overlooking Graham Avenue, ten to fifteen people hugging and shouting, two mediumsize dogsâinto an institutionally bright hallway, where he heard Daniel in a bathroom whose door wasnât fully closed. âItâs me,â said Paul, and pushed the door, against resistance, which relented when he said âitâs Paul,â revealing a vaguely familiar girl, who appeared extremely tired, sitting on a bathtubâs outer edge, looking at Daniel and Mitch huddled on the floor around a toilet-seat lid with cocaine on it.

âYouâre doing it without me,â said Paul in an exaggerated monotone.

âWe thought you left,â said Daniel.

âI wouldnât just leave,â said Paul.

âOut of anyone I know youâre probably most likely to just leave,â said Daniel crushing cocaine with his debit card.

Paul looked at the girl, who shrugged.

Mitch, who was allergic to Harryâs dogs, sneezed.

âJesus, be careful,â said Daniel quietly.

âHeâs sharing it with us,â said Paul. âAnd all you can do is berate him.â

âBro,â said Daniel, and seemed to grin at Paul a little.



At Legion, twenty minutes later, Paul was sitting alone on a padded seat, staring at an area of torsos that were beginning to seem face-like. He texted Daniel that he was going to Khimâs to âstock up on eggplantâ and walked six blocks to the large deli below Harryâs apartment, feeling energetic and calm, listening to Rilo Kiley through earphones at a medium volume. He paid for an organic beef patty, two kombuchas, five bananas, alfalfa sprouts, arugula, hempseed oil, a red onion, ginger, toilet paper and carried two paper bags reinforced with plastic bags toward Legion. Harry approached on the sidewalk with a panic-like expression of uncommitted confusion and, staring ahead, passed with a sweating forehead like the person in Go who is abandoned by a friend in an alleyway outside a rave whileâdue to too much ecstasyâfoaming at the mouth.

Mitch and Daniel, in the soundless distance, were outside Legion. As Paul approached, crossing a street, Daniel entered Legion. Mitch said they were openly snorting cocaine off a table in the back room, because the bathroom line was too long, when a security guard approached and Mitch threw the bag of cocaine (which Daniel was currently trying to find) under a table, or somewhere. They crossed the street, went in White Castle, sat in a booth. Paul realized a poster said âchicken ringsâ not âonion ringsâ and said it seemed âinsaneâ and speculated on the process that must be required of making the meat into a paste to mold into rings.

âIâm worried about Daniel,â said Mitch.

âHe has a warrant for his arrest in Colorado, I think,â said Paul.

âJesus,â said Mitch.

âItâs probably better if he goes to jail instead of you. Heâs unemployed and in debt to like five people. He has a seventy-dollar tab with me. I think he needs six hundred dollars in one week for overdue rent. You have a real job and a nice apartment. If he goes to jail Iâll relinquish his tab.â

Mitch was fidgeting a little.

âWe can make a blog about him and mail him letters,â said Paul.

âA blog,â said Mitch. âJesus.â

âIâm going to look for him,â said Paul.



In Legionâs bathroom Paul read a text from Daniel that said âcome outside.â Daniel, on the sidewalk, seeing Paul, began crossing the street, toward White Castle, looking in different directions while saying he knew the bouncers at Legion and that Mitch shouldnât have panicked. Paul said Mitch had a high-paying job.

âWhere is he?â

âWhite Castle,â said Paul.

âShould I get some of this coke? I couldâve gotten in trouble.â

âYeah. If thatâs what you want.â

âHeâs lucky it landed on this little ledge,â said Daniel staring ahead as White Castle passed on their left. âI donât think any was lost.â

âMy groceries are in White Castle. Where are you going?â

âLetâs go to your room to do some of this coke,â said Daniel.

âItâs too far,â said Paul slowing his pace.

âWeâll go there and come back, it wonât take long.â

âItâs way too far,â said Paul. âJust snort it off your hand.â

They were on a dark street with no people, moving cars, or stores. Danielâs head seemed more elevated than normalâand his neck, swiveling and ostrich-like, more mechanical and controlledâas he looked in different directions while removing cocaine from the bag with what seemed to be his fingers, then somehow maneuvering his hand into a fist, which he put into his jeans pocket. Paul felt unsettled, imagining amounts of cocaine trickling between fingers and slipping off the sides of fingers and the curve of the palm and sticking as powder against Danielâs hand and pocket interior. Paul ripped a page from his Moleskine journal and said âhere, use this.â Daniel continued looking in different directions a few seconds before taking the page and putting it directly in his pants pocket.

âYou should snort it off the Lincoln,â said Paul.

âThere isnât a Lincoln here,â said Daniel.

âThat looks like a Lincoln,â said Paul pointing.

âThatâs a Pontiac,â said Daniel looking elsewhere.

âYou should hide between two cars,â said Paul, and Daniel moved slowly toward the street. Paul used his phone to photograph Daniel kneeling between two cars and sent the photo to his own Gmail account and to Danielâs phone. He imagined them both sprinting in different directions the instant a spotlight appeared, gliding across the street, toward them, from a low-flying helicopter.

âGood job,â said Paul walking toward White Castle.

âYou know I donât usually do this to friends,â said Daniel staring ahead.

âWhat do you mean?â said Paul grinning.

âI mean, do you think itâs okay I did that?â

âYeah. You were put in a dangerous situation.â

âI was looking on the ground for it, but it was on this little shelf,â said Daniel in White Castle.

âJesus,â said Mitch, who seemed distracted in a respiratory manner like, after Paul left, heâd become increasingly worried and hyperventilated a little and was still recovering. Daniel handed Mitch the bag and said âum, it was open, so I donât know how much fell out,â with, it seemed, slightly averted eyes. Mitch put the bag in his pocket without responding and, with unfocused eyes, said he was going to the bathroom and went.



After snorting cocaine in Paulâs room Daniel and Mitch moved into the kitchen, then into Carolineâs room. Carolineâs door, except when she was sleeping, was always partly open. Paul, whose door was almost always closed, listened from his mattress and when he heard someone say âchicken ringsâ stood without thinking and went to Carolineâs room. Daniel and Mitch were aggressively looking at Carolineâs shelves and walls, bending at their waists and craning their necks.

âHi, Paul,â said Caroline.

âHi. I heard someone say âchicken rings.â â

âChicken rings?â said Caroline.

âI think I misheard,â said Paul. âNever mind.â

âCaroline was telling us she went to a Fuck Buttons concert tonight,â said Mitch.

âSomeone was talking about them before,â said Paul vaguely. âI feel like . . . Daniel . . . you were telling me about them. Fuck Buttons.â

âI donât think so,â said Daniel.

âLast night, maybe,â said Paul.

âWhere were we last night?â

âUm,â said Paul looking down with unfocused eyes, aware he looked like he was thinking but wasnât, an increasingly common deception for him. âI donât know,â he said after a few seconds, then said âShawn Oliveâ as a non sequitur and grinned and said âDaniel knows Shawn Oliveâ to Caroline, who had gone to school with Shawn Olive.

âWhoâs Shawn Olive?â said Mitch.

âI donât know,â said Paul immediately while laughing a little. âI mean . . . seems hard to just answer that.â

âWeâre good friends,â said Caroline. âHeâs great.â

âWe saw Robin Hood last night,â said Daniel.



Paul was alone, a few hours later, stomach-down on his bed, working on things on his MacBookâon 20mg Adderallâafter eating most of his organic beef patty with an arugula salad containing flax seeds, alfalfa sprouts, cucumber, tamari, lemon juice, flax oil. He and Daniel, whoâd left around 3:30 a.m. with Mitch, had been emailing steadily and were committed to meet at 9:30 a.m. to go to the Museum of Modern Art, where Marina AbramoviÄ was performing The Artist Is Present, for which she would be sitting in a chair for 736 hours over 77 days, staring at whoever was next in line to sit and stare back at her from an opposite chair. When Paul emailed Daniel at 9:22 a.m. that he was naked and hadnât showered Daniel responded that he was also naked and also hadnât showered. At 9:54 a.m. Paul texted âwhere the fuck are you.â Daniel responded immediately that he was still naked and hadnât moved from his bed.

They met, an hour later, at an intersection near the Graham L train stop. One of them said the museum would be crowded on a Sunday and, within seconds, both had strongly committed to not going. They went to the bookstore adjacent Verb. âShawn Olive,â said Daniel holding the book with a black dot on its cover toward Paul and grinning. âShawn Oliveâs book has the same cover. Almost the same cover.â

âWe already showed each other that,â said Paul.

âWhat do you mean?â

âWe showed each other this book. Are you joking?â

âNo,â said Daniel. âWe talked about this book?â

âWe talked about it where weâre standing right now.â

âDamn,â said Daniel looking away. âI donât remember.â



At Verb they each ingested 10mg Adderall. Daniel removed from his tote bag a glass jar with a peanut butter label and, with a neutral expression, not looking at Paul, poured around 4oz of whiskey into his iced coffee. Paul asked what Daniel was going to do about his financial situation. Daniel said Mitch, a week ago, had mentioned hiring him to write promotional copy for his band but hadnât mentioned it again. Paul suggested they shoplift things from Best Buy, or some other store, to sell on eBay.

Outside, walking steadily but aimlessly, they entered East River State Park and sat on grass, facing the river and Manhattan, which seemed to Paul like an enormous, unfinished cruise ship that had been disassembled and rearranged by thousands of disconnected organizations. They decided to sell books on the sidewalk, on Bedford Avenue, but continued sitting. Daniel began talking, a few minutes later, in a quiet, earnest voice about his lack of accomplishments in life, staring into the distance with a haunted, slightly puzzled expression, seeming at times like he might begin crying. Paul, grinning anxiously at Danielâs right profile, unsure what to say, or do, shrugged more than once, thinking that tears would have a restorative effect on the seared dryness of Danielâs eyes, which looked like theyâd been baked at a low heat.

âWhat were we doing now?â said Paul leaving the park, around twenty minutes later.

Daniel looked distractedly in both directions after walking a few steps onto a street, then turned right on the sidewalk, staring ahead with a worried expression.

âWe had a specific goal, I remember,â said Paul. âWhat was it?â

âI donât know,â said Daniel after a few seconds.

âWe were just talking about it.â

âI remember something,â said Daniel absently.

âOh yeah, selling books,â said Paul.

âLetâs do that,â said Daniel.

âWe just actually forgot our purpose, then regained it,â said Paul grinning. âWe still kept moving at the same speed, when we had no goal.â

âJesus,â said Daniel quietly.



On the way to Paulâs room, to get books to sell, they went in a pizza restaurant, because Daniel was hungry. Paul, rereading old texts, saw one he didnât recognizeââsorry, how was the partyââfrom Laura, more than a month ago, the morning after the Cinco de Mayo party. Between then and now, maybe two weeks ago, Paul had asked her in an email if she remembered referring to him as âmy boyfriend,â the night they attended two parties on Ambien. Sheâd said no, but was sorry if she did, but was sure she didnât, then later emailed to say her friends whoâd been there confirmed she didnât. Paul was staring through glass at a pigeon eating specks off the sidewalk when he noticed the approach of what he briefly, with some sarcasm, began to perceive as another pigeon, inside the restaurant, but was Daniel. âUm, so, my debit card, either from cutting so much blow or being maxed out, isnât working,â he said in a quiet, controlled voice with an earnest expression. âCould I borrow $2.75 for a slice of pizza?â

âYeah,â said Paul thinking he wasnât going to mention the pigeon illusion. âIâll add it to your tab.â



Daniel stood near the center of Paulâs room quietly saying that he felt âfuckedâ about his financial situation and generally, in terms of his life, then kneeled to a low table to organize two lines of cocaine with the last of what he had from Mitchâs bag. Paul, stomach-down on his mattress, asked what music he should play and clicked âHeartbeatsâ by the Knife. They both laughed a little and Paul clicked âLast Niteâ by the Strokes and said it sounded too depressing. He clicked âSuch Great Heightsâ by The Postal Service and said âjust kidding.â He clicked âThe Peter Criss Jazzâ by Don Caballero. He clicked âpause.â

Daniel said to put The Postal Service back on and snorted half his line. Paul moved a rolled-up page of Shawn Oliveâs poetry book in his right nostril toward the cocaine and exhaled a little after snorting half his line, causing the rest and some of Danielâs to spread in a poof on the table. Daniel lightly berated Paul, who sort of rolled toward his mattressâs center, thenâliking the feeling of unimpeded motion on a padded surfaceâmoved his MacBook to the floor and lay in a diagonal on his back with his limbs spread out a little, which felt interesting because, he knew, it was probably the second or third time heâd lain on this mattress, while awake and alert and not impatient toward himself, without reading a book, looking at his MacBook, or aware of his MacBookâs screen.

At a certain age, he remembered, he had often lain motionless on carpet, or a sofa, feeling what he probably viewed, at the time, as boredom and what now seemed like ignorance ofâor passive disbelief inâhis forthcoming death, which would occur regardless of his thoughts, feelings, or actions in the unknown amount of remaining interim, upon a binary absorption from some incomprehensible direction, taking him elsewhere. Briefly, without much interest, Paul intuited that if he were immortal, or believed he was, he might feel what heâd felt as a child, which seemed less enjoyable than obscurely unsatisfying, something heâd want to be distracted from feeling. After a few minutes an out-of-view Daniel continued to say he felt depressed, but in a calmer voice that Paul felt was âsoothing,â for him, to hear, from his bed.



They sat facing south at Bedford and North 1st with thirty to forty books on a rollout carpet and, in a few hours, sold around $25 of books and $60 of Paulâs Adderall, which he received monthly by mail at slightly-better-than-drug-dealer price from a graduate student at Boston College. Four fashionable black teenagers appeared and, Paul thought, âthe leader,â who was much more interested than the others, asked if he could âsampleâ Charlesâ book.

âIâll take it,â he said after laughing loudly at something in the book, which included poetry and prose about alienation, boredom, science fiction, depression, confusion.

Daniel asked if the teenager liked Adderall.

âWhat is it?â

Daniel described it in a few sentences.

âSo, itâs like ecstasy?â

âSort of,â said Daniel. âBut without the euphoria. Itâs good for doing work. It helps you focus.â

The teenager asked if his friend was âin.â

âNo,â said his friend. âBut Iâll watch you do it.â

âDo you want your book signed? The author is here,â said Paul pointing at Daniel, who had been pretending he was Charles, with Charlesâ approval gained by text.

Daniel wrote âbest wishes, from Charlesâ in the book.

Charlesâ six weeks in Mexico and Guatemala, related in emails and Gmail chats, traveling hostel to hostel, spending much of his time in internet cafÃ©s feeling alienated from Americans doing what he was doing, but in groups, had taken on the tone and focus, after two weeks, of a comedic sitcom, which heâd named Avoiding Jehan, because his primary concern, most days, was to avoid or endure or try to permanently escape a person named Jehan, who had repeatedlyâalmost always inadvertently, obliviouslyâthwarted Charlesâ few romantic prospects and, in social situations, caused Charles to become âthe third wheelâ or âthe fifth wheel.â In one email Charles had wished Jehan would âbecome invisible.â After getting stalled in Guatemala, on the way to South America, two weeks ago, Charles had returned cashless to his girlfriend and Seattle, where they now shared âa smaller, shittier apartment,â he said, than when he left America, around two months ago.



The sky had begun to colorfully darken, a few hours later, with reds and purples and pinks that drifted away, like cotton candy, from an unseen horizon, as if something there was changing and releasing energy, when an Asian girl, who had slowed and passed a minute ago while talking into an iPhone, returned and said she recognized Paul from the internet and distractedly asked if Daniel was a cop.

âNo,â said Daniel, and the Asian girl said she was buying marijuana from someone with a business card, which she showed Daniel, at his request. She bought two books and three Adderall and kneeled and asked if Daniel or Paul had a driverâs license, to move her friendâs car from Crown Heights to the Graham L train station for money. They discussed the car for what seemed like fifteen minutes, without resolution, then the girl, whose name was Annie, which Paul heard initially as Addy, removed a Chinese magazine from her bag and asked if Paul was good at translating. Paul said he couldnât read Chinese or speak Mandarin fluently, and had an American accent sometimes, heâd been told. âIâm going to pee,â he said, and went to Verb, two blocks away. In line, behind two people, he thought that, from a certain point onwardâbeginning with his book tour, maybeâhe would only appear in public if heâd ingested sufficient drugs to not primarily be a source of anxiety, bleakness, awkwardness, etc. for himself and/or others.

When Paul returned to Daniel and Annie they were talking about Annieâs boyfriend, who had attended the same college as Daniel, in Colorado. Annieâs boyfriend had gone to India after college. When he returned to America, three years ago, he died for a reason that Paul, who was thinking of how spring was to summer like a morning was to an entire day, brief and lucid and transitional, didnât hear. Annie said her boyfriendâs funeral, due to a request heâd made in India, had been organized and promoted like a party and was âweird,â because it had been exactly like a party except everyone was wearing black.



â¢ â¢ â¢



In mid-July, a few weeks later, at a party that, instead of ending, had moved outside, through a window at the back of someoneâs bedroom, onto an eighth-floor roof, Paul and Daniel were on an additionally elevated platformâcorner-set, wall-less, square, smoothâlike a landing pad for tiny helicopters.

Daniel was standing with limbs and neck uncoordinatedly extended, slightly striding in placeâthe pre-predatory stance of a chained thing that had broken free and didnât yet know where to direct its vengeance, or what to do generally. His vision was focused horizontally, as if across a flat expanse. Then, with his back to one of the two edges dropping to the street, he approached an already fearful Paulâsitting cross-legged at the platformâs center, aware Daniel had been drinking steadily for hours and was probably on two or more drugsâwho reacted preemptively, against what seemed like a purposeless entity unreasonably desiring his involvement, with defensive movements of his arms and hands, causing the situation, in Paulâs panicked state, to immediately seem like an unrestrained wrestling, though it probably looked more like an exaggeratedly confused handshaking. Paul tried to concentrate on flattening himselfâon retaining a low, stable centerâwhile repeatedly telling Daniel to âstop,â because it was âdangerous,â he heard himself say in a gravely serious, faintly humorous voice of uncertainly suppressed fear, but was distracted by how most of his thoughts were based on a reality in which he had fallen off the building. Should he close his eyes? What should he try to see? What would his mother do/feel? Could he grab things to disrupt his fall like in movies? Could one of these be his final thought? What would that mean? Why couldnât he comprehend this? Should he think other things?

Eight people were in Erinâs five-seat car, which had gotten lost on its way from Paulâs book-release reading in Brooklyn to DuMont Burger, also in Brooklyn, when it was stopped by a police car, in Manhattan, around two hundred feet from the Williamsburg Bridge. The officer shined a flashlight through the driverâs window at the backseat without bending to see what was there, then asked Erin, 24, who had driven four hours that day from Baltimore to attend Paulâs reading and visit friends, to step outside the car. Paul, in the front passenger seat, hadnât seen Fran, who was sitting partly on him, or Daniel, in the backseat, in five or six weeks, except once, briefly and separately, at a Bret Easton Ellis reading three weeks ago, when theyâd avoided each other, and Fran, without context, had shown Paul a text from Daniel insulting her in a strangely formal, almost aristocratic tone. Paul had communicated regularly, the past month, only with Charles, by email or Gmail chat, mostly about what food they had eaten, or were thinking about eating, to âconsoleâ themselves. After being more social, April to July, than any other period of his life, Paul had returned to his default lifestyle, which varied, to some degree, but generally entailed (1) avoiding most social situations (2) not wanting to sleep most nights and not knowing whyâheâd wanted since 2006 to title one of his books I Donât Want to Sleep but I Donât Know What Iâm Waiting Forâresulting usually in four to ten hours of looking at the internet, reading, masturbating, etc. until morning, when he would eat something and sleep until night.

Erin, back in her car, said the officer had looked at her two-months-expired, out-of-state driverâs license an abnormally long time, like heâd forgotten what he was doing, before quietly saying âbe carefulâ and allowing her to continue driving, in what seemed to be an egregious oversight, without a ticket or decreasing passengers.



Paul first learned of Erin twenty months ago, in January 2009, when she commented on his blog and he clicked her profile and read her pensive, melancholy, amusing accounts, on her blog, of her vague relationships and part-time bookstore job and nights drinking beer while looking at the internet and classes at the University of Baltimore, where sheâd reenrolled after a two-year break. Paul found and readâand reread, with high levels of interestâthree long stories, each focused on an unrequited or failed relationship, that she had published in online magazines. Erin, being an attractive and adventurous-seeming person, was probably almost always, Paul imagined, entering or leavingâor, in some way, maneuveringâone or more relationships, but probably, between relationships, as a person who seemed to enjoy being alone sometimes, would become more active on the internet, for weeks or months, which over months and years would overlap with Paulâs nearly continuously high levels of internet activity. They would gradually communicate more and maybe begin emailing andâif neither died, entered long relationships, or left the internetâeventually meet in person. Paul viewed this process as self-fulfilling, not something he wanted to track or manipulate, so after one or two weeks had mostly internalized Erinâs existenceâas a busy person with a separate life, in a different cityâand had stopped thinking about her by mid-February, when he met Michelle, with whom he was in a relationship both times, before tonight, that he met Erin in person.

The first time was in July, when Erin visited New York City for the release of Charlesâ poetry book. The day after the release Paul was amused and excited for them, at a BBQ, when Charles said he had kissed Erin.

The second time was in September, one year ago, when Erin attended Paulâs reading in Baltimore. At a restaurant, with a large group of people, but talking only to each other, Paul asked about Charles, whom Erin had visited in August. Erin said she had changed her plane ticket and left earlier than planned because Charles had become gradually less affectionate, culminating with a night when, after sex, he said he didnât feel anything for her, then consoled her, as she cried, in his kitchen. Paul liked Erinâs forthright, unhesitant, nonjudgmental answers and that she was ableâalready, despite what seemed like strong disappointmentâto view and describe what had happened as at least partly amusing. When Erin asked about Michelle, as they walked to her car, Paul automatically said Michelle was âgoodâ while distinctly recalling a recent night when he complained he always offered her food or drink before himself, then after Michelle said sheâd be happy to do that, now that she knew it mattered to him, said it didnât matter to him and she shouldnât change. Exiting Erinâs car, at the hotel he was staying in for one night, because a mysterious Johns Hopkins professor, whose Face-book name was âCloud Bat,â had bought him a room, Paul thought that if he werenât in a relationship with Michelle he would ask Erin upstairs, where they would, he vaguely imagined, continue talking.



As Erinâs car slowly accelerated away from the police car, onto the Williamsburg Bridge, one person, then another, said they were illegally carrying drugs. After a peculiarly awkward, car-wide silence that became comical when someone asked if every person in the car was illegally carrying drugs, eliciting three affirmations and a sort of confirmatory announcement that every personâErin, Paul, Daniel, Fran, Mitch, Juan, Jeannie, Jeremyâwas illegally carrying drugs, there was the immediately space-filling noise of a small crowd laughing, which continued for around five seconds, during which Paul (who, in sharing his seat with Fran, was partly turned toward the driverâs window) watched the police car, or a police car, zoom past in the left lane, with emergency lights on and sirens off, quick and soundless as an apparition or the hologram of itself.

In DuMont Burgerâs bathroom Paul swallowed half of half a 30mg Oxycodone and .5mg Xanax, feebly amused to be already deviating, in moderate excess, from his plans to ingest specific amounts of drugs at certain times during his book tour, September 7 to November 4. To determine what amount of what drugsâMDMA, LSD, any benzodiazepine, amphetamine, opiateâhe should ingest, on what days, to minimize anxiety and boredom for himself and others, heâd edited the seven-page itinerary from his publisher to fit on one page and, in an idle process heâd enjoyed, the past few weeks, studied each event in context, writing notes on the paper. Heâd printed a final draft, currently in his pocket, that said he should ingest somethingâspecified, in most instances, by type and amountâbefore twenty-two of his twenty-five events and some miscellaneous things such as the day a writer from BlackBook was writing an article about âhanging outâ with him while doing that.

Paul splashed water on his face, which he dried, then returned to his seat, next to Juan, who was talking to Jeremy about whether a horse could win âbest athlete of the year.â Erin, the only person Paul felt like talking to, at the moment, was out of range, so when two acquaintances who didnât know anyone else arrived Paul sat with them at a four-person table, where he felt self-conscious about the tenuousness of his situationâhe hadnât ordered food because he was nauseated from the Oxycodone and long car ride and he didnât have anything he wanted to say to anyone. When a friend of the acquaintances arrived, sitting at the tableâs fourth seat, Paul fixated on herâmaybe partly to justify his increasingly pointless, idle presenceâin an exaggerated manner (asking her questions continuously while sustaining a âconcentrating expressionâ with such intensity, muddled by the onset of the drugs heâd used in the bathroom, that he sometimes felt able to sense the weight of the microscopic painting of the restaurantâs interior, decreased by a dimension and scaled down to almost nothing, resting on the top curvature of his right eyeball) that felt conducive to abruptly stopping and leaving, which he did, after around fifteen minutes of increasingly forced conversation, walking six blocks to his room.

After blearily looking at the internet a little, then peeing and brushing his teeth and washing his face, he lay in darkness on his mattress, finally allowing the simple insistence of the opioid, like an unending chord progression with a consistently unexpected and pleasing manner of postponing resolution, to accumulate and expand, until his brain and heart and the rest of him were contained within the same song-like beatingâof another, larger, protective heartâinside of which, temporarily safe from the outside world, he would shrink into the lunar city of himself and feel and remember strange and forgotten things, mostly from his childhood.



Paulâs book tourâs fourth readingâafter another in Brooklyn and one at a Barnes & Noble in the financial districtâwas in Ohio, on September 11. Calvin, 18, and Maggie, 17, seniors in high school whoâd been friends since middle school and were currently in a relationship, had invited Paul and Erin and other âinternet friendsâ to read at a music festival and stay two nights in Calvinâs parentsâ âmansion,â as Paul called it.

The day after the reading Paul and Erin ingested a little LSD and shared a chocolate containing psilocybin mushrooms and sat in sunlight in Calvinâs backyard, which had a hot tub and swimming pool and skateboard ramp and basketball hoop, âworking on thingsâ on their MacBooks. When Calvin returned from school they got in his SUV to go to Whole Foods, where Maggie was meeting them after work at American Apparel, and shared another chocolate. Calvin, who hadnât wanted any, meekly asked if maybe heâd feel good if he ate only a small piece, seeming like he wanted to be encouraged to try.

âWe already ate it,â said Paul, and laughed a little, in the backseat.

Erin, in the front passenger seat, was still holding a piece. Hearing Calvin she had seemed to slow its movement toward her mouth. She made a quiet, inquisitive noise and glanced slightly toward Paul, then resumed a normal speed and placed it inside her mouth. Paul lay on his back for most of the drive, sometimes sitting to noncommittally mumble something relevant, including that he liked Stereolab and Rainer Maria, to what he could hear of Calvin and Erinâs conversation. Walking toward Whole Foods, across its parking lot, Paul said he was âbeginning to feel the LSD, maybe.â

âReally?â said Erin. âI feel . . .â

âI donât know,â said Paul.

âI canât tell what I feel,â said Erin, and automatic doors opened and they entered the produce section, where they held and examined different coconuts. Calvin stood looking back, seeming tired and a little afraid, like a reclusive uncle supervising his unruly niece and outgoing nephew.

âYou should get one,â said Paul. âItâs refreshing.â

âIâm . . . allergic,â said Calvin a little nervously.

âShit,â said Paul grinning. âI forgot. Again. Sorry.â

The next few minutes, while Paul and Erin went to three different sectionsâbutcher, pizza, sushiâto get their coconuts opened, Calvin remained at a far distance, randomly and inattentively picking up and looking at things and sometimes glancing at Paul and Erin with a worried, socially anxious expression. Something about Calvin, maybe a corresponding distance or that they had similar body types, reminded Paul of Michelle, the night of the magazine-release party, waiting with slack posture at a red light, before she touched his arm and leaned on the metal fence. Paul, in line to pay, considered saying the word âKafkaesqueâ to describe getting their coconuts opened, but was distracted by an eerily familiar actressâs smiling face on a magazine cover and remained silent, then paid and maneuvered to a booth and sat by Erin, across from Calvin, who stared at them with wet eyes and a beseeching, insatiable, inhibited expression that alternated between Paul and Erin to keep both, Paul thought, locked into his meekly laser-like gaze. Paul held his left hand like a visor to his forehead and looked down and sometimes said âoh my god.â Whenever he glanced at Erin, who seemed to be enjoyably displaying an unceasing grin, he laughed uncontrollably and, due to the contrast with Calvinâs alienated demeanor, felt more uncomfortable. Unsure how to stop grinning, or what to do, he left the booth for straws. When he returned, after feeling mischievous and Gollum-like for two to three minutes while trying to secretly record Erin and Calvin with his iPhone, he lowered himself skillfully, he felt, in a 180-degree turn, like that of a screw, to a seated position, flinging a straw at Erin while connecting the awning of his left hand to his forehead. He moved his coconut to his lap and heard a partially metallic, imaginary-sounding noise. He stared without comprehension, but also without confusion, at Calvinâs body, which was hunched close to the table with demonically jutting shoulder blades rising and falling in rhythm to what sounded like a computer-generated squawking. The cube of space containing Calvin seemed to be reconfiguring itself, against passive resistance from the preexisting configuration of Calvin, mutating him in a process of computerization. Paul thought he was witnessing a kind of special effect, then realized Calvin was imitating a pterodactyl.

âI feel so much better now,â said Calvin. âJust doing what I want . . . what I want to do . . . yeah. Before, I was holding back, so I felt bad. I feel so much better now.â

âYou were making pterodactyl noises,â said Paul in disbelief.

Maggie appeared as a desultory object, rapidly approaching the booth in a horizontal glide, seeming unnaturally small and eerily low to the ground. âLSDs, LSDs,â she was saying in a high-pitched, taunting, witch-like voice. Paul, who was laughing and repeatedly saying âoh my godâ and variations of âI canât believe this is happening,â heard Calvin say âtheyâre not on LSD.â Maggie said âmagic mushroomsâ and seemed to be imitating an elf as she entered the booth behind Erin and Paul, who heard Erin say âweâre on LSD and mushrooms,â and briefly visualized the main character from Willow, the dwarf with magical powers. Things seemed defectively quiet, like before an explosion in a movie, the five to ten seconds before Maggie rose in the booth behind Paul, who turned and saw a faceless mound: Maggie, with her entire head inside a black beanie, saying âis this the front of me or back.â



In the parking lot Maggie went alone to her car. Calvin was backing out of his parking space when Paul, leaning forward from the backseat, said he wanted to be in Maggieâs car. Calvin braked and asked what to do, alternately looking at Paul and Erin with a helpless, besieged expression. Paul looked down a little, as if to suspend an intensity of visual input, to allow his brain to better focus on the question, but he wasnât thinking about the question, or anything, except maybe something about how he wasnât thinking anything, or was having problems thinking.

âI donât know what to do,â said Calvin incredulously. âShould I call Maggie?â

âNo,â said Paul after a few seconds.

âMaggie already left, I think,â said Calvin.

âLetâs just go,â said Paul.

âBut . . . if you want to be in Maggieâs car.â

âI want to be here now.â

âIf you . . . are you sure?â

âI want to be in this car. Maggieâs car is small.â

âAre you sure?â

âYes,â said Paul leaning against the front passenger seat, aware of the distant municipality of the SUVâs lighted dashboard. Things seemed darker to him than expected, a few minutes later, on the highway. The unlighted space, all around himâand, outside the SUV, the trees, skyâseemed more visible, by being blacker, or a higher resolution of blackness, almost silvery with detail, than normal, instead of what heâd sometimes and increasingly sensed, the past two months, mostly in his room, since one night when, supine on his yoga mat, his eyes, while open, had felt closed, or farther back in his head, and his room had seemed âliterally darker,â heâd thought, as if the bulb attached to his non-working ceiling fan had been secretly replaced, or like he was deeper inside the cave of himself than heâd been before and didnât know why. âMy face . . . it feels like itâs moving backward,â Calvin was saying in a surprised, confused voice. âIt keeps floating into me . . . itself . . . repeatedly.â

âJesus,â said Paul. âWhy?â

âPercocet. And a little Codeine.â

âI didnât know youâve been on those.â

âI told you . . . at the house.â

âJesus,â said Paul. âI remember now.â

They began talking about a Lil Wayne documentary that focused on Lil Wayneâs âdrug problem,â which Lil Wayne denied. Paul felt it was bleak and depressing that the film-makers superimposed their views onto Lil Wayne. Calvin seemed to agree with the documentary. Paul tried, with Erin, who agreed with him, he felt, to convey (mostly by slowly saying variations of ânoâ and âI canât think right nowâ) that there was no such thing as a âdrug problemâ or even âdrugsââ unless anything anyone ever did or thought or felt was considered both a drug and a problemâin that each thought or feeling or object, seen or touched or absorbed or remembered, at whatever coordinate of space-time, would have a unique effect, which each person, at each moment of their life, could view as a problem, or not.



In Calvinâs room, supine on carpet, Paul felt circumstantially immobile, like a turtle on its back, and that Calvin and Maggie were pressuring him to decide on an activity. Then he was sitting on the edge of a bed, staring at an area of carpet near his black-socked feet, vaguely aware of his inability to move or think and of people waiting for him to answer a question. He grinned after hearing himself, in his memory of three or four seconds ago, say âI donât know what to doâ very slowly, as if each word had been carefully selected, with attention to accuracy and concision. Erin silently exited Calvinâs bathroom and left the room in a manner, Paul vaguely felt, like she was smuggling herself elsewhere. Paul heard Maggie say âall right, weâre going to the hot tubâ and remain in the top left corner of his vision a few seconds before vanishing. Paul walked lethargically into the bathroom, removed his clothes, stood naked in Calvinâs room struggling to insert his left leg into his boxer shortsâ left hole, which kept collapsing shut and distortedly reappearing as part of a slowly rippling infinity symbol, tottering on one leg sometimes and quietly falling onceâmostly deliberately, anticipating a brief rolling sensation and a respite on the thick carpetâbefore succeeding and, after staring catatonically at nothing for a vague amount of time, aware of something simian about his posture and jaw, carefully going downstairs.

In the backyard, a few minutes later, Paul and Erin, holding each otherâs arms in an indiscernibly feigned kind of fear, hesitated before advancing, barefoot on the spiky and yielding grass, into the area of darkness Calvin and Maggie, after testing the swimming poolâs water as too cold, had gone. Paul stopped moving when he saw the disturbing statue of a Greek god wearing a gorilla mask, which Calvin, that afternoon, had said someone put on last Halloween, then abandoned Erin by running ahead, on his toes a little. As he slightly leaped, followed closely by Erin, into the hot tub, he imagined his head shooting like a yanked thing toward concrete. He surfaced after exaggeratedly, unnecessarily allowing the water to absorb his impact, then stared in disbelief at a balled-up Maggie rolling forward and back like a notorious, performing snail. âOh my god,â he said, aware his and Erinâs feet were deliberately touching. âLook at Maggie. What is she doing?â

âI was doing water sit-ups,â said Maggie.

âI canât believe . . . that,â said Paul. âHave you ever done that?â

âNo,â said Maggie. âWhat if we were all obese right now?â

âThe water would be displaced,â said Paul without thinking, and people laughed. Paul felt surprised he was able to cause authentic laughter at his handicapped level of functioning. The above-water parts of him were waiting patiently, he thought while staring at the soil beneath the bushes a few feet beyond the hot tub and remembering disliking the presence of soil while in swimming pools as a child in Florida, for the laughter to end and something else to begin. He became aware of himself saying âwhat would we be talking about right now if we were obese?â and, comprehending himself as the extemporaneous source of what seemed to be an immensely interesting question, felt a sensation of awe. He remained motionless, with eyeballs inattentively fixated on the obscure pattern of the bushes behind and to the left of Calvin and an anticipatory nervousness, as he imagined staring at each person, in turn, to confirmâor convey, depending on the personâthat, despite his impaired functioning, he had, unforeseen to anyone, including himself, asked a question of nearly unbelievable insight.

âWe would talk about if we were skinny,â said Maggie.

âNo, because it would be too depressing,â said Paul, surprised again by the power of his mind but less than before, a little suspicious now of his own enthusiasm.

âYouâre right,â said Calvin, and seemed to look at each person in disbeliefâwhich confused Paul because he had imagined doing that himself.

âWe would talk about food,â said Maggie.

âI feel like people are staring at me,â said Paul.

âMe too, a little,â said Erin.

âI wish I could see how Erin and I are like on mushrooms now,â said Paul.

âMe too,â said Erin.

âI was going to bring my camera but didnât want to get it wet,â said Maggie.

âPeople are staring at me weird, except Erin,â said Paul. âI wish someone was recording us.â

âJust ask me later and Iâll tell you,â said Maggie.

âLater,â said Paul, confused. âWhen?â

Calvin said it was time for Maggie to go home and they left seemingly instantly. Paul was aware of having waved at them and of having meekly said âbye, Maggie,â to himself, he realized, as he continued staring at where they had gone out of viewâto postpone interacting with Erin, whoâd been abnormally quiet most of the night, he uncertainly realized with increasing anxiety. Maggie should have stayed longer, because he and Erin were only visiting a few days, he thought earnestly for a few seconds before realizing, with only a little sheepishness, that Maggie had her own desires, separate from those of anyone else, which she expressed through her actions. Paul knew that, because he kept thinking about Maggie, his demeanor and behavior, when he finally acknowledged Erin, would appear, if not obviously feigned, to convey âI want to be elsewhereâ or âI want to be doing things in service of being elsewhere,â which Erin would easily discern, if she hadnât already. Paul moved his mouth to where water was bubbling and, partly facing away from Erin, said something about it feeling ânice.â Erin moved her mouth to a different area of similar bubbling. After ten to fifteen minutes Calvin appeared and said âyou guys can come inside now, Maggie went home,â seeming to have assumed they had been waiting for his approval to go inside. Paul had begun feeling comfortable and was confused why they couldnâtâand werenât asked if they wanted toâstay in the hot tub.



After showering in separate bathrooms Paul and Erin sat on Calvinâs carpeted floor. Calvin, covered by blankets up to his underarms, with his upper body propped by pillows, seemed like he was cautiously testing an unexpected feeling of health and energy while on his âdeath bed.â Maggie, he said in a worried and slightly fascinated voice, had wanted to perform oral sex on him, but he hadnât been aroused, which had upset her maybe. Erin said it was normal for sexual desire to leave sometimes. Calvin said he and Maggie hadnât had sex in four months. Paul said that seemed normal because theyâd been together three years and that Calvinâs drug useâPercocet, Codeine, Klonopin, Adderallâthe past few months, based on their emails and texts, seemed high, which probably had an effect. Then they discussed what to do now, for an activity, but couldnât decideâeach person seemed committed to not decidingâand became locked into what felt like a three-way staring contest, which they mutely sustained, each person alternating between the other two, for thirty to forty seconds, until Paul bluntly said he wanted to âgo for a walk with only Erin, outside,â and, after mumbling something incoherent about mushroomsâvaguely wanting to convey it was uncomfortable while on mushrooms to be around people not on mushroomsâquickly gained Erinâs assent and repeatedly positioned himself to displace, or push, her toward where he was going, until both were outside the room, in a dark hallway, where they huddled together and maneuvered grinning to winding stairs, which they descended holding hands, toward the front door.

They walked down the driveway into the upper-middle-class neighborhood with their inside arms folded up and against each other. Most front yards had one or two fashionably sculpted trees and two or more colorful Boy Scoutsâlike patches of flowers and plants in independent organization. Paul saw, in a side yard, a pale fence with the colorless, palatially melancholy glow of unicorns and remembered how in Florida, in the second of his familyâs three houses of increasing size, both his neighbors had built fencesârows of vertical, triangular-topped slats of wood that had seemed huge, medievalâaround their backyards. Paul said he felt like he was in Edward Scissorhands and they sat on a concrete embankment facing the street with their feet on a sidewalk. Paul slightly looked away as he said âthereâs so many stars hereâ without much interest.

Erin pointed and asked if one was moving.

âIn place, maybe,â said Paul uncertainly.

âIt looks like itâs vibrating,â said Erin.

âItâs, um, what thoughts do you have about UFOs?â said Paul looking away, as if not wanting Erin to hear him clearly. âIâm doing it . . . Iâm saying stereotypical things that people say while on mushrooms.â

âThatâs okay. UFOs are interesting.â

âI know itâs okay,â said Paul, and asked if Erin had experienced âany UFO things.â Erin said she wore purple and put glitter on her eyes every Friday in fourth grade because she thought, if she did, aliens would notice and take her away.

âThat seems really good,â said Paul feeling emotional. âAll purple?â

âNo. It just had to be one thing that was purple.â

âWhere did you think they would take you?â

âI donât think I thought about that,â said Erin. âJust âaway.â Anywhere.â

âWhat . . . did your classmates, or other people, think?â

âIâve never told anyone.â

âReally? But . . . itâs been so long.â

âI didnât have anyone to tell, really.â

âYou havenât told anyone except me?â

âNo. Let me think. No, I havenât.â

Paul had begun to vaguely feel that he already knew of a similar thingâsomething about purple glitter and fourth grade, maybe from a childrenâs bookâor was he remembering what he just heard? His voice sounded bored, he thought, as he told Erin about when, as a fourth or fifth grader, he really wanted to see a UFO and was on a plane and saw a brown dot and, without any excitement or sensation of discovery, repeatedly thought to himself that heâd seen a UFO. âI think I was aware at first that I was âfakingâ it,â said Paul uncertainly. âBut . . . I think I convinced myself so hard that I made myself forget that part . . . when I was aware, and I think I really believed I saw a UFO.â

âWhoa. Did you tell anyone you saw a UFO?â

âI donât think Iâve ever told anyone. I donât think I cared if anyone knew. I was just like, âI saw a UFO.â I think I was extremely bored. I was like a bored robot.â



The next night Erin and Paul met Cristine, 22âa mutual acquaintance from the internetâand Cristineâs friend Sally, 22, in a public park that was closed for the night. Cristine sold Paul eight 36mg Ritalin and ten psilocybin chocolates, wrapped in tinfoil, like little hockey pucks. They each ate a chocolate and walked through the park, to the end of a beach, where they sat in the gently fluorescent light of a half moon that looked like a jellyfish photographed, from far below, in mid-propulsion, its short tentacles momentarily inside itself.

In the distance, Clevelandâs three tallest buildings, each with a different shape and style of architecture and lighting, were spaced oddly far apart, like siblings in their thirties, in a zany sitcom. After spending their lives âhatingâ one another, in a small town, they moved to different cities and were happy, but then got coincidentally transferred by their employers to the same medium-size city. They were all named Frank. Paul felt reluctant to say anything weird because Cristine and Sally were behaving normally, with earnest expressions, as if pretending they werenât on mushrooms, except sometimes one would mention seeing beautiful colors, increasing Paulâs apprehension because earlier he and Erin had bonded over feeling alienated by people who focused on visuals, instead of people, while on hallucinogens. Deciding, after around fifteen minutes, to drive somewhere in two cars, they walked on the beach toward the parking lot. The clear moonlight sometimes fleetingly appeared, on Lake Erie, to their left, as thin layers of snow, resting on the surface of the water, as if painted on, or briefly riding the shoreward, foamy fronts of tiny waves before vanishing. Sallyâs car, on the highway, got a flat tire. Paul and Erin couldnât stop grinning, due to the mushrooms, sitting on a sidewalk in downtown Cleveland, waiting for AAA, as a frowning Sally, whose car had a missing window covered by a garbage bag, persistently bemoaned her situation without looking at anyone. Cristine, grinning sometimes at Paul and Erin, drove everyone, in Erinâs car, to Kent State University, where Paul and Erin walked far behind Cristine and Sally, on a slightly uphill sidewalk. âWhen you said that thing about glitter and purple clothing I felt vaguely like I already knew about it,â said Paul. âYou really havenât told anyone?â

âThe only person Iâve told is my friend Jennika.â

âYou said I was the only person youâve told.â

âI know,â said Erin. âI shouldnât have said that.â

âDid you forget? Yesterday?â

âNo, I knew. I was nervousâI thought I was talking too much.â

âBut I was asking you about it.â

âI thought I was boring you.â

âYou werenât,â said Paul. âAt all.â

âI just wanted to, like, âmove on.â â

âDonât do that. If I ask something I really want to know.â

âI know. I donât want to do that.â

âYou lied . . . to me,â said Paul, and felt dramatic and self-conscious. âWait, let me think. Iâm thinking if I were you . . . if I would lie about that. I think . . . yeah, I would, if I didnât want to talk about it.â He would if he didnât anticipate becoming close to the other person, or talking to them again. âI understand, I think.â He imagined Erinâs inattentive, half-hearted view of him as âvaguely, unsatisfactorily desirable,â like how he viewed most people. âI would lie, like that, in that situation. Are you sure you havenât written it somewhere? Like on your blog maybe?â

âIâm really sure. Iâm ninety percent sure.â

âOnly ninety percent? Thatâs, like, âunsure,â I feel.â

âIâm really sure. Iâm ninety-five percent sure.â

âYou can tellââ

âPaul,â said Erin, and grasped his forearm. They stopped walking. More aware of Erinâs perspective, looking at his face ( and not knowing what expression she saw or what he wanted to express), than of his own, Paul didnât know what to do, so went âafk,â he felt, and remained thereâaway from the keyboard of the screen of his faceâas Erin, looking at the inanimate object of his head, said âif I did I would tell youâ and, emphatically, âIâm not lying to you right now.â

âOkay,â said Paul, and they continued walking.

Sprinklers could be heard in the distance.

âI believe you,â said Paul.

âReally?â

âYeah. I havenât not believed you. I was just saying . . . maybe you got the idea or something similar to it from somewhere else, like a childrenâs book weâve both read, but we forgot about it, or something like that.â

âI donât think I did,â said Erin.

âI feel like I do that a lot.â

âMaybe,â said Erin quietly.



Around 1:30 a.m., after Cristine and Sally had left, Paul and Erin were walking in downtown Cleveland trying to find any open restaurant when they entered a hotel through an âemployees onlyâ door and ascended on an escalator and walked through dark corridors into an auditorium-like area, encountering no people. Paul imagined the building omni-directionally expanding at a rate exceeding their maximum running speed, so that this goalless, enjoyably calm exploration of a temperature-controlled, tritely uncanny interior would replace his life, with its book tour and Gmail and, he thought after a few seconds, âfood.â Would he agree to that? âYes,â he thought âmeaninglessly,â he knew, because heâd still be inside himself, the only place heâd ever be, that he could imagine, though maybe he didnât knowânot knowing seemed more likely.

At a Dennyâs near the airport Paul ordered a steak and minestrone soup. Erin ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and cheese sticks. They shared a 30mg Adderall and drove to the airport, listening to a â90s station, both immediately recognizing Natalie Imbrugliaâs âTorn,â whose lyrics, to a degree that Paul couldnât stop grinning, seemed to be a near-unbroken series of borderline non sequitur clichÃ©s. Erin had a public-speaking class in Baltimore, eight hours away, in nine and a half hours. At the airport Paul left eight psilocybin chocolates with Erin, who said she would bring them to his reading in Manhattan in four weeks, if not earlier. They hugged tightly, and Paul, whose flight to Minnesota was in four hours, said he wished they had more time to listen to â90s songs together and that he âhad a lot of fun,â with Erin, the past few days.



The next three days they texted regularly and, Paul felt, with equal attentiveness. Paul texted a photo of a display in the Mall of America of books titled I Can Make You Confident and I Can Make You Sleep with the author grinning on each cover. Erin texted a blurry photo of what seemed to be a headless mannequin wearing a white dress and said she was in Las Vegas at a cousinâs wedding. Then she texted less, and with less attention, and one night didnât respond to a photo Paul sent from a cafÃ© in Chicago, where he was staying for four days, of a Back to the Future posterâ



He was never in time

for his classes . . .



He wasnât in time

for his dinner . . .



Then one day . . .

he wasnât in his

time at all.



âuntil morning, when she texted âlolâ and that sheâd been asleep, but she didnât reciprocate a photo, or ask a question, so they stopped texting. Paul sensed she was busy with college and maybe one or more vague relationships, but allowed himself to become âobsessed,â to some degree, with her, anyway, reading all four years of her Facebook wall and, in one of Chicagoâs Whole Foods, one night looking at probably fifteen hundred of her friendsâ photos to find any she mightâve untagged.

In a cafÃ© in Ann Arbor around 10:30 p.m., two days later, Paul realized, when he remembered Erinâs existence by seeing her name in Gmail, heâd forgotten about her that entire day (over the next three weeks, whenever more than two or three days passed since they last communicated, which they did by email, every five to ten days, in a thread Erin began the day she dropped him off at the airport, Paul would have a similar realization of having forgotten about her for an amount of time). Around midnight he drove his rental car to a row of fast-food restaurants near the airport and slept in a McDonaldâs parking lot. When he woke, around 2:45 a.m., he bought and ate a Filet-O-Fish from the McDonaldâs drive-thru. While trying to discern what, from which fast-food restaurant, to buy and eat next, he idly imagined himself for more than ten minutes as the botched clone of himself, parked outside the mansion of the scientist who the original Paul paid to clone himself and paid again to âdestroy all informationâ regarding â[censored].â He drove across the street to a Checkers drive-thru and bought two apple pies, which he ate with little to no pleasure, almost unconsciously, while distractedly considering how once a bite of it was in his mouth, then chewed once or twice, there seemed to be no choice, at that point, but to swallow. He slept three hours, drove past McDonaldâs and Arbyâs, returned the rental car, rode a van as the only passenger to the airport, boarded the earliest flight to Boston.

Around two weeks later, in early October, he stayed for eight days in San Francisco in his own room, on the second floor of a house, which Danielâs ex-girlfriend and exgirlfriendâs sister shared. An employee at Twitter invited him to its headquarters, where he ate from two different buffets. Danielâs ex-girlfriendâs sisterâs boyfriend sold him MDMA and mushrooms, which he ate a medium-large dose of before his reading at the Booksmith, which was livestreamed on the internet. His publisher left him a voice mail the next afternoon, asking him to call them to discuss âsome problems.â He emailed them late that night apologizing for missing their call and said he was available by email. He met someone from Facebook and ingested LSD, which she declined, before watching Dave Eggers interview Judd Apatow for almost two hours in an auditorium. On her full-size mattress, three hours after the interview, they watched a forty-minute DVD of a Rube Goldberg machine and kissed a few minutes, then Paul âfingeredâ her and, after seeming to orgasm, she rolled over and slept.

In Los Angeles, the night before a panel discussion at UCLA on the topic of hipsters, after privately ingesting a little LSD, half a capsule of MDMA, a Ritalinâthe combination of which, at Paulâs tolerance levels, had the effect of slightly distorting and energizing his base feeling of depression, so that he also felt many of its related emotions, such as despair and aggravationâhe was designated, for some reason, to drive an NPR contributorâs car to a house party on the steepest street he had ever seen in person. After the house party, in a bar staffed by Asians, with Chinese and Vietnamese food, Paul saw and approached Taryn, who seemed happy to see him, to his mild surprise (theyâd only met once and vaguely, at the party where Paul put on âTodayâ by the Smashing Pumpkins). Taryn and a younger, sibling-like man, who at times seemed to be her boyfriend, but remained at a distance most of the night, went with Paul and the moderator of the next dayâs panel discussion and other people to an apartment whose only purpose, someone kept saying, was for partying in when bars had closed. Paul felt the same mysterious, vague attraction to Taryn he felt in Brooklyn but unlike then, when theyâd spoken probably three sentences to each other, they talked continuously, energetically. Taryn said she moved here a month ago after securing a full-time job as a copywriter for a fashion website, where her coworkers did, or did notâPaul became confused which, at some point, after realizing heâd laughed at bothâknow she had an MFA in poetry. Paul gradually remembered Taryn was friends with Caroline, that she and Carolineâand many of Paulâs acquaintances, including Shawn Olive, in Brooklynâhad been in the same one to three graduating classes for their MFAs in poetry at the New School and that most, or all, of them, as part of their curriculum, had read Paulâs first poetry book that he wrote the summer after graduating, in 2005, with a BA in journalism. The moderator of the next dayâs panel discussion approached Paul and Taryn and said he had bought cocaine for them from a former Olympic soccer player whose father, before recently dying, had operated a major drug cartel. Paul and Taryn were led to a dresser, scattered on which were playing cards. The former Olympic soccer player indicated a six of spades, beneath which was twenty dollarsâ worth of cocaine.



On UCLAâs campus the next night Paul photographed a piece of computer paper, taped crudely to a column, that said HIPSTER PANEL with an arrow pointing literally at the sky. In emails with the moderator of the panel discussion the past few weeks Paul had repeatedly half joked that he was going to âdominate the panelâ and now, backstage peaking on one and a half capsules of MDMA and two Ritalin and an energy drink, he began openly conveying the same message to the other seven panelists, including a cofounder of Vice, the only person getting paid, everyone seemed to know, who was shirtless with 20oz beer and reacted to Paulâs robot-like extroversion with what seemed like barely suppressed confusion, which Paul tried to resolve by overpowering any possible awkwardness with his temporary charisma, which resulted in what seemed to be intimidation but was maybe an intimidation-based attempt at a non-antagonistic guardianship, which caused Paul, who felt he solely wanted to interact with mutual sincerity, to hesitate a little, which maybe the cofounder of Vice sensed as anxiety because he slapped Paulâs shoulder three times painfully. In his state of medium euphoria, with intensely dull eyes and an overall cyborg-like demeanor, Paul stared briefly at the cofounder of Vice before turning around and moving away with an earnest, uncertain feeling of disappointment. Paul arguably dominated the panel in a private way by multitasking (1) earnestly speaking on the topic of hipsters with uncharacteristic willingness to engage a matter of semantics (2) photographing other panelists and the audience and recording two videos with his iPhone (3) tweeting three times (4) interrupting people two or three times to defend audience members from the cofounder of Viceâs fashion criticisms (5) sustaining text conversations with Mia, who around a year ago had messaged Paul on Facebook, and Taryn, both of whom were alone in the audience of three to four hundred students and twenty to forty journalists (6) being asked the most questions during the Q&A, though almost all were negative and partially rhetorical, including why he kept writing after the âexcrementâ that was his previous book.

After the Q&A, during which Taryn had left due to a prior obligation, Paul talked a few minutes to Mia, vaguely remembering that she had lived, or something, in Crispin Gloverâs âcastle,â and wanted to spend more time with her, or Taryn, or the moderator, or the other panelists, at whatever post-panel party was probably beginning, but was driven in a sort of rush to the airport by two UCLA students, who in the front seats, talking to each other in voices Paul couldnât hear, for some reason, maybe because a window was open, seemed far away and illusory. At the airport Paul saw he had another voice mail from his publisher and felt dread, then realized he was accidentally listening to it and that it was overâa six-second message asking Paul to âpleaseâ call them. Paul rested his head on his dining tray, mostly facedown and awake, during the flight to Minnesota, where after six hours of a seven-hour layover, a few minutes after putting his things in his backpack and standing to wait to get on a plane, he got a long email from his mother, saying she knew she had promised she wouldnât anymore, but felt that she must, as a parent, continue telling Paul that she disapproved of his drug use. Paul could feel his intensely aggravated expression as he typed around three thousand words of stream-of-consciousness information about drugs and why the only way his mother could influence him to use less would be if she didnât view them as good or bad, but learned about them, as a friend instead of a parent, because he was 27, all of which heâd stated, he knew, clearer and more convincingly, in dozens of emails the past four months to seemingly no lasting effect. His mother replied in a manner like his emailâthe longest heâd sent from an iPhoneâhad no effect on her and he replied again, expressing futility, then flew to Philadelphia, where after a bleakly sober reading in a tiny bookstore, which sold only used and rare books, he slept on a mostly empty bus, dropping him off in Brooklynâs Chinatown, a place heâd forgotten existed.



In his room, around 2:30 a.m., he read a 2:12 a.m. email from Erin that said sheâd âbeen using a lot of mental space to think about definitely ending a yearlong, âon-and-off,â semi-vague relationship and actually did tonightââin reference to someone named Beauâand that she was aware of the insufficiency of her email, half the length of Paulâs email, from nine days ago, but wanted to say before sleeping that she was still coming, if it was âstill okay,â she said, to Paulâs reading tomorrow and would bring the psilocybin chocolates Paul left with her one month ago as previously discussed.

Increasingly, as his memory occupied less of his consciousness, the past four to six months, whenever Paul sensed familiarity in the beginnings of a thought or feeling he would passively focus on intuiting it in entirety, predicting its elaboration and rhetoric in the presence of logic and world-view like a ballâs trajectory and destination in the presence of gravity and weather. If he recognized the thought or feeling, and didnât want it repeated, heâd end its formation by focusing elsewhere, like how someone searching for a lost dog on a field at night wouldnât approach the silhouette of a tree. Paul, reading Erinâs email, was vaguely aware of himself considering that, to some degree, Erin was âusing himâ to make Beau jealous, or to stay busy while Beau was doing other things maybeâthat if things had worked with Beau she might not be coming tomorrow.

Without full awareness of what heâd begun to think Paul deliberately stopped thinking and texted: âYes. Would like if you come, see you tomorrow hopefully.â He called his publisher at 3:04 a.m., leaving a voice mail saying he understood what they probably wanted to say, that he was sorry and wouldnât do it againâvaguely he remembered that they had, at some point, told him they disapproved of him using mushrooms at a readingâand was available by email, then slept.



Paul was in Bobst Library around 3:30 p.m. and had just ingested a capsule of MDMA when Erin texted that she was around fifty minutes away. Paul walked ten blocks to the bookstore and sat on a tiny bench in the fiction section and tweeted and looked at his Gmail account. Erin texted she was in the store and had eaten a chocolate. Paul was surprised she was with a male friend, whom she introduced as a former coworker named Gary, who lived in Brooklyn.

âHeâs gay,â said Erin, and gave Paul a chocolate, which he chewed into a gluey paste and swallowed with lemon water from the bookstoreâs cafÃ©. After the reading Paul, Erin, and Gary walked to a bar for someoneâs 33rd birthday. Gary left after around ten minutes and Erin said he had whispered in her ear that he felt sad and wanted to talk. âI told him I couldnât now, Iâm on mushrooms,â said Erin. âThen he asked me for mushrooms. I said I didnât have any and he probably shouldnât have them now anyway and Iâd call him tomorrow.â



Around three hours later Paul and Erin were stomach-down on Paulâs mattress watching YouTube videos of people answering the same questions sober and on hallucinogens. Paul, who kept clicking new videos, was amused by how he seemed to be comfortably and energetically, with only a little self-consciousness, âhaving fun,â he kept thinking, in contrast to Erin, who seemed shy in a tired, depressed, distracted manner indicating to Paul that she was maybe thinking about someone else, probably Beau, whom she would probably rather be with, at the moment, instead of Paul, who felt intriguedâand further amusedâwhy he was not affected by this information, which normally would make it impossible for him to enjoy anything. They slept without touching, woke in the afternoon, drove to Manhattan, where they separately âworked on thingsâ (Paul in the library, Erin in a Starbucks) until 9:30 p.m., when they ate chocolates and watched a Woody Allen movie, which ended after midnight, on October 15, Erinâs 25th birthday. Paul said he wanted to buy her an expensive dinner and they went in an Italian restaurant that seemed moderately expensive, sat in a corner booth, ordered medium-rare steaks and a shrimp appetizer. Erin asked if she should answer a call from Beau, whoâd been calling and texting all night, she said.

âIf you want, yeah,â said Paul looking down a little.

Erin spoke to Beau in a jarringly, briefly absurdly different voiceâone of impatient, dominating aggressionâthan Paul (who recognized the voice as similar to how he spoke, as a child, to his mother) had ever heard her use and which increased his interest in her, knowing she was capable of what to Paul was her opposite. After around fifty seconds, at a moment when she had the opportunity, Paul felt, based on hearing her side of what sounded like a mutual voicing of vague aggravation, to tactfully end the call and unambiguously convey she viewed their relationship as finished, Erin instead prolonged the call by speaking angrily, with sudden emotion indicating she wasnât indifferent. Paul felt dizzy with the realization, as Erin continued talking in a manner like sheâd forgotten his presence, that his view of her was uncontrollably changing, that parts of him were earnestly, if dramatically, no longer viewing her as a romantic possibility. He intuited a hidden intimacy in Erin and Beauâs hostility, a psychic collaborationâunconscious, or maybe conscious for one of themâassembling the structures, located days or weeks from now, where they would meet again to apologize and forgive and, while rescinding their insults, encouraged by the grammar and syntax and psychology of contrasts, near-automatically convey adoration, gratitude, compliments. Was this how people sustained relationships and sanity? By uninhibitedly expressing resentment to unconsciously contrast an amount of future indifference into affection? With quickly metabolized disappointment and a brief, vague, almost feigned restructuring of the mirage-like pile of miscellaneous items of his life Paul acclimated himself to this new reality, in which he would talk to Erin less and never with full attention, always distracted by, if not someone else, the ever-present silhouette of a possible someone else. Erin somewhat abruptly ended the call and asked if it had been entertaining, or interesting, or at least not too boring.

âI was really interested.â

âIt was okay? Not boring?â

âNo. I felt high levels of interest.â

âOh,â said Erin. âGood.â

âI was surprised. You sounded angry.â

âYeah,â said Erin. âI was angry.â

âThere was one part . . . when you started fighting more, instead of stopping, I felt, like, afraid,â said Paul, and Erin said she knew what part he was referencing and that she had specifically considered if he would be entertained, or not, and had felt uncertain. As a waiter served their medium-rare steaks and, on multicolored rice, cooked into fetal positions, eight medium-large shrimp, Paul realized with some confusion that he might have overreacted. Staring at the herbed butter, flecked and large as a soap sample, on his steak, he was unsure what, if he had overreacted, had been the cause. It occurred to him that, in the past, in college, he would have later analyzed this, in bed, with eyes closed, studying the chronology of imagesâmemories, heâd realized at some point, were images, which one could crudely arrange into slideshows or, with effort, sort of GIFs, maybeâbut now, unless he wrote about it, storing the information where his brain couldnât erase it, place it behind a toll, or inadvertently scramble its organization, or change it gradually, by increments smaller than he could discern, without his knowledge, so it became both lost and unrecognizable, he probably wouldnât remember most of this in a few days and, after weeks or months, he wouldnât know it had been forgotten, like a barn seen from inside a moving train that is later torn down, its wood carried elsewhere on trucks.

Erin was flying to the College of Coastal Georgia in the morning to read to writing students and stay five to ten days as a kind of vacation. They confirmed to meet in Baltimore in three weeks, at the last reading of Paulâs book tour, to film themselves answering questions, on MDMA and while sober, to edit into videos like theyâd seen on YouTube.



In Montreal, three days later, beneath a uniformly cloudy expanse, which glowed with the same intensity and asbestos-y texture everywhere, seeming less like a sky than the cloud-colored surface of a cold, hollowed-out sun, close enough to obstruct its own curvature, Paul walked slowly and aimlessly, sometimes standing in place, like an arctic explorer, noticing almost no other people and that something, on a general level, seemed familiar. He drank coffee and looked at the internet in a cafÃ©, feeling gloomy and vertiginous when, after three hours, he went outside, where it had gotten significantly colder, to walk to a juice bar, twelve blocks away, near the cafÃ© where the worldâs largest French-language radio station was interviewing him in an hour.

The sky darkened and was now almost cloudless, like it had been gently suctioned from an interplanetary pressure system. As a red truck, clean and bright as a toy, passed on the street, Paul realized Montreal, with its narrower streets and cute beverage sizes and smaller vehicles, reminded him of Berlin. Heâd gone alone to Berlin early in his relationship with Michelle for the German edition of his first novelâa year and a half ago, in March 2009, he calculated after two to three minutes of focused effort containing two long pauses without thoughts, but it felt more than five years away, like part of himself, while in Berlin, had gotten lost on its way here, taking more than five years instead of one and a half, a feeling that confused Paul, who stopped thinking, then realized he hadnât thought about Erin, or maybe any person, today and that he had no romantic prospects. He visualized the black dot of the top of his headâfrom an aerial view of two blocksâslowing to a standstill and remaining motionless on the sidewalk as other dots passed in either direction and the darkening city gradually brightened with artificial lights, the movie of his life finally ending, the credits scrolling down the screen.

Shivering, he walked with increasing speed toward the juice bar, wanting to stop moving in a way that heâd disappear, which didnât seem possible. He ingested two capsules of MDMA with a green smoothie, then walked four blocks to a cafÃ© where he was interviewed by a small, balding, frequently laughing man of indiscernible age for around forty-five minutes, during which Paul smiled uncontrollably, with almost continuously unfocused eyes, unable to discern stillness in the single image of everything, containing him in a sphere of blurrily passing scenery. He felt low in his seat, warming his hands on a cup of tea, and was sometimes aware that his face was arbitrarily pointing in strange directions, as if to consider his thoughts, or the interviewerâs questions, from various perspectives, probably seeming genuinely eccentric or weirdly, insanely pretentious. His teeth chattered and his upper body sometimes âconvulsed,â he thought with brief interest, on the walk to the Drawn & Quarterly bookstore, where he sat absently in the audience in the back row with a slouched posture and, with a sensation of entering his body in medias res, at a moment when a decision, approved without his input, was about to actualize, said âis David Foster Wallace really big in America?â at a speaking volume to no one, it seemed.

Five or six people, ahead of him, facing the stage, which he also faced, shifted a little in their seats but didnât turn around. Paul realized heâd said âAmericaâ not âCanadaâ and, in his state of near immunity from shame and/or anxiety, acknowledged a theoretical embarrassment, which someone not on MDMA, in his situation, might experience. For one or two seconds, with tepid disappointment toward himself, before moving nearer to the stage, Paul dimly believed people had ignored him because they knew he was on drugs and were afraid he might say more things that would humiliate and further expose himself, in a completely non-funny way, as pathetic and troubling and drug-addled and sad. After the reading, then a Q&Aâduring which someone asked if Paul felt like his life had changed the past few years and he said no, which he qualified by saying it had, then after a pause said he honestly felt unable to answer accuratelyâthe owner of Drawn & Quarterly approached and thanked Paul for coming to Montreal. Paul pitched a childrenâs book, to be illustrated by a known graphic novelist whoâd confirmed interest, based on one of his poemsâ



when i was five i went



fishing with my family



when i was five



i went fishing with my family



my dad caught a turtle



my mom caught a snapper



my brother caught a crab



i caught a whale



that night we ate crab



the next night we ate turtle



the next night we ate snapper



the next night we ate whale



the next night we ate whale



the next night we ate whale



the next night we ate whale



the next night we ate whale



the next night we ate whale



âwith each line on its own page and the last line repeated as many times as needed. Maybe a different artist could illustrate each page to create a sort of anthology. As a childrenâs book, due to the content, it would appeal to college students and teenagers and be a popular gift choice. It could become âone of those things,â said Paul, who considered, at one point, while talking, if his behavior might be a little tactless and easily concluded it might be to ânormal peopleâ but not the owner of Drawn & Quarterly, which had published many books, among Paulâs favorites, sympathetic to socially dysfunctional characters.

When Paul finished talking, the owner, whoâd sustained a polite, slightly tense smile and a tired and unblinking gaze, said âthank youâ and walked away.



Paulâs main feeling, an hour and a half later, in a cafÃ© with six to eight strangers, staring at his hands wrapped tightly around his teacup, was an excruciating combination of social anxiety and, as the MDMA stopped working, disintegrating functioning, including tremulous fingers and what felt like an inability to control or predict the volume and pitch of his voice and a helpless sensation that his faceâespecially if he tried to mollify its severe appearance, which he would need to do if anyone asked him a questionâmight begin quivering or flinching uncontrollably. His memory of what he now viewed as a âmajor, egregious faux pas,â his interaction with Drawn & Quarterlyâs owner, was vague and nonlinear and dominated by a troubling suspicion that, with his pitch of a book in a genre Drawn & Quarterly didnât publish, heâd interrupted the ownerâs initial greeting.

Hiding in the bathroom, Paul remembered that, when he processed the identity of the owner, approaching from maybe six feet away, heâd felt a sensation not unlike clicking âsendâ for a finished draft of a long email, setting off his childrenâs book pitch. He probably had referenced his poem as if it were common knowledge because he didnât know how he could have conveyed its effect without reciting it in full. He remembered, or thought he remembered, seeing disappointment inside the ownerâs eyesâa faint off-coloring, like a woundless scar, a millimeter behind the corneaâwhich had seemed sad in a manner like his life (operating his publishing company, living in the same apartment for twenty years, accumulating obligations in the bleak world of graphic novels) was a pure, omnipresent, concrete reminder, Paul vaguely imagined while standing in a stall staring at his iPhone, that he was the only entity building and embellishing and imperialistically expanding his own unhappiness.



Around midnight, after everyone in the cafÃ© had gone to a concert, Paul was alone in the Drawn & Quarterly book-storeâs managerâs apartment. He looked at Twitter for what felt like twenty minutes, alternating hands to hold his iPhone ten to fifteen inches above his face. He emailed Charlesâ



Iâm lying in bed on a sofa



Feel strongly like I simply want to relate my feelings of bleakness in this email



My legs feel cold



âwith âFeeling bleakâ as the subject. He was looking at Twitter again, a few minutes later, when for the fifth or sixth time since getting it in August he dropped his iPhone on his face, which did not register in its expression that anything had happened until after impact. He considered emailing Charles that his iPhone fell on his face. Then he tried to do what he couldnât specifically remember having done since collegeâhe chose one of his favorite songs and, with a meekly earnest sympathy toward himself, listened to it on repeat at a high volume and tried to focus only on the drums, or bass guitar, until he was drowsy and decontextualized and memoryless, when he would half-unconsciously remove his earphones and turn off the music, careful not to be noticed and assimilated by the world, and disappear into the reachable mirage of sleep.

But he couldnât focus on the music. He couldnât ignore a feeling that he wasnât aloneâthat, in the brain of the universe, where everything that happened was concurrently recorded as public and indestructible data, he was already partially with everyone else that had died. The information of his existence, the etching of which into space-time was his experience of life, was being studied by millions of entities, billions of years from now, who knew him better than he would ever know himself. They knew everything about him, even his current thoughts, in their exact vagueness, as he moved distractedly toward sleep, studying him in their equivalent of middle school âmaybe,â thought some fleeting aspect of Paulâs consciousness, unaware what it was referencing.



Paul arrived in Toronto the next night on a Megabus, then rode two city buses to the apartment of a Type Books employee and his girlfriend and slept on a sofa. In Whole Foods the next day, for around five hours, he ate watermelon and looked at the internet and typed answers to an email interview. He walked to a cafÃ© near Type Books and asked on one of the two threads on 4chan about him that, for some reason, had appeared the last two daysâand, with two to four hundred posts each, 90 to 95 percent derogatory, were the two longest threads on him that heâd ever seenâif anyone in Toronto could sell him MDMA or mushrooms within two hours. Someone named Rodrigo, whoâd recently moved here from San Francisco, Paul discerned via Facebook, emailed that he could get mushrooms and maybe MDMA but not until after Paulâs reading.

In Type Books people stood in an encroaching half circle around a nervously grinning Paul, seated on a stool, âcompletely exposed,â he felt, as an employee read a long, admiring, complicated introduction that seemed like it had incorporated sections of a dissertation. Paul, appearing sometimes openly frightened, honestly answered âI donât knowâ for almost every question during the Q&A, then in each ensuing silence, feeling pressure to elaborate, mumbled sentence fragments he knew were untrue or inaccurate before, in closing, reiterating âI donât know.â Near the end, while saying âbut I donât really know,â he stuttered a little. After the reading he went to a restaurant with four Type Books employees and their friend Alethia, 22, who had published around six hundred articles since leaving college two years ago to write for Torontoâs leading alt weekly. Paul asked if Alethia, whom he felt attracted to and curious about, wanted to interview him while, as a journalistic angle, he was âon MDMA.â

In Rodrigoâs apartment, a few hours later, Paul searched his name in Alethiaâs email accountâsigned in on Rodrigoâs tiny, malformed-looking, non-MacBook laptopâwhile she was in the bathroom and saw she had pitched an article on him, two months ago, to the Toronto Sun, who had not responded, it seemed. Paul and Rodrigo each swallowed a capsule of MDMA. Paul said he felt ânothingâ and swallowed another and, when it began taking effect, repeatedly encouraged Alethia to also ingest MDMA, âfor the interview,â but she declined, citing that when she tried LSD she rode a bus around Toronto for five hours. Rodrigo lay with his girlfriend on his bed as Paul and Alethia sat on beanbags on the floor and talked for two and a half hours, during which Paul sometimes wanted to hug or kiss Alethia, whose default expression, it seemed, was âworried,â sometimes in an endearingly doe-like manner and sometimes like it was an effect of her job, as a full-time journalist, with its deadlines and copyediting, Paul thought half sarcastically more than once. Alethia said âyou were saying youâve been doing readings on drugs because it makes you feel more comfortableâ and asked why.

âUm, actually, I just think itâs more fun.â

âMore fun for you, or the people who are there?â

âIn my view itâs more fun for everyone,â said Paul.

âSo when you did that reading a few weeks ago on mushrooms . . . you stopped after two minutes?â

âUm,â said Paul. âTwo minutes?â

âYeah. Is that what happened?â

âWhat reading?â

âOh. I donât know . . . a few weeks ago.â

âThe Booksmith?â

âYeah. In San Francisco.â

âOh. I was seeing âtribal patternsâ on the paper, because I was staring at it on mushrooms, and I felt like I was sweating, and I kept thinking âHunter S. Thompson.â Then I felt like I couldnât go on anymore. I was preparing to say something like âIâm having a bad drug experience, I need to go home.â But I looked up, at the people, and regained control.â



An hour later they were discussing a recent trend of Megabus accidents, described by Paul, who was riding a Megabus to Manhattan tomorrow, as âlike, twenty people dying five times in the last few days,â when Alethia asked if Paul was worried heâd be âthe next to die.â

âNo. I donât care if I die.â

âUm,â said Alethia laughing.

âI feel like I honestly donât care if I die.â

âReally? Youâre not worried about dying?â

âNo, I think. Iâm ready to die whenever.â

âBecause youâve written enough books?â

âNo, no,â said Paul shaking his head a little. âI donât know. Iâm just ready to die. Life just seems like . . . itâs fine if I die. Once Iâm dead Iâm dead.â Rodrigo from his bed said âbut in an interview you talk about eating healthy and not smoking because youâll be more productive.â Paul said health and drugs and being productive were all in service of feeling good. Alethia said she took Ritalin almost every day, from ages 8 to 12, for âattention deficit disorder.â Paul said âthat seems horribleâ and âthat mustâve changed you.â

âYeah, I think it did,â said Alethia. âI think it did.â

âPeople who take the most drugs by far are the kidsââ

âItâs so true,â said Alethia.

ââwho get prescribed them,â said Paul.

âWhoâs, like, your closest friend?â

âI just felt, like . . . really alone when you said that.â

âOh no! Iâm sorry.â

âWait, there has to be someone,â said Paul grinning. âI feel like I have close friends but we stop talking. Right now, I guess, what person do I feel closest to?â

âYeah,â said Alethia.

âUm, I canât remember right now. I feel close to different people over sets of days. Like if Iâve been texting someone, but then Iâll forget about them.â

âDo you sometimes feel like it sucksâto just, like, live in the world?â

âWhat do you mean?â said Paul slowly.

âLike, that the world canât provide us with enough to satisfy us.â

âNo,â said Paul after around ten seconds, and covered his face with his hands. âI mean . . . the world is good enough, based on evidence, because I havenât killed myself. Like, if I killed myself . . . I could say the world is bad, on average.â

âLike definitively,â said Alethia.

âOn average,â said Paul through his hands. âSince the urge to kill myself isnât so strong that I actually kill myself, the world is worth living in.â



â¢ â¢ â¢



Alethia left around 4:30 a.m., easily declining Paulâs suggestions, bordering on âpleas,â he felt, that she stay. Rodrigo and his girlfriend seemed asleep. Sitting on a sofa, in the common room, Paul texted Alethia: âThis is Paul. Good night, glad we met.â Alethia responded: âMe too. You are wonderful.â Paul lay on the sofa, bristling with wakefulness, for around forty minutes, then put his MacBook in his backpack and wrote a two-sentence note to Rodrigo and walked outside into a silvery, wintry light.

On a Megabus to New York Cityâfor around fifteen hours, due to a two-hour delay in Buffaloâhe read all he could find by Alethia on the internet, becoming more âobsessed,â he felt, after each article, lying on his back across two seats with knees bent, twice dropping his iPhone onto his face. His interest in Alethia naturally decreased, the next few days, then they texted a few times and he felt renewed obsession, but he didnât like her impersonal tone in their emails discussing their interviewâwhich sheâd spent eight hours transcribingâand, less than a week after they met, all he felt toward her, to his weak amusement, was an unexamined combination of indifference and vague resentment, which he described in an email to Charles, whose previous knowledge of Alethia was that Paul liked her âa lot,â as âstrong aversion,â only half joking. Paulâs next email to Charles said âI feel like I âhateâ herâ and that it seemed, by the bureaucratic language and curtness of Alethiaâs emails, like she also âhatedâ him, that they âhatedâ each other.



On Halloween afternoon, in the library, Paul read an account of his Montreal reading, when he was on two capsules of MDMA, describing him as âcharismatic, articulate, and friendly.â

He read an account of his Toronto reading, when heâd been sober, describing him as âmonosyllabic,â âawkward,â âstilted and unfriendlyâ within a disapproval of his oeuvre, itself vaguely within a disapproval of contemporary culture and, by way of a link to someone elseâs essay, the internet.



After his book tourâs last reading, on November 4, in Baltimore, Paul declined multiple dinner and bar invitations and went with Erin to her apartmentâa bedroom, bathroom, tiny kitchen, TV roomâwhere, using iMovie on Erinâs MacBook, they recorded themselves on MDMA answering questions each had prepared for the other, then continued recording, sitting on Erinâs bed, as they showed each other things on the internet, wanting to later be able to see how they behaved while on MDMA. Erinâs iPhone made a noise, at one point, and Paul, who had wrapped himself in a thick blanket, asked if it was Calvin.

âNo, Beau,â said Erin.

âNobo?â said Paul grinning.

âBeau. He said âmons pubis.â Ew.â

âWhat does that mean?â

âItâs a part of the body,â said Erin with a worried expression.

âYou guys are seeing . . . you guys are together again?â

âNo, weâre not,â said Erin shaking her head. âThis is, like, unacceptable behavior.â

âYouâre not together?â

âWe were . . . but then I broke up with him . . . again.â

âAgain? After we ate steak on your birthday?â

âYeah,â said Erin.

âSo . . . you got back together after that?â

âWell, no, but . . . he told me he was unemployed, and all this bad stuff was happening to him, and I felt bad.â

Paul made a quiet, ambiguous noise.

âWeâve, like, hung out,â said Erin.

âOh,â said Paul, unsure if he was confused.

âBut weâre not together,â said Erin quietly, then drank a shot of tequila and most of a Four Loko (for a video sheâd told someone she would post on her Tumblr) and an hour later, Paul saw after being in the bathroom a few minutes, was asleep with her mouth slightly open and her MacBook open on her stomach. After untangling a cord, then moving the MacBook to the floor, Paul lay beside Erin and meekly pawed her forearm three times, then briefly held some of her fingers, which were surprisingly warm. He lay stomach-down with his arm on her arm, thinking that if she woke, while he was asleep, this contact could be viewed as accidental. Maybe she would roll toward him, resting her arm across his backâtheyâd both be stomach-down, as if skydivingâin an unconscious or dream-integrated manner she wouldnât remember, in the morning, when theyâd wake in a kind of embrace and begin kissing, neither knowing who initiated, therefore brought together naturally, like plants that join at their roots. After a few motionless minutes, unable to sleep in his increasingly tense position, he rolled over and gathered a blanket into a cushiony bunch, which he held like a stuffed animal of a brain, and slept facing a wall.



The next afternoon, at the University of Baltimore, in a lounge area, bright and warm from sunlight through glass panels, Paul and Erin sat on padded chairs and watched last nightâs footage, which they felt was âunseemlyâ and decided not to edit into a video to put on YouTube. At a soup-and-sandwich restaurant, two blocks away, they discussed what movies they wanted to makeâ



Heroin, in which they inject heroin in each other and âwork on thingsâ on their MacBooks, recording six perspectives: their faces, their MacBook screens, their positions in the lounge area (from cameras on tripods in the distance) in sunlight on separate padded seats.



Cocaine, in which a third person records them going to nightclubs and bars on a Friday night in Manhattan without a plan except that they must snort cocaine every ten minutes and will carry knapsacks filled with energy drinks and fried chicken.



Or Something, in which âor somethingâ is said hundreds of times, in a montage, sometimes with context, to convey a range of meanings: a grinning Erin âluxuriatingâ in her lack of specificity, a zombie-like Paul âtiredâ of his commitment in specifying uncertainty, Erin saying âor something, or something,â earnestly to a Paul who has become âtolerantâ to âor something.â



âthen returned to the lounge area and worked on things separately, until night, when they began texting people and asking on Facebook if anyone within fifty miles wanted to sell them drugs. Someone would walk to Erinâs car to sell her cocaine and heroin, said Beau in a text, if she parked in a specific area of a shopping plaza.

âThatâs like . . . I donât know,â said Paul quietly while trying to think about why Erin had texted Beau. Erin was quiet, then said she didnât want to try that option, then they walked four blocks to her apartment, where they used Xanax and Hydrocodone before driving to an apartment where someone had LSD, which they used with a little cough syrup. They drove to a movie theater and watched Jackass 3D, then couldnât find an open restaurant, so decided to drive to New York City. They arrived around 8:30 a.m., to an afternoon-like morning, not hungry or tired, due to Adderall.

They decided to film MDMA without a plan, except to use MDMA and go canoeing in Central Park. After showering in Paulâs apartment, then riding the L train to Union Square and using MDMA in Whole Foods, then getting off an uptown 6 train four stops early by accident, they decided to go to Times Square instead of Central Park. They rode the Ferris wheel inside Toys âRâ Us, then discovered that on MDMA they could easily speak in an unspecific, aggregate parody of (1) the stereotypical âintellectualâ (2) most people in movies (3) most people on TV with a focus on newscasters and National Geographicâstyle voice-overs. They termed this manner of speaking (almost the opposite, especially for Paul, of the quiet and literal and inflectionless voice they normally used to speak to each other) âthe voice,â using it, in Barnes & Noble, with high levels of amusement and stimulation, to feign egregious ignorance, improvise seemingly expert commentary on specific objects, excessively employ academic terms and literary references.



That night, at Pure Food and Wine, an organic raw vegan restaurant near Union Square, seated outside the entrance in a kind of waiting area, they each ate a psilocybin chocolate with their salads. Their plan was to attend an Asian American Writersâ Workshop fund-raiser in an art gallery, after eating, to record part one of Mushrooms. Exiting the restaurant, a woman looked down at Erinâs MacBook with an affectedly bemused expression and asked with a French accent if it was recording.

âYes,â said Erin smiling.

âYou are recording yourself?â

âYeah,â said Erin grinning.

âThat is weird, no?â said the woman, and walked away.

âI feel like I hate everyone,â said Paul a few minutes later, walking toward the art gallery.

âHuh?â said Erin. If she didnât hear something, Paul had noticed, she would sometimes appear confused in a frightened, child-like way, as if having assumed sheâd been insulted.

âI feel like I hate everyone,â said Paul.

âYeah,â said Erin, and smiled at him.

âReally?â said Paul, a little surprised.

âYeah. Well, everyone on the street.â

âI feel like I canât even look at anyone,â said Paul.



They were on their sides facing each other on Paulâs mattress, in his room, dark except for moonlight, around 3:30 a.m. After the fund-raiser, at which a saxophone player had ranted about identity politics until people, after maybe six minutes, actually began booing, theyâd walked aimlessly into a gallery across the street, then had eaten dinner, four blocks from Paulâs apartment, at Mesa CoyoacÃ¡n. Paul scooted toward Erin, and they hugged five to ten seconds and began kissing and removing their clothes. Erinâs eyes, whenever Paul looked, seemed to be tightly closed, which seemed like ânot a good sign,â as heâd read on her blogâor somewhereâthat she liked sex with âa lot of eye contact.â They were sweating, and their heads were on the opposite side of the mattress from before, when they finished, after around fifty minutes.

That night, in the library, Paul texted Erin, whoâd left for Baltimore at 7:40 a.m. for a 12:30 p.m. public-speaking class, asking if she wanted to attend an eventâCaked Up!âin two days in an art gallery, where cakes made by graphic designers, including Paulâs brother, would be served buffet style. Paul texted it might not be worth the drive, since they would be driving eight hours the day after to Ohio, where Calvin had organized a reading and they would be staying three nights. When Erin promptly responded yes and that it wouldnât be inconvenient, because she liked driving, Paul was surprised how relieved he feltâhow disappointed he wouldâve been if she had declinedâand realized, with excitement and a concurrent adjustment of his default mood to âeager and patient,â that he was (or that he now, after Erinâs response, viewed himself as being) in a stable situation of mutual, increasing attraction.



Their last night in Ohio, around midnight, when Calvinâs parents and three brothers and Calvin were asleep, Paul and Erin decided to drink coffee and share a 30mg Adderall and each eat a psilocybin chocolate and, in the five hours before Erin would drive Paul to the airportâCalvin had bought Paul a plane ticket a month ago, as incentive to comeâfilm part two of Mushrooms in the mansionâs basement, which included a room with guitars and amps and a drum set, a game room with four arcade machines, a one-room gym, a billiards table, a home theater, a kitchen. They kissed for twenty minutes in the gym, then shut themselves in a room with two desktop computers and had sex for an hour in the dark, then showered together. They sat on a one-seat sofa in the living room with Erinâs MacBook on their lap. Paul asked if Erin wanted to go with him next week to North Carolina and Louisiana, where he had readings at colleges.

âYeah,â said Erin.

âAre you sure?â

âYeah,â said Erin.

âYouâve said yes to other things you didnât want to do.â

âCan you give me an example of one of those things?â

âSmoking weed with Calvin,â said Paul about two nights ago, and extended a finger, then another finger. âInviting Patrick to visit you,â he said about someone Erin met at the College of Coastal Georgia and had spoken to twice on Skype and exchanged mix CDs and who, by Erinâs invitation, had purchased plane tickets to visit herâfor six days, in two weeksâbut whose Facebook messages Erin had been ignoring. Paul closed his eyes and thought about how Erin seemed like she didnât want to talk to Beau anymore, but continued texting him and answering his calls.

âJust those two things,â said Paul, and opened his eyes.

âI can explain those two things. Smoking weed with Calvin, I thought it could be a thing that I want to do, but in the moment I didnât feel like doing. And Patrick . . . I felt, like, bored for a long time . . . with romantic prospects. It seemed exciting that this person in Georgia was interested in me. I thought âthis could at least be something to do.â So . . . thatâs why. And I thought that maybe once he came it could be fun, or something.â

âSo, if itâs just something to do, youâll still do it.â

âYeah,â said Erin with the word extended. âBut thatâs not what it would be like . . . with you. This,â she said, and placed a hand on Paulâs shoulder. âInterests me. A lot.â

âBut do I interest you enough for you to go through with it,â mumbled Paul.

âWith what?â said Erin after a few seconds.

âTo go through with it,â said Paul, unsure what he was referencing.

âWhat? What does?â

âI donât know,â said Paul quickly. âNever mind. You want to come.â

âI want to come.â

âOkay,â said Paul. âGood.â They saw in Google Calendar that Erin was scheduled to work two days next week. âSo . . . youâre not going with me?â

âI want to,â said Erin.

âBut you have work.â

âIâd rather go with you than work,â said Erin noncommittally.

âThen . . . what are you going to do?â

âI think I can get someone to cover my shifts. They donât really need me there those days.â

âWhat . . . are you doing?â said Paul, and grinned. âWhat the hell are you doing?â

âIâm going with you,â said Erin grinning, and patted his shoulder. âIâm going with you.â



In North Carolina two Duke University students drove Paul and Erin from the airport, where theyâd arrived on separate flights, to a hotel, returning at night to drive them to the reading. Paul and Erin talked calmly in the dark backseat, holding half-full cups of hot tea from the hotel lobby, as a college radio station played something fuzzy and instrumental and wistful. Erin said she emailed Patrick last night, while she was in Baltimore and Paul was in Brooklyn, that she started liking someone else and was sorry if he felt bad and would help pay for his plane ticket. Paul asked if Patrick might still visit Baltimore, as a kind of vacation.

âProbably not. He was going to stay in my apartment.â

âWhat did Beau say last night?â

âHe just really wanted to hang out,â said Erin, who had mentioned in an email that she had âscreamedâ at Beau on the phone. âAnd I was like, âI donât, really. I have other things to do and you shouldnât be here.â â

âHe came over?â

âNo, he was like âfuck that, Iâm coming over now.â Or like âIâm walking there now.â I was like âthis is . . . scary,â â said Erin, and laughed.

âJesus. What did you scream at him?â

âI screamed, like, âthis is done.â And I hung up on him.â

âDid he call more after that?â

âNo. He sent me . . . a mean text, insulting me. He was like, âyouâre really great, but Iâve always thought your body sucked,â or something.â

âSeems like a non sequitur.â

âI know,â said Erin, and laughed. âIt was weird.â

âDid you respond to that?â

âNo,â said Erin. âHeâs insane.â

âDo you think youâll talk to him again?â

Erin said âprobably not.â The aquarium, sparsely forested darkness outside the car, on a street sometimes half-bracketed by shopping plazas, reminded Paul of traveling at night in Florida in his familyâs minivan. During longer drives he would lay alone, with a blanket and pillow, behind the third row of seats, beyond range of communicationânot obligated to respond, he felt, even if he heard his name. In the dark and padded space, on his back, heâd see everything outside, reflected toward him, as one imageâsquiggling, watery, elemental, synthetic, holographic, layeredâin fluid, representational reconfiguration of itself. Until 13 or 14, then sometimes habitually, he never sat in the front seat of cars, even if no one else was, except the five to ten times his brother, home a few weeks or months from college, would say âIâm not your chauffeurâ and force Paul, who would feel immature and embarrassed, to sit in front. âI email with Michelle like once every three months,â said Paul. âBut in a manner like weâre emailing every day. Like, if someone read our emails it would seem like we were emailing every day.â

âThat seems good,â said Erin smiling.

In Louisiana, two days later, Paul and Erin were in a Best Buy, early in the afternoon, to buy an external hard drive, because their MacBooks from storing their movies were almost out of memory. Paul was walking aimlessly through the store with a bored expression, holding the Smashing Pumpkinsâ double CD below him, at waist level, where he scratched its plastic wrapping in an idle, distracted, privately frustrated manner. After finally tearing it off and lodging it, with difficulty, because it kept clinging to him by static electricity, behind some Beck CDs, he used âbrute force,â he thought instructionally, to pry open the locked case and get only the blue CD, which had âTonight, Tonightâ and âZeroâ on it, to listen to in the rental car.

In Best Buyâs security room, which was module-like and dimmer than the store, the sheriff of Baton Rouge shook his head in strong, earnest, remarkably unjaded disappointment when Paul, asked why he was hereâhe had a Florida driverâs license, a New York addressâsaid a college had invited him to speak to them, as an author.

âI felt ashamed,â said Paul in the parking lot to Erin. âI feel like I was on shoplifting autopilot. I wasnât thinking anything. I was just already doing it.â In Barnes & Noble, a few hours later, he stole Nirvanaâs second âgreatest hitsâ collection. They ate watermelon and pineapple chunks in Whole Foods, then drove downtown and rode an elevator to the sixth floor of a darkly tinted building, where Paul read to LSUâs graduate writing program for around twenty minutes (âfrom a memoir-in-progress thatâll be more than a thousand pages,â he said half earnestly) about a night he watched Robin Hood with Daniel at the Union Square theater, then went to a pizza restaurant, where Fran, who had whiskey in a Dr Pepper bottle, got drunker than Paul had ever seen her and the next day quit her job, after two days, as a waitress in a Polish restaurant. Paul felt self-conscious whenever mentioning a drug, in part because none of his previous books had drugsâexcept caffeine, alcohol, Tylenol Cold, St. Johnâs wortâbut the audience laughed almost every time a drug was mentioned, seeming delighted, like most of them were on drugs, which was probably true, Paul thought while reading off his MacBook screen. He imagined stopping what he was reading to instead say âKlonopin,â wait three seconds, say âXanax,â wait three seconds, etc. He didnât notice until the word âconcealmentâ that he was reading a sentence from something else heâd been working on that had been pasted apparently into the wrong file. He continued reading the sentenceâ

The transparency and total effort, with none spent on explanation or concealment or experimentation, of what the universe desiredâto hug itself as carefully, as violently and patiently, as had been exactly decided upon, at some point, with gravityâwas [something].

âuntil getting to â[something],â which he remembered using as a placeholder after trying combinations of synonyms for âaffectingâ and âconfusingâ and longer descriptions like âan actualized ideal, inside of which any combination of parts could never independently attain.â He stared at â[something]â and thought about saying âKlonopinâ or âXanax.â He thought about explaining the bracket usage. âThe sentence I just read wasnât supposed to be there,â he said. âI pasted it there by accident, I think. Iâll stop here, thank you.â

He sat next to Erin in the front row, then Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, a woman in her 60s, whose introduction included that she was married to Richard Tuttleâthe artist Gabby said Daniel resembledâread poems for thirty minutes.

At a flea market, the next afternoon, after drinking the equivalent of six to eight cups of coffeeâin the form of 24x condensed coffee, which they bought from Whole Foods and had never seen before, in containers reminiscent of toilet-cleaning liquidâthey pretended to be Wall Street Journal reporters and recorded themselves interviewing strangers about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Erin meekly asked a large, young, thuggish-looking man and his smaller friend, both wearing backward caps, if they thought Darth Vader would âdie in this one.â After a long pause the large man laughed and said âman, I donât know,â and looked at his friend, who appeared expressionless, like he hadnât heard anything that had been said.

âDarth Vader is Star Trek, not Harry Potter,â said Paul in a weak form of the âthe voice,â feigning he was remembering this aloud.

âNo, no,â said Erin grinning. âReally?â

âStar Wars,â said Paul laughing a little.

âOh, I donât know, never mind, never mind, I need to check my notes,â said Erin shaking her head and grinning as she and Paul walked away mumbling to each other, attempting to parody, Paul felt, a stereotypical comedy in which two high-level professionals are egregiously demoted into positions where they struggle to regain their jobs while nurturing between them an unlikely romance and mutually learning the true meaning in life. Erin said she felt âa strong need to be on more drugs.â Without MDMA it was difficult to use âthe voice,â without which they felt uncomfortable talking to strangers, improvising, feigning behavior, trying to be witty.

After ingesting their remaining Xanax, and more condensed coffee, they decided to drive to New Orleans, an hour away, because their flight to New York, from Baton Rouge, wasnât until the next morning. It became dark suddenly, it seemed, during the drive. Erin expressed concern about Paulâs driving speed in residential-seeming areas. Paul encouraged her to nap (theyâd both said they were sleepy, due to Xanax) and said he would be careful and, a vague amount of time later, became aware of a car that was parked, for some reason, on the street. After a few seconds of vague, unexamined confusion Paul realized the car, in the near distance, was stopped at a red light and abruptly braked hard, then harder, curling his toes with a sensation of clenching a fist. The screeching noise and forward thrust startled Erin awake, but she remained silent, seeming mostly confused. Paul drove sheep-ishly into a shopping plaza and parked near the middle of the mostly empty parking lot and turned off the car.

âI started feeling anxious before like where were we going and we were going fast and it was dark and you were running into things a little bit and I was scared and anxious and afraid,â said Erin in one breath of wildly fluctuating volume and inflection and affect that seemed out of control and arbitrary, then in retrospect like sheâd virtuosically sung a popular melody faster than anyone had ever considered trying.

âSorry,â said Paul with a worried expression.

âAnd I felt scared,â said Erin with a slight tremble.

âSorry,â said Paul. âIâm really sorry.â After he apologized more times they walked holding hands across the parking lot. Erin said she only felt slightly interrupted when she woke, that she had been like, âwait, I donât care, right now, about dying, but in the future I might not want to die.â In a confused, intrigued voice Paul said âin . . . the future?â

âIn the future Iâllââ said Erin.

âBut if youâre dead youâll be dead,â said Paul in a loud, murmurred, strangely incredulous voice that he felt aversion toward and confused by.

âWhat?â

âBut if youâre dead youâll die,â mumbled Paul in a quieter, slurred voice like a stroke victim.

âBut I didnât really want to die right then,â said Erin.



Around midnight, on the drive back to Baton Rouge, Erin said her father seemed to enjoy giving her Xanax and Adderall and that she used to get angry at him for smoking marijuana every night because it affected his memory and he would repeat himselfâand, if stopped, would become defensive, argumentativeâbut now she didnât try to change him anymore. Paul said his fatherâs default name for him, what heâd unconsciously say to get Paulâs attention or to reference Paul in conversation, was âbabyâ until high school, or maybe college, when it became âold babyââin Taiwanese, where both words were one syllableâwhich was what he now called almost all people and animals, including Dudu, the toy poodle, Paul remembered, that his parents had bought sometime in the past year, after he visited in December.

Paul talked about the panicked-seeming, alienating emails his mother had sent him the past five months, beginning in Juneâwhen he had published nonfiction on the internet mentioning cocaine and Adderallâand increasing during his book tour, when more information connecting him and drugs (tweets soliciting drugs, a âcontestâ on his blog to discern from the livestreamed video what drug he was on during his San Francisco reading, the interview with Alethia on MDMA) got on the internet. The emails had seemed complicatedly, strategically composed (referencing movies, news articles, celebrities whoâve âruined their lives,â etc.) to instill mostly fear and shame and a little guilt to reduce Paulâs drug use, for the exclusive benefit, Paul believed his mother believed, of Paulâs long-term happiness, which however Paul had repeatedly defined as âfreedomâ to do what he wanted and âtrust,â from his friends and family, that he was doing what, based on everything he knew, would result in the happiest results for everyone involved, which was what she also wanted, heâd told her many times. Paul had stated ultimatums like âif you mention drugs one more time Iâm not responding to your emails for the rest of the month,â which his mother had repeatedly agreed on and went against, saying she felt an obligationâthat it was her dutyâas a parent, to continue stating her disapproval. To an increasingly frustrated and, he sometimes suspected of himself, paranoid and distrustful Paul, the emails had begun, at some point, to tactically operate on, at the least, a base of reverse-reverse psychology, which was a cause of despair for Paul, who throughout had tried to stressâbut seemed to have failed to convincingly conveyâthat their relationship would only worsen if they couldnât communicate directly, without strategy or hyperbole or deception, while aware of himself often not communicating directly.

The emails during the book tour culminated maybe with a series of emails sent after Paul and Erin posted their âevent coverageâ of Caked Up! Theyâd pretended to be from jezebel.com and an uninhibited Paul, on MDMA, had loudly shouted at strangers, at one point, at a volume and with an amount of belligerence that was normal for most people but, for him, was done, heâd felt, for comic effect. Paulâs mother had emailed saying that the Paul in the video was not the Paul she knew and loved and that she was scared and, seeing what Paul âhad turned into,â had cried. Paul stopped responding to her emails, at that point, and, at the moment, in the car with Erin, couldnât remember offhand what heâd last said to herâeither that he wasnât responding to her emails until January, wasnât responding to any emails mentioning drugs, or wasnât responding until he believed she had internalized that their relationship would only deteriorate, causing them both to feel worse about everything and probably increase his drug use, if she continued mentioning drugs with intent to influence instead of learn or discuss, as friends, by asking questions. Paul vaguely remembered two or three emails asking when he was coming to Taiwan this year; heâd responded he didnât want to due to all the emails and broken promises. Paul believed he was doing what was best for them both and that his mother believed she was doing what was best for only Paul and not herself. Paul didnât want his mother to believe she had failed, as a parent, which he thought she must, on some level, if she was trying to change what she had created and raised, though maybe she was only focused on the task, not on her feelings.



Paul and Erin were walking near Bobst Library, a week and a half later, on a significantly colder night, in a sleet-like drizzle, when one of them said they wished it were warm and the other said they should fly somewhere warm. Las Vegas was the first suggestion. Paul said he wanted to lose all his moneyâaround $1,200âwhile âpeaking on MDMAâ after eating at a buffet and relaxing in a hot tub.

In Think Coffee, an hour later, using Erinâs MacBook, they bought a package deal for two round-trip flights and a rental car and four nights at the Tropicana, leaving on November 26, in five days.

âThis is what the universe created, after whatever billion years,â said Paul gesturing at MGM Grand and Excalibur and Luxor, around 9:30 p.m., on a walkway above the main street of casinos in Las Vegas, which was as cold or colder than New York City, theyâd learned, with some amusement, upon arriving four hours ago.

âThis is what we came into,â said Erin.

âLook, beautiful,â said Paul earnestly about the hundreds of red lights on the backs of cars, passing beneath the walk-way, into the distance, like rubies in a mining operation.

âWhoa. Pretty.â

âLife sometimes offers beautiful images,â said Paul in a voice like he was in fifth grade reading a textbook aloud.

âBut theyâre fleeting.â

âYeah,â said Paul grinning.

âAnd you canât do anything with themââ

âYeah,â said Paul.

ââexcept look at them,â said Erin.

âMaybe we should get drunk,â said Paul, and they entered the casino at the end of the walkway, and Erin went to the bathroom. Paul sat at a slot machine and lost $20, then stared at two middle-aged men wearing backward caps, holding full glasses of golden beer, as they approached and passed with determined, unhappy expressions. When Erin returned, a few minutes later, she said âI think I feel depleted.â

âWhat do you mean?â

âI feel kind of tired, depleted.â

âBut you shouldnât even have started feeling it yet.â

âHuh?â said Erin. âWe had MDMA like twenty minutes ago.â

Erin laughed. âI forgot.â

âJesus. You scared me.â

âSorry,â said Erin grinning, and they sat on the floor of a carpeted hallwayâdarkly lit from an unseen source that cyclically pulsed from a near-ultraviolet purple to dark redâpositioning Erinâs MacBook to record themselves talking about their relationship.

âYou go,â said Paul smiling widely. âYou go first.â

âOkay, um, well I felt like I first wanted to kiss you when I dropped you off at the airport,â said Erin quickly, with a stricken expression, as if confessing something intensely shameful.

âAt the airport? After Dennyâs?â

âYeah,â said Erin. âI wanted to kiss you then.â

âI thought you were hugging me really hard.â

âUh, I thought you were hugging me hard,â said Erin seeming frightened, then for around five seconds didnât breathe. Paul laughed, in confusion. Erin said she felt a little nervous. Paul asked if she thought they were going to have sex, when they kissed, on his bed. Erin said no, that she just kept thinking things like âwhatâs happening?â and âare we really going to do it?â Paul said he thought yes, because they wouldnât have been able to stop, except by finishing, because neither of them had said no to anything yet.

âWe still havenât,â said Paul. âRight?â

âUm,â said Erin. âYeah, I think.â

âThere was a period of like three days when I was really obsessed with you. But you werenât responding to my email and I kind of lost the obsessive nature.â

âWhoa,â said Erin. âWhen?â

âAfter one of the first times we hung out. We were sending picture messages, then you stopped and didnât email and I felt really depressed.â

âDamn. Sorry. I didnât know.â

âWhat was going on then?â

âI was kind of seeing Beau still then,â said Erin, and as the MDMA took effect Paul began using âthe voiceâ sometimes, including when Erin asked him which of his previous girlfriends he felt closest to and he said âIâm not really sureâ in an extreme parody of a stereotypical romantic comedy, and they laughed for maybe ten seconds. Paul had stopped using âthe voice,â an hour later, when, during a silence, Erin asked what he was thinking and he said he was thinking why she hadnât read or mentioned the first-person account of his life from April to July he had emailed her a few weeks ago, at her request, which had, to some degree, been obligatory, he knew. Erin said she felt strange reading about Paulâs romantic interest in other people while she was beginning a relationship with him. âLike, I felt jealous,â she said. âOf the Laura person, reading about her.â

âThat makes sense,â said Paul earnestly.

âI also felt a little strange reading about your friendship with Daniel. I was like âwhoa, they could hang out a lot, then just not anymore; damn, what if that happens with me?â â

âDaniel was really interested in how Kyle and I just stopped talking,â said Paul.

âThen you and Daniel stopped talking.â

âYou donât feel fine with that?â

âI do . . . I feel fine with that. I just think of all possible situations going into something . . . positive or negative. Does that make sense?â

âYeah,â said Paul nodding. âWhen I first met Michelle I was telling her that Iâve had a lot of friends who Iâve just stopped talking to, and she said she was afraid I would do that to her.â

âThat seems to be what happens with people.â

âYou donât have to read it at all,â said Paul.

âOkay,â said Erin.

âI trust whatever reasons you have . . . for doing anything,â said Paul, and wondered if he had felt this before, or if he already no longer felt it.



The next night, after buying watermelon and salad ingredients from Whole Foods, they couldnât find a parking spot at the Tropicana, then found one in a different area and walked a different route toward their room. Paul noticed a MARRIAGE CHAPEL sign at the end of the hallway and, after a few seconds, as they approached it silently, said âwe should get married.â

âI was going to say that,â said Erin.

âI would get married to you.â

âMe too,â said Erin. âTo you.â

âLetâs get married.â

âLetâs do it tomorrow.â

âOkay,â said Paul. âIâm confirmed.â



In Whole Foods, the next afternoon, Erin emailed her manager at the used bookstore that she was quitting her job, then scrolled through photos of Elvis standing between grinning, newlywed couples. Elvis appeared more energetic and alive than the couples in almost every photo, including one in which the couple was partially blocked from view by an over-eager Elvis who seemed to have lunged toward the camera, displaying the knuckles side of a peace sign.

âI donât get it, at all,â said Paul.

âItâs what people do. This is what people want.â

âIt really seems insane,â said Paul.

âPeople are insane,â said Erin.

âWe should get an Elvis wedding.â

âIâm fine with an Elvis wedding.â

âActually, I donât want an Elvis wedding,â said Paul. âIt seems extremely stressful.â Erin made a next-day reservation for a âdesk wedding.â They discussed if they wanted to be on MDMA during their marriage ceremony. Erin said they should save it for the day after tomorrow, their last in Las Vegas.

âWe might be dead by then,â said Paul.

âThey wonât let us get married if weâre on drugs,â said Erin.

âTheyâll think weâre on drugs if weâre not on drugs. Weâre normal when weâre on drugs.â

Erin laughed weakly.

âWeâll justââ said Paul. âWeâll figure it out.â

âWeâre going to be driving after the wedding, letâs just do it after we drive,â said Erin a few minutes later in a slightly pleading tone.

âOkay, okay,â said Paul earnestly while nodding and patting her shoulder, then hugged her briefly.



Across the street from the marriage license office was a billboard that said MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE about used cars and used car parts. In the office, which was bright and quiet and arranged like a post office, while filling out forms, Paul said getting married was like getting a tattoo, in that he just wanted to pay money and receive a service, not make appointments and go places and talk to strangers and be asked to confirm his choice. Erin said she was thinking that also and had been âhaving the same feelingâ as before she got tattoos. Paul noticed a sign that said intoxicated applicants would be TURNED AWAY and focused, as they approached the window, on appearing normal, but realized he didnât know how.

âLook at the helpers,â he said pointing at six to ten clips, each clasping an impressive seeming amount of paper, magnetized to the side of a cabinet. âI want one.â

âMe too,â said Erin grinning. âWhich one do you want?â

âAny of them,â said Paul after a few seconds.

âI want the curvy one,â said Erin.

Paul stared at the identical, brown clips.

âThe guy with the stripes,â said Erin. âMy own âunderling.â â

âIâm talking about the plastic paper holder things,â said Paul.

Walking to their rental car they saw a shiny building and an abandoned building side by side, in the near distance. Paul expressed amazement at this second, also obvious, though maybe less egregious metaphorâthe first being the used car billboardâand said their marriage would resemble the abandoned building in five years. After a pause, which functioned unintentionally for comic effect, he said âor, like, five days.â

Erin laughed. âFive months, maybe,â she said earnestly.

âYeah,â said Paul thinking that of the fivesâhours, days, weeks, months, years, decadesâmonths was, by far, most likely. âWeâll be that tree,â he said pointing at a tree that appeared healthy and, he thought, dignified.

âThe apartments for rent,â said Erin.

âThe tree,â said Paul.

âYeah, the tree.â

âThe tree seems good.â

âNature. Natural.â

âJesus, look,â said Paul pointing at an eerie building far in the distance, thin and black, like a cursor on the screen of a computer that had become unresponsive. He imagined building-size letters suddenly appearing, left to right, in a rushâwpkjgijfhtetiukgcnlmâacross the desert.



The marriage chapel was less than a mile away in a building containing four to six businesses. Paul sat on a two-seat sofa, in a sort of hallway, while Erin used the bathroom. Around ten people, mostly children, surrounding what appeared to be a newlywed couple, passed through Paulâs vision, on their way out of the building, then Erin sat by him, then the pastor (a large man with white hair and a serious but friendly demeanor) sat behind a tiny desk (six feet away, at the opposite wall) and read a prepared statement, completing the marriage, at which pointâcoincidentally, it seemedâa door opened and a smiling woman, with a tiny dog at her feet, congratulated Paul and Erin, after which, sort of huddled against each other, they moved toward the exit grinning.

âI immediately thought âfuck youâ to the stranger congratulating us,â said Paul outside, on a sidewalk. Erin laughed and said she thought âpop-up ad,â because âit went through the door,â and they hugged and jumped repeatedly as one mass, spinning a little and sometimes saying âwe did itâ quietly. Paul ran suddenly away, onto the parking lot, in a wide arc that curved eventually toward the rental car in a centripetal force, accelerating to a speed that was, at this point in his life, unfamiliarly fast, but not near maximum, before slowing, as he neared the passenger doorâand, knowing he would not collide with the car, briefly aware of the dream-like amount of control he had over his bodyâto a stop.



In Erinâs car, two weeks later, on the way to Brooklynâfrom Baltimore, where the past two nights he separately met Erinâs parents, who were married but lived apartâPaul texted two drug dealers, Android and Peanut, to buy MDMA, ecstasy, LSD, cocaine to have in Taiwan, where they were going in the morning. Paulâs parents had invited Paul and Erin to stay with them, as a kind of wedding present, all expenses paid including plane tickets, December 13 to January 2. The marriage, without which Paul likely would not be visiting Taiwan this year, seemed also to have drastically improved his relationship with his mother, who hadnât mentioned drugs, at all, the past three weeks, now that she had something positive to focus on and nurture.

It was dark out and neither drug dealer had responded, after two hours, when they arrived in Brooklyn and parked by Khimâs. After buying lemons, celery, kale, apples, energy drinks, toilet paper they walked six blocks to Paulâs apartment, then within ten minutes both drug dealersâand Paulâs brother, to give Paul a Christmas present and presents to bring to their parentsâtexted that they were on their way. Android, named after the smartphone, Paul assumed, arrived first. Paul went outside, past the bronze gate, into Androidâs expensive-seeming car.

âHowâs it going? You all right?â

âYeah, good. How are you?â

âIâm good,â said Android.

âHereâs $230,â said Paul, and Android transferred a vial of cocaine and a tiny baggie of capsules into Paulâs left hand. Paul asked if the MDMA was from the same batch as last time. Android said they were and, after a pause, in a voice subtly indicating auspiciousness due to rarity and increased quality, added that they were âdouble-dipped.â Paul visualized a stock image, composite from movies heâd seen, of ethnic workers apportioning powder into capsules. âOh, good,â he said, and hesitated, then asked what âdouble-dippedâ meant. Android, in response, seemed to shutdown, as a person, into a dormant state; when, after maybe two seconds, he returned to functioning, he seemed uncharacteristically bored and inattentive, like he wanted to be alone. âThey do it twice . . . it goes through once, and they dip it again,â he said unenthusiastically, with unfocused eyes and a subtle movement of his upper body that somehow effectively conveyed an additional, unrequired action within the process of an assembly line.

âNice,â said Paul. âThank you for driving here.â

âNo problem,â said Android in his normal voice. âGive me a call if you want some stuff over the holidays.â

âWe did it,â said Paul in a monotone to Erin in his room, and they hugged. Peanut texted he was ten minutes away. Paul read a text from his brother and went outside and opened the bronze gate. Paulâs brother followed Paul into the house, where Erin stood in the hallway outside Paulâs apartment.

âErin, right? Nice to finally meet you.â

âNice to meet you too,â said Erin.

After a pause, during which they all grinned at one another, Paulâs brother gave Paul a duffel bag and a check and, due to pressure from their mother, Paul assumed, a winter coat, and said âthis is for Mom and Dad, you have to remember to give it to them,â indicating a department store bag inside the duffel bag.

âOkay,â said Paul looking in the duffel bag.

âYou have to remember.â

âI will,â said Paul.

âYou canât forget. Okay?â

âI wonât,â said Paul.

âOkay,â said Paulâs brother in a slightly child-like voice, then looked at a vacantly grinning Erin and hastily said âweâll have a formal dinner later on together, all of us,â with a scrunched expression conveying he knew that she obviously already knew this information, which he was saying aloud as a kind of indulgence to himself. Peanut texted five minutes later when Paul was sitting on his yoga mat, absently organizing his drugs in his six-compartment plastic container.

Paul got in the backseat of a car that, relative to Androidâs, did not seem expensive. The same middle-aged woman as the previous four or five times Paul bought from Peanut, the past few months, was driving. Paul distractedly imagined himself asking if the woman was Peanutâs mother as he bought two strips of LSD and thirty ecstasyâhalf blue, half redâfrom Peanut, who was in the front passenger seat.



Paul and Erin, sitting on Paulâs mattress, were wearing earphones and doing things on their MacBooks, an hour later, after each ingesting âdouble-dippedâ capsules of MDMA and 10mg Adderall and sharing a zero-calorie energy drink. Theyâd decided to use drugs throughout the night and sleep on the plane. Paul, worried because he didnât feel like talking even after the MDMA and Adderall shouldâve taken effect, inspected the capsules and asked Erin on Gmail chat if they seemed less full than in the past; they didnât, to her, but she also wasnât feeling a strong effect. They concluded the problem was their tolerance levels and each ingested a blue ecstasy and continued doing things separately. âI feel something now, but Iâm not sure if I feel like talking,â thought Paul looking at his Gmail account. âBut I think Iâll be okay.â

The next four hours they had sex (and showered) three times, shared 50oz kale-celery-apple-lemon juice and 30mg Adderall, typed accounts of a cold and sunny afternoon one week ago when they walked around SoHo on MDMA shouting and screaming iterations of Charlesâ name (initials, first, first and last, full) at each other while holding hands. Paul packaged a strip of LSD, four MDMA, twelve ecstasy inside the CD case for Nirvanaâs second âgreatest hitsâ album, which he wrapped in transparent tape, then in four issues of Seattleâs leading alt weekly with his face on the cover, which his mother had requested he bring, then in a shirt, which he fit snugly inside a shoebox.

Around 4:30 a.m., after deciding to use all their cocaine before leaving for the airport, they recorded Erin licking cocaine off Paulâs testicles and serving cocaine off an iPhone to Paul reading a purple-covered Siddhartha while seated on a high chair he found on a sidewalk in August and until now had used only as a clothing rack; Erin snorting cocaine off her MacBook screen; Paul snorting cocaine off Erinâs face; both snorting cocaine off vacuum-wrapped Omaha Steaks, which Calvinâs father had ordered for Paul for Thanksgiving. They discussed, relative to Adderall, not liking cocaine, which was inferior in price, effect, length of effect, after effect, convenience, availability but fun to have in group situations, in terms of thinking of funny places to snort it from. Paul said he wanted to shower before finishing the cocaine and walking to Variety, a cafÃ© four blocks away, to relax, drink iced coffee, wait for their airport taxi.

After showering Paul dried himself and put on clothes and, while Erin was showering, stood in a corner and stared at his room without thinking anything or, he realized after a vague amount of time, moving his eyeballs. He sat on his yoga mat and stared at his Gmail account, remembering after a few minutes that heâd wanted to stand in a corner and look at his room to double-check heâd packed everything. When Erin, looking at herself in the wall mirror, finished blow-drying her hair, around fifteen minutes later, Paul looked up from where heâd remained on his yoga matâabsently scrolling through bohemianismâs Wikipedia page after clicking âbohemianâ on Kurt Cobainâs page, which heâd looked at, while rereading emails from his mother, to see if he died at 26 or 27âand asked if Erin was âready,â with what felt like a self-consciously neutral expression, vaguely sensing his question to be antagonistic, because he didnât know exactly what it referenced.

âYeah,â said Erin with a blank expression.

âNo,â said Paul pointing at her MacBook and small pile of miscellany by her red backpack, which he felt aversion toward, in a manner that would become a problem, for him, in the future, he realized, with aversion toward himself, because it always seemed dirty.

âWhat,â said Erin.

âYouâre not finished packing.â

âI thought we were doing that first?â said Erin pointing at the cocaine.

Paul felt himself blinking. âOh,â he said. âYeah. I forgot. Sorry.â He stood and stepped carefully over his yoga mat and kneeled by the low table and asked with unfocused eyes and a controlled voice if Erin wanted to use the remaining cocaine at Varietyâto extend their usage and, he vaguely thought, soften their forthcoming âdepletion,â or âdepleted serotonin levels,â as they had, with a kind of feigned affection, been referencing their periods, after feeling good on drugs, of feeling bad.

âOkay,â said Erin after a pause. âBut we should cut it first.â

âWe can do it there,â said Paul after a long pause.

âItâll be easier to do it here,â said Erin.

Paul stared at her tired, confident expression.

âI donât want to do it there,â she said.

âOkay. But weâll have to put it back in, after taking it out, if we do it here. We have to take it out and put it all back in again.â

âThatâs fine. We arenât in a hurry . . . are we?â

âNo,â said Paul after a few seconds, and heard himself thinking, in a voice like he was practicing a speech, that an amount, even if only a trace, of cocaine would remain outside the vialâand it would all just clump together again, when back inside. There was also the risk of sneezing or otherwise uncontrollably disrupting the cocaine. âBut weâll lose some, when you take it out,â he said slowly. âIt just . . . seems inconvenient.â Erin said she could âcut it really fastâ and that sheâd done it many times, arguably referencing, for the second or third time, a somewhat mysterious period of her life, when she did cocaine with Beau and other people every night or something. Paul felt aversion toward himself for feeling bothered by how Erin, or the situation itself, seemed to be indicating that, by not defaulting to Erinâs greater experience in cutting cocaine, Paul was behaving irrationally. âIt just seems inconvenient,â he was saying. âItâs just inconvenient.â

âWe can cut it there,â said Erin with a bored expression. âIt doesnât really matter.â

âWeâll just cut it here,â said Paul, and slowly swiveled his head toward the cocaine. He grasped the cute, orange-capped vial with the thumb and middle finger of his right hand, whose full weight rested on the table. âI donât care about cutting it. When we put it back in, wonât it, just, like, turn into a clump again?â

âWe donât have to,â said Erin. âI donât really care.â

âWhy cut it, though? Doesnât it all just go in you?â

âIt doesnât hurt as much,â said Erin, and gestured at the top half of her face and said things about sinuses, that it was âhealthierâ and that âmore of it gets absorbed, instead of going in your stomach,â as Paul thought about referencing Cocaine: A Drug and Its Social Evolution, a book he knew Erin knew heâd been reading. âIt all gets absorbed,â he said. âItâs the same if you eat it or snort it.â

âThen why does everyone snort it,â said Erin seeming neither curious nor rhetorical.

âPeople do a lot of things. I donât know why, probably a lot of reasons. Itâs the same as long as itâs inside of you. I read the book. The cocaine book.â

âThatâs true,â said Erin.

âSo, you should listen to me,â said Paul grinning slightly.

âThe book said itâs the same if you eat it?â

âYeah, or something,â mumbled Paul looking away. âI donât remember what it said.â

âWhat else did the book say?â

âA lot of things. I donât know. I havenât finished it yet. Iâm going to pee.â Paul stood grinning and went in the bathroom and peed a little. He splashed water onto his face. He dried his face with a hand towel and entered his room. âThat was our first âdrug fight,â â he said still grinning a little.

âI was going to say that,â said Erin.

âI feel like we handled it well.â

âIt was good,â said Erin absently.

âI tried using the book,â said Paul grinning. âThe cocaine book.â

âI noticed,â said Erin with a neutral expression.



At Variety, after snorting the remaining cocaine in Paulâs room, they decided to type accounts of their âdrug fight.â Paul finished and left for Union Square to mail drugs to Taiwan. The shoebox, on his lap, felt âlike a cat,â he kept thinking on the L train. He walked in a distended circle, like a cometâs orbit, on the wide sidewalk outside FedEx, which at 7:54 a.m. was locked and dark, listening to music through earphones, until an employee, seeming to slightly feign, Paul felt, being rushed, unlocked the door and entered and turned on the lights. Paulâs package would cost $89 to mail, said the employee, then walked out of view, toward the back of the store. Paul slowly filled out a form, then carried the form toward the exit, stood uncertainly in place a few seconds, returned to the counter, walked distractedly toward the exit, put the form in the trash, left FedEx. He rode the L train five stops. He bought two containers of pineapple chunks from a deli. âIt wouldâve cost $89 to mail,â he said at Variety. âIâm just going to put it in my bag. If I go to jail Iâll just write Infinite Witz,â he said referencing two very long novels, Infinite Jest and Witz.

âWhat?â said Erin with an inattentive expression.

âIf I go to jail Iâll just focus on writing Infinite Witz,â said Paul, and in the time and location of waiting, for himself to repeat what heâd said, he imagined the scenario and was a little surprised at the ease and speed with which he felt he would accept itâand that he would be relieved, to be removed from the confusing, omnidirectional hierarchy of his life. Erin smiled and said âgoodâ and patted his shoulder, and he felt surprised again, as he hugged her, realizing that he wouldnât be removed from his lifeâonly dying would remove himâso would feel the same probably. He would still beâand be insideâthe invulnerable dot of himself, irreducible and unique as a prime number, on or off, there or not, always following itself perfectly. Paul pushed the shoebox toward the bottom of his duffel bag, wedging it between layers of clothing, and they read each otherâs âdrug fightâ accounts while eating pineapple chunks.

âWe both wrote it in a Raymond Carverâesque manner.â

âI was thinking that,â said Erin. âThe story with the baby.â

In the taxi, at one side of the backseat, Paul felt surreally distant from Erin, at the other side, like he would need to turn his head more than 90 degrees to see her. Through the window, against his face, the early-morning light had the vertical glare and the accumulated, citrus heat of a late-afternoon sun. âI feel really depleted, Iâm closing my eyes until we get there,â said Paul in a voice that was agitatedly boring for himself to speak and hear and that seemed to echo inside his mouth, staying where it began.



At the airport, when they got out of the taxi, Erin asked how Paul felt and he murmured âzombie-likeâ without moving his head. They held hands while standing in line for luggage check-in, but Paul avoided looking at Erin, facing away from her as much as possible, to try to convey, without speaking, that he did not want to be asked any more questions, be looked at, or otherwise feel pressured to do or think anything. Unsure if Erin, at whatever moment, was receiving his communication, or not, or to what degree she was, or was not, Paul felt a constant dread of what might happen next, mostly that Erin might ask him another question. He wanted to hide by shrinking past zero, through the dot at the end of himself, to a negative size, into an otherworld, where he would find a placeâin an enormous city, too large to know itself, or some slowly developing suburbâto be alone and carefully build a life in which he might be able to begin, at some point, to think about what to do about himself.

They lay on their backs on a padded seat continuously lining one side of a cafeteria with no restaurants open yet. When Paul woke, drooling a little, he moved into a sitting position with his elbows on a table, and saw that Erin was gone. Before forming any thoughts, or discerning any feelings, he saw her, in the distance, outside the cafeteria, walking parallel to a moving walkway with her iPhone to her ear, becoming out of view. Paul noticed a scrap of paper on his lap, from Erin, saying she was going to the bathroom and calling her friend and would be back by 9:15 a.m. Paul saw her at 9:08 a.m. hurriedly enter a store outside the cafeteria. She approached with pineapple chunks and bottled water, smiling at Paulâs neutral expression. âI got you this,â she said, and Paul mutely held the container of pineapple chunks a few seconds before placing it distractedly on the table.

âWhere did you go?â said Paul self-consciously.

âI went to the bathroom and called my friend Jennika. Did you see my note?â

âI didnât until like five minutes after I woke,â said Paul with aversion toward himself, aware he saw the note within a minute maybe. He asked why Erin didnât stay within view to talk on the phone. Erin said she hadnât thought of that and Paul said it was okay andâfinally, self-conscious at the delayâthanked her for the pineapple chunks and opened the container and moved a chunk, with a fork, toward Erinâs mouth. Erin shook her head. Paul moved the chunk into his mouth and, after his mouth stopped moving, asked what Erin talked to Jennika about on the phone.

âI told her I got married and was going to Taiwan, and she got angry and just started sobbing and yelling at me,â said Erin, and without noticeable change in her slack posture, facing the empty cafeteria, began crying a little. Paul carefully held herâweakly, tiredly âhating himself,â he feltâand, after she stopped crying, asked why Jennika had been angry. âShe was angry I didnât tell her sooner. She kept saying she would never do that to me and that I was a bad friend.â

Paul continued asking questions and was slightly affected by Erinâs extrasensitivity, it seemed, in not relating unsolicited information. Erin said Jennika had previously always been okay with periods without contactâwith respecting the other personâs availabilityâand that after Jennika she had called her mother to say she felt scared that Paul didnât want her to go to Taiwan with him.

âWhy do you think that?â

âI started feeling paranoid. I felt like you didnât want me around and Iâm bothering you just by being around.â

âNo,â said Paul shaking his head.

âYouâve been so quiet,â said Erin.

âIâm quiet from being depleted. I said I felt zombie-like.â

âI know, but I still felt paranoid. I thought âwhat if heâs just tolerating me. Iâm going to be around him for the next three weeks.â And things like that.â

âWeâre depleted big-time. Donât trust what you feel now.â

âI felt all this even after factoring in depletion,â said Erin, and Paul eased her into a lying position, on her side with her head on his lap, and alternated feeding her and himself pineapple chunks.



On the fully booked, thirteen-hour twenty-nine-minute flight to Narita, where they would transfer to a three-hour fifteen-minute flight to Taiwan, they had middle seats in consecutive, three-seat rows. Before takeoff, standing in view of the four relevant passengers, Erin asked if âanyoneâ wanted to trade seats for $40 so she could sit with her husband and was egregiously ignored except by the middle-aged woman, to Paulâs left, who said âno thanksâ cheerfully, as if sheâd misconstrued the situation to believe she was doing a favor by declining. Paul sometimes stood to lean forward and hug Erinâs head, massage her shoulders, or grin at her after certain lines of dialogue during Eat, Pray, Love, which they excitedly agreed to watch together and both felt nearly continuously amused by.

After the movie they stood hugging by the âlavatories.â Erin said she felt better than when sheâd been paranoid, but seemed reluctant to reciprocate Paulâs enthusiasm when, with a child-like sensation of wanting to be encouraged to believe a fantasy, or that an aberration was the norm, he said, for the third time since getting on the plane, as if stressing the unexpected discovery of something worth living for, in an existence in which most things were endured, not enjoyed, that it seemed good they used âall those drugs and energy drinksâ and hadnât slept and still felt âokay.â Paul was surprised and confused when it occurred to him that if they felt almost anything other than happy, or at least content, Eat, Pray, Love (with its montages and fortune cookieâlike monks and unacknowledged but knowing, it had seemed, usage of clichÃ©s) wouldâve been incredibly depressing. He felt self-consciously, annoyingly optimistic when Erin reacted to this information, which had felt to him like an epiphany, with little interest and no enthusiasm, seeming less glad or curious than troubled, as if the message was to retroactively not enjoy the movie.



Before Paul visited his parents twelve months ago (which had been his first time in Taiwan in almost five years, during which most of the Taipei Metro, or Mass Rapid Transit, had been completed) he had no concept of Taipeiâs size or shape or layout, only an unreliable memory of how many minutes by car separated certain relativesâ apartments and department stores. After using the MRT and idly studying its maps on station walls and Wikipedia, then walking between stationsâto and from different routes, one night to six continuous stops, some days while far from his parentsâ apartment to illuminate a distant area, placing a candle there for perspective, or as a reminder that there was moreâhe had, with increasing interest, begun to view and internalize Taipei less like a city than its own world, which he could leisurely explore, he imagined, for years, or maybe indefinitely, as it reconfigured and continued to expand, opening new MRT stations until 2018, according to Wikipedia.

To Paul, whoâd stayed mostly in his uncleâs sixteenth-floor apartment on previous visits, the vaguely tropical, consummating murmur of Taipei, from his parentâs fourteenth-floor apartment, had sounded immediately and distinctively familiar. The muffled roar of traffic, hazily embellished with beeps and honks and motorcycle engines and the occasional, looping, Doppler-effected jingle from a commercial or political vehicleâhad been mnemonic enough (reminding Paul of the 10 to 15 percent of his life on the opposite side of Earth, with a recurring cast of characters and no school and a different language, almost fantastically unlike the other 85 to 90 percent, in suburban Florida) for him to believe, on some level, that if a place existed where he could go to scramble some initial momentum, to disable a setting implemented before birth, or disrupt the out-of-control formation of some incomprehensible worldview, and allow a kind of settling, over time, to occurâlike a spaceship that has exhausted its fuel and begun falling toward the nearest star, approaching what it wants at the rate itâs wanted, then easing into the prolonged, perfectly requited appreciation of an orbitâit would be here.

Paulâs father looked the same as last year, Paul thought at the airport, except maybe, as part of a long-term change, a little more child-like, in his mindfully cheerful manner, seeming always slightly distracted by some earnest, interior activity, which Paul sometimes imagined to be the low-level focus required to retain the mysterious, untransferable, necessarily private wisdom that powered his contentment. Paul thought of how, as one aged, more people became comparatively younger, so that, among an increasingly child-like population, one might unconsciously behave more like a child. While buying bus tickets, then waiting for the bus, Paulâs father said he had found Paulâs Taiwanese publisher on the internet and called themâlearning it was one person, in his apartmentâand arranged for Paul to give a reading for the Taiwanese edition of his first novel on Christmas, its release date.

On the bus Erin slept with her head on Paulâs lap. Paulâs father slept one row behind. It was around 10:30 p.m. Paul stared at the lighted signs, some of which were animated and repeating like GIF files, attached to almost every building to face oncoming trafficâfrom two-square rectangles like tiny wings to long strips like impressive Scrabble words but with each square a word, maybe too much information to convey to driversâand sleepily thought of how technology was no longer the source of wonderment and possibility it had been when, for example, he learned as a child at Epcot Center, Disneyâs future-themed âamusement park,â that families of three, with one or two robot dogs and one robot maid, would live in self-sustaining, underwater, glass spheres by something like 2004 or 2008. At some point, Paul vaguely realized, technology had begun for him to mostly only indicate the inevitability and vicinity of nothingness. Instead of postponing death by releasing nanobots into the bloodstream to fix things faster than they deteriorated, implanting little computers into peopleâs brains, or other methods Paul had probably read about on Wikipedia, until it became the distant, shrinking, nearly nonexistent somethingness that was currently lifeâand life, for immortal humans, became the predominate distraction that was currently deathâtechnology seemed more likely to permanently eliminate life by uncontrollably fulfilling its only function: to indiscriminately convert matter, animate or inanimate, into computerized matter, for the sole purpose, it seemed, of increased functioning, until the universe was one computer. Technology, an abstraction, undetectable in concrete reality, was accomplishing its concrete task, Paul dimly intuited while idly petting Erinâs hair, by way of an increasingly committed and multiplying workforce of humans, who receive, over hundreds of generations, a certain kind of advancement (from feet to bicycles to cars, faces to bulletin boards to the internet) in exchange for converting a sufficient amount of matter into computerized matter for computers to be able to build themselves.

As the bus moved into denser parts of Taipei, nearing Paulâs parentsâ apartment building, Paul felt like he could almost sense the computerization that was happening in this area of the universe, on Earthâcould imagine the three- or four-minute simulation, in a documentary that probably existed, of occurrence and eventual, omnidirectional expansion, converting asteroids and rays and stars, then galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as they became elapsed in space, into more of itself. Paul had read about this in high school, lying on the carpet in his room, in The End of Science, with excitement, intuiting that, from the perspective of the computer at the end of everything, which he would be a part of and which would synthetically resemble an undifferentiated oneness, it didnât matter if he had never kissed a girl, was too anxious to communicate with his peers, had no friends, etc. When Erin woke, seeming depressed and confused, avoiding looking at anything as she sat up, Paul patted his lap and she lay there again. Paul asked if she could think of a newer word for âcomputerâ than âcomputer,â which seemed outdated and, in still being used, suspicious in some way, like maybe the word itself was intelligent and had manipulated culture in its favor, perpetuating its usage.

âIâm still thinking,â she said after a few minutes.

âI donât think my question made sense,â said Paul. âThere canât be a newer word . . . for the same word.â

More framed pictures of Paul were on display in his room, it seemed, than last year. Seeing them (two as a baby, four as a small child, one as an adolescent, two as a teenager in his marching band uniform) arranged on shelves, in two corners, Paul imagined his mother placing them strategically to affect him to use less drugs. He gathered all but one (in which he was nine or ten and grinning and holding, for some reason, a Three Musketeersâstyle sword, with his parents and brother, in a professional studio in Taipei, with an outer-space-themed background, unfurled like a scroll, he vaguely remembered, on the wall, preâgreen screen) and stacked themâso many the room had felt like a memorialâfacedown on a dresser, saying they made him uncomfortable. Erin asked why and said he looked cute and happy in them. Paul said he would feel uncomfortable seeing that many of anyoneâs face.

The next afternoon, walking to a street market, Paul and Erin stopped to look at a two-story McDonaldâs with five employees outside speaking into megaphones, sometimes in unison, waving banners and flags. Paul said there were fewer McDonaldâs in Taiwan than fifteen years ago, that this was probably a âlast-ditch effort,â which seemed to be working (the first floorâthey could see through the glass frontâwas entirely filled with customers). Erin said they should improvise a documentary titled Taiwanâs Last McDonaldâs or Taiwanâs First McDonaldâs. They walked to the end of the street market and back, on the same route, buying and eating things, then bought and ate egg tarts from two different bakeries, then with nervous grins earnestly discussed eating however many egg tarts it would take for them to not want more, but resisted and returned to the apartment building, where they lay for an hour in the buildingâs sauna and dog-paddled, in a heated pool, to six different massage stations, including oneâpartly simulating a waterfall, maybeâwhere water fell eight to ten feet in pummeling, faucet-like columns onto the tops of their heads.

âMy face wonât stop being red from the thing,â said Erin, an hour later, in Paulâs room, in a voice like she was mostly thinking about something else. Paul was trying to open the taped CD case for Nirvanaâs second âgreatest hitsâ collection. He looked at Erin briefly. âIt looks good,â he mumbled looking at the CD case. His mother, in the hallway outside the room, whose door was open a few inches, said something in Mandarin.

âWhat?â said Paul in Mandarin.

âBring your phone,â said Paulâs mother in Mandarin.

âOkay.â

âWhat?â

âOkay,â said Paul in Mandarin. âDonât worry,â he said in Mandarin in a louder, agitated-sounding voice.

âOkay. Your father and I are going to eat.â

âOkay,â said Paul in Mandarin.

âDo you . . . want to come eat together?â

âNo,â said Paul in Mandarin.

âTheyâre leaving,â said Paul after a few seconds.

âOh,â said Erin in a staccato with a worried expression.

âWeâll wait till they leave.â

âOh,â said Erin.

âBefore weââ said Paul.

Erin nodded attentively.

âTheyâre going to eat,â said Paul, and walked to a bookshelf and stared at two hardbound Animal Life volumes with the same image of a cheetah climbing a tree on their spines. He opened and closed a drawer, aware he wasnât thinking anything, then put on black socks and hugged Erin from behind. They looked at themselves, being recorded, on the screenâuniquely neither reflection nor movie, but viewable perspectiveâof Paulâs MacBook, smiling sarcastically. Their plan for tonight was to ingest MDMA, after Paulâs parents left, and go to a shopping district where the streets, closed off to cars, were used as giant sidewalks. Paul showed Erin its Wikipedia page (âXimending is the source of Taiwanâs fashion, subculture, and Japanese culture) and typed âximendingâ in Google Images.

âWhoa,â said Erin. âLooks like Times Square.â

âWeâre leaving,â shouted Paulâs mother a few minutes later, when Paul and Erin were looking at the Wikipedia page for 28 Days Later, which Erin had said was one of her favorite movies. Paul was rereading a sentence (âAs he gets hit by a car in his flashback, he simultaneously dies on the operating tableâ) for the fourth time, in idle confusion, when the apartmentâs metal door closed in a loud and distinct but, Paul thought, non-ominous click.



Ten minutes later Paul was at the dining table staring at an email from Calvin (âhi bro. did you get the steaks my dad sent you? lol . . .â) while waiting for Erin, who was in the bathroom. Paul typed âhiâ and his eyes unfocused. He typed â,â and saved âhi,â as a draft. He minimized Safari and saw his face, which seemed bored and depressed, his default expression. He maximized Safari and imagined millions of windows, positioned to appear like one window. He closed his eyes and thought of the backs of his eyelids as computer screens; both could display anything imaginable, so had infinite depth, but as physical surfaces were nearly depthless. Paul typed âppl are powerful computers w 2 computer screens & free/fast/reliable access to their own internetâ in Twitter, copied it, closed Twitter, pasted it in his Gmail draft of tweet drafts. He was thinking about the fast-food restaurant Arbyâs, which heâd always felt a little confused by, when Erin appeared behind him and patted his shoulders with both hands moving up and down.

âLetâs hug as hard as we can,â said Paul, and stood and they did. âI think being squished really hard is what people who cut themselves get . . . to feel.â

âHave you cut yourself?â

âNo. Have you?â

âNo,â said Erin carrying the MacBook toward the front door.

âWhy would being squished feel good?â said Paul absently.

âHm,â said Erin. âDo you have mââ

âRaarrr!â screamed Paul with his mouth open.

âJesus,â said Erin grinning.

âDoes it smell?â said Paul about his breath.

âMaybe like coffee a little bit. But itâs okay.â

Paul jogged to the bathroom, brushed his teeth and tongue, rinsed his mouth, jogged to the front door. Erin asked if he had her âID thingââhe didâthen touched his arm and quickly said âdo you feel okay?â in a high-pitched voice. Paul, whoâd begun to feel the MDMA, looked at Erinâs hand and imagined feeling utter disbelief, increasing to uncontrollable rage, that she would touch his arm, at a time like this. âYeah,â he said with a neutral expression. âDo you?â

âYeah,â said Erin. âWait, is myââ

âSmells vaguely of barbecue, but itâs good,â said Paul, and patted her shoulder.

âVaguely of barbecue,â said Erin grinning.



In the mirror-walled elevator they stared at themselves on the screen of Paulâs MacBook, which Erin held waist level. Paul moved in a parody of a robot and lightly slapped Erin twice. Erin slapped Paul once and, after exiting the elevator, yawned audibly, as they approached an atrium of spiral staircases and a gigantic Christmas tree.

âLook,â said Paul with a fish-like expression.

Erin laughed loudly. âJesus,â she said.

âYou made a Jack Nicholson facial expression.â

âReally?â said Erin, and laughed.

âYour eyebrows went,â said Paul demonstrating.

âWhoa,â said Erin loudly. âI made a soundboard laugh.â

âOh,â said Paul. âOh,â he said quietly, and moved toward a potted plant and, before reaching it, jumped in place, slightly confused by his own behavior. Erin said she thought Paul was going to âjump on.â There was a suctioned, whooshing noise as they exited automatically opening doors onto a wide sidewalk. Paul turned leftâinto Erin, who almost dropped the MacBookâand sustained an uninhibited, yelping noise for three or four seconds, imagining himself as a butler in a Disney movie in comically prolonged recovery from almost dropping an elaborately layered tray of desserts and drinks. Paul had an urge to practice the noise repeatedly, with increasing frustration, trying to perfect itâcut-scene to him in a straitjacket.

âJesus,â said Erin grinning. âShould I get dramatic shots of the street?â

âWhatever you want.â

âDramatic ass shots,â said Erin.

âItâs your night,â said Paul in vague reference to the Cinderella archetype of a beautiful, oppressed, sympathetic character that experiences a hectic reversal of fortune. âI keep thinking âthis is our nightâ for some reason,â he said a few minutes later, and his eyes felt shiny, and he thought of shyness, acceptance. âI wonder what itâs going to be like for us, for our twenty days here,â he said as they crossed a street. âWhat are we going to . . . do?â

âWhat if we get divorced by then?â

âIt seems possible,â said Paul. âTwenty-eight days.â

âTwenty-eight days,â said Erin grinning. âTwenty-day immersion technique.â

âHave you ever spent twenty straight daysââ

âYeah,â said Erin.

âYou have?â

âWith Jennika. This summer, in Seattle.â

âI mean with a boyfriend,â said Paul, and imagined himself becoming physically faceted by rapidly facing different directions, in 15-degree movements, advancing blurrily ahead as a barely visible, wave-like curvature.

âOh. Yeah. Probably.â

âWho?â

âFirst boyfriend. Kent.â

âSleeping together?â said Paul suppressing an urge to scream it in mock disbelief. Erin said they were together âlike every dayâ in the beginning and that âit seemed okay.â Paul asked what she meant by âokayâ and visualized âit seemedâ darkening and âokayâ brightening colorfully. He mock studied âokay,â which suddenly enlarged and disappeared by âflyingâ through him, it seemed. Paul felt vaguely, uncertainly amused. Erin was explaining that she and Kent didnât fight until she used his computer to write a paper and saw a folder of naked girlfriend pictures, which Kent said were from so long ago he couldnât remember and that the girl lived in Poland and he didnât talk to her anymore, all of which were lies.

âHow do you feel about our fights so far?â

âI feel . . . they seem to be okay,â said Erin descending stairs into a powerfully air-conditioned MRT station, marbled and quiet and clean, with the austere plainness of an established museum. âI still feel the same amount of interest toward you. But I think I worry more. I worry like âhe might actually have a reaction toward this so Iâll think about it more.â Or something. How do you think about them?â

âThey seem fine,â said Paul.

âIs . . . this how it usually goes?â

âYeah,â said Paul with the word extended.

âLike the fights are similar?â

âUm, yeah . . . I donât have the kind of fight where itâs, like, âfighting,â â said Paul as they passed a bakery where he photographed and ate a crispy, red-bean-paste-filled croissant last year. âLike, yelling at each other and trying to âwin,â or something. Or, like, forgetting about it.â

âOr like what?â

âLike âwinning.â I donât have that kind of fight.â

âOh,â said Erin.

âEver,â said Paul quietly.

Erin said with Kent she had the kind of fight where it turned into âproving a point,â then escalated into yelling. Paul asked if she fought with Harris, her second boyfriend.

âNo,â said Erin.

âYou have a curling effect,â said Paul touching her hair. âI like it. Is that what youâre going for?â

âYeah,â said Erin smiling endearingly.

âYou didnât fight with the second one at all?â

âWe had fights like you and I, like discussion-style things,â said Erin. âI donât think we ever yelled at each other. Except, did we ever, noâno, we never yelled.â

âHow do you feel about me compared to your other boyfriends?â

âI like you more,â said Erin.

âThan all of them?â

âYeah,â said Erin.

âI like youââ

âYouââ said Erin.

ââmore also,â said Paul.

âReally?â

âYeah,â said Paul.

âSweet,â said Erin. âYou seem to encompass major things of what I want, in ways I feel like only segments of other people . . . have.â She patted Paulâs chest and said âI like youâ as they approached an intersection of corridors, wide as four-lane streets, where last year, leaning against a pillar in the left corridor, Paul read the last few pages of KÅbÅ Abeâs The Face of Another, which ended with the narrator, hiding behind a pillar, about to attack his âimposter.â Paul realized they were walking the wrong direction, and they turned around.

âWhat do you think your parents think about me?â

âThey . . . like you,â said Paul, and laughed quietly.

âDo they usually act like . . . the way they did?â

âYeah,â said Paul uncertainly. âI think theyâre always focused on me, not the other person. But, yeah.â

âI wondered about that.â

âMy momâs probably thinking about drugs a lot,â said Paul, and Erin laughed and hiccupped, it seemed, at the same time. Paul said âI mean worried about drugs.â

âIs she addicted? Do you think?â

âYeah,â said Paul grinning.

Erin said sheâd noticed that Paul sometimes sounded âreally angryâ when talking to his mother in Mandarin. Paul said he didnât feel angry, that he had gotten into a habit, from being a spoiled child, of talking to her like that and that it used to be âway worse.â Until he was 7 or 8 his voice, incomprehensible to anyone outside his family, had been a harmonica-like, almost electronic, squealing-bleating noise, which wholly outsourced the task of articulation, in the form of deciphering, to the listener. Paulâs brother would tell him to âstop screamingâ or âstop whining.â Paulâs mother, the listener probably 95 percent of the time, a shy and anxious person herself, probably had strongly encouraged and liked how unrestrained and unself-conscious Paul had been.

âI was surprised,â said Erin. âIâve never heard you talk like that.â

âI really donât like it,â said Paul.

âItâs interesting,â said Erin stepping onto a down escalator.

âIâm embarrassed about it.â

âI do it with my parents,â said Erin smiling.

âWhat have you read by KÅbÅ Abe?â

âJust The Woman in the Dunes.â

âWhat else do you think about me?â said Paul, and laughed sarcastically, which Erin also did, then both abruptly stopped and hugged and, stepping off the escalator, approached one of eight automated turnstiles. Paul said âjust hold it to the thingâ about Erinâs MRT card, then in a deeper voice than normal âwait, waitâ and, after a pause, that he was âgoing to poop.â



Paul could see himself, after exiting the bathroom, shakily enlarging on the screen of his MacBook, which Erin pointed at him, as he maneuvered toward it in a flighty zigzag, perpendicularly against people walking to and from turnstiles, escalators. âI just vomited, like, water,â he said.

âOh my god. Really? Are you sick?â

âNo, Iâm just getting the feeling of a lot of emptiness.â

âOh. I was going to go poop but theââ

âGo, go,â said Paul.

ââlike the thing, or, okay,â said Erin.

âWikipedia? What?â

âThe thing in the floor? I wasnât sure how to use it.â

âYou went in there?â said Paul.

âItâs just, like, a hole in the floor, interesting.â

âWhat if I couldnât find you?â

âHuh?â said Erin with a confused expression.

âWhat if I couldnât find you? You went in the bathroom?â

âI just went in for a second, with the intention ofââ

âGo, go,â said Paul patting Erinâs shoulder, and she went. Paul set his MacBook on the floor. His legs moved in and out of view for a few minutes. âHello?â he said in Mandarin into his iPhone. âOkay, okay, weâre leaving now, okay, bye.â Erin was skipping toward him and, it seemed, flapping her arms. Paul said his mother called to remind them they canât eat or drink on the train. Erin smiled and said âoh, helpfulâ sincerely and they passed turnstiles, descended two floors, waited two minutes, sat in a train. Paul asked what Erin hadnât liked about her other boyfriends.

âLike, things that have just bothered me?â

âLetâs just talk about . . . Harris,â said Paul.

âOkay. Um, bothered me that he, like, had a lot of friends and a big social life. And didnât seem to be okay with how I just had him and one other friend. Heâd be like âyou need to focus on me less and get more friends.â I felt bothered that that was constant. And I didnât like it that sometimes he seemed to make insensitive comments. There was one incident where I had to get a . . . surgery-type thing on my, like, cervix . . . thing.â

âWhat was it?â

âTo remove precancerous cells, or something.â

âWhoa,â said Paul.

âThey had to, like, burnââ

âIs that normal?â

âYeah, relatively, but I couldnât do anything for three weeks, then finally when we did . . . this weird-looking thing came out? And, I donât know, I felt really self-conscious, and the first thing he was just like âewâ and, like, backed away from me and I was like âI canât help it.â I donât know. It bothered me at the time but now . . . I donât know.â

âAre you on birth control right now?â

âNo. I havenât had my period but Iâve also taken three pregnancy tests, Iâm not pregnant.â

âWhen did you take three pregnancy tests?â

âPeriodically. One time I didnât have my period for a year and a half. I feel like I should get on birth control. Because I have my period when Iâm on it.â

âIsnât it healthier to not be on it?â

âYeah. Thatâs why Iâm not on it.â

âIt seems fine,â said Paul vaguely.

âReally?â

âYeah,â said Paul trying to remember something he wanted to say on the topic of friends. âIt . . . doesnât matter to me if I come in you or somewhere else.â

âOkay,â said Erin.

âUm,â said Paul distractedly.

âThis is probably the most that a guy has come in me without being on it. But I figure if anything happens weâre probably similarly . . . minded.â Erin looked at Paul with an ironic expression and placed a hand on his shoulder. âBecause you want to have kids,â she said in a mock-serious voice. âSoon. Right?â

Paul nodded, aware he probably appeared confused.

âThat was our goal in getting married,â said Erin.

Paul patted her thigh twice and grinned a little.

âWeâre not in sin anymore,â said Erin completing the joke, mostly to herself, it seemed.

âIâve always, um, felt like . . .â said Paul quietly.

âHuh?â said Erin staring at his blank expression.

âWeird about friends,â murmured Paul. âI never hang out with other people if Iâm in a relationship.â

Erin nodded rapidly, seeming a little anxious.

âWeâre here,â said Paul, and they exited the train as it said XIMEN STATION (and something about Chiang Kai-shek) in Mandarin, Cantonese, Taiwanese, English in a female, robot voice. Paul sneezed and looked at his hands rubbing the front of his shirt, aware of Erin also looking, both with neutral expressions. âUm,â said Paul on an up escalator to another train platform. âHow did you deal with Harris having that many friends?â

âI would hang out with them. Harris and I were similar in the way we would joke about things, and I liked that his friends seemed to like me . . . or, like, they laughed at me, and him, when we were together. But it was weird because it was obvious that I never became friends with any of them. What problems . . . do you have?â

âWith friends?â

âGirlfriends. The same question you asked me.â

âWith . . . who?â

âUh, with Michelle,â said Erin.

âJust . . . her friends,â said Paul on an up escalator to the stationâs main floor. âShe would want to hang out with friends. And I wouldnât want to . . .â

âIs there anything about her? Like, as a person.â

âI feel like we werenât perfectlyâwe werenât, um, optimally excited by each other.â

âHow? How?â

âJust, like, she didnât like the same things that I liked . . . as much.â

âOh,â said Erin. âLike On the Road things?â

âYeah,â Paul said, who hadnât liked On the Road as much as Michelle, who had rated one of his favorite books, Chilly Scenes of Winter, which sheâd said she âliked,â two out of five stars on Goodreads, after their relationship had ended. âAnd then, uh, I felt like maybe she . . . had a slightly neurotic aversion toward blow jobs, I feel,â said Paul.

âSeriously? I wouldnât expect that.â

âShe would do it, but not as much as I would to her, I think,â said Paul as they reached street level, at an intersection, where two corner buildings seemed armored with layers of billboards and lighted signs and, near the top of one, like a face, a giant screen, showing a movie preview. On a plaza was a donation bucket decorated like a Christmas tree and a grand piano without a player. âSometimes she would joke about how it was âdegrading,â but I feel like she wasnât completely joking.â

They entered the area blocked off to cars.

âSo maybe I wasnât satisfied with that,â said Paul.

âWhat other things sexually?â

âSexually?â

âAbout her, or about anybody.â

âUh, I donât have that many sexual complaints. What about you?â

âWith Kent it got really boring and routine.â

âHow?â

âIt was just the same thing. He would go down on me, then we would have missionary style, and thatâs it . . . thatâs, like, it. Harris, similarly, we never really gave each other oral sex, toward the middle and end. But I really like that, both ways. And it also became sort of the same thing with him, where we would do missionary. Then I would . . .â

âThen you would . . .â

â . . . like, finger myself,â said Erin at a lower pitch with a complicated expression that Paul saw peripherally.

âYou would finger yourself? While he was doing it?â

âYeah,â said Erin.

âDid you like that?â

âIt was okay. Seemed business-oriented. So we could both . . .â

Paul made a noise indicating he understood.

âHow do you feel about . . .â

âWhat?â said Paul, dimly aware and liking that theyâd remained focused on their conversation instead of acknowledging their new, intense environment, which was bright and chaotic and crowded but, without vehicles, relatively quiet, more calming than stressful. Paul felt like he and Erinâand their conversationâwere in the backseat of a soundproofed, window-tinted limousine.

âHow we have sex?â

âSeems fine,â said Paul.

âDo you have any critiques? Any.â

âCritiques,â said Paul. âUm, no.â

âReally? You can say.â

âCritiques,â said Paul.

âOr anything. Any thoughts.â

âUm, no. I donât think itâs that big of a thing for me: sex.â

âYeah,â said Erin vaguely.

âWhat do you have about thatâwith me?â

âI have none for you,â said Erin.

âAre you sure? You can say it.â

âNo, youâre good at everythingââ

âReally?â

ââand you keep it interesting,â said Erin.

âReally?â

âAnd I have orgasms . . . regularly.â

Paul made a quiet noise of acknowledgment.

âEverythingâs good,â said Erin.

Paul repeated the noise.

âBut I also donât feel like itâs a big thing. Do you feel thirsty?â

âWeâll get something,â said Paul nodding distractedly. âWhat else?â

âHm. For sex?â

âAnything,â said Paul.

âAnything,â said Erin in a child-like voice.

âUm,â said Paul, and from somewhere behind them someone began playing piano. Paul instantly felt a sheen of wetness to his now âhorizontally seeking,â it seemed, eyeballs. In the movie of his life, he knew, now would be the momentâlike when a character quotes Coleridge in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as the screen shows blurry, colorful, festive images of people outside at nightâto feel that the world was âbeautiful and sad,â which he felt self-consciously and briefly, exerting effort to focus instead on the conversation, which was producing its own, unmediated emotions. âUm,â he said shifting his MacBook.

âI can hold,â said Erin taking the MacBook.

âWhat else for you?â

âNothing,â said Erin.

âWhat other questions do you have?â

âI was mainly wondering about the sexual stuff. I like asking questions like this, though.â

âAsk me,â said Paul mock pleading.

âDo you usually ask questions like this?â

âUm, no. I think itâsâsome of itâsâbecause weâre on drugs.â

âOh yeah,â said Erin.

âBut we also ask questions at other times.â

âYeah,â said Erin. âWhat do you feel about the drugs thing? In terms of your life, long term.â

âUm. I think itâs sustainable, as long as Iâm healthy. Or I think if Iâm really healthy Iâll be better off than someone who isnât healthy and doesnât do drugs. And doing drugs encourages me to be healthy, which increases productivity, which seems good. What do you think?â

âI feel like this is the most drugs Iâve ever done in a period in life,â said Erin. âBut itâs also the healthiest Iâve been, in life. I think similarly about it.â

âIn some relationships I would use food to console myself.â

âMe too,â said Erin. âBig-time.â

âThereâs not that, with us, so thatâs good.â

âYeah,â said Erin. âIâve done that a lot.â

âMe too. Eating a ton of shitty food. Being excited with the other person about food . . . seems depressing. We also donât drink alcohol, which seems good.â

âYeah,â said Erin. âI did the food thing with Harris. And Beau. When you and I had started hanging out, but not romantically or something, I was eating sushi and Beau got something fried and was like âdonât you just want to eat unhealthy things together and bond over that?â â

âNone of your boyfriends cared about you eating a lot?â

âKent wanted me to, like, gain some weight. Harris . . . quietly resented my body, I think, or something. He was really skinny. And I gained like five or ten pounds in the course of dating him. Andââ

âWhat did he resent?â

âJust thatââ

âWas he skinnier than me?â

âMaybe . . . yeah. Or, like, less muscular. He was maybe a little bit taller but really small.â

âWhat did he resent?â

âI think âresentâ isnât the right word. I think . . . no, he did resent it because I weighed more than him and I think he didnât like that he had to put up with it, instead of being with a naturally smaller body.â

âThen wouldnât he care if you ate a lot?â

âYeah, but we never stopped eating a lot.â

âOh,â said Paul.

âOr maybe he would care, but not that much. I donât know. What is my body . . . do you have problems with my body?â

âNo . . . what problems?â

âOr, do you like it?â

âYeah,â said Paul at a higher pitch than normal.

âIf you donât you can . . . something,â said Erin lightly.

âNo, yeah, I do,â said Paul. âWhat would your ideal body be?â

âFor me?â

âFor a boyfriend,â said Paul.

âI donât think Iâve thought that. Just, like, skinny and healthy looking. Like, Iâve never minded if . . . hm.â

âNot âminded.â âIdeal.â â

âOh. Then yeah.â

âWhat,â said Paul.

âI guess weigh a little more than me. Enough to not be self-conscious about it. Or just not care. I donât know. What aboutââ

âI think my ideal is, like, the same, I think, orââ

âReally?â said Erin.

âYeah,â said Paul, who was an inch taller than Erin and weighed a little less.

âOh,â said Erin anxiously.

âOr, likeââ said Paul.

âThe same,â said Erin.

âBut I think overall it doesnât matter that much.â

âYeah,â said Erin.

âBecause Michelle . . .â

âShe seemed really skinny,â said Erin.

âI think what matters to me most, in terms of that, is just that things arenât getting worse.â

âYeah,â said Erin. âMe too.â

âI think I can get fixated on that neurotically.â

âI do with myself definitely,â said Erin. âYou mean for yourself?â

âNo,â said Paul. âOther people.â

âHow do you mean?â

âI can become fixated on it.â

âOn, like, in what way?â

âOn what the other person weighs.â

âOh,â said Erin.

âI feel like itâs neurotic to some degree,â said Paul.

âI donât care that much,â said Erin ambiguously.

âIf they weighed the ideal I would find some other neurotic thing to focus on.â

âYou would find something else to focus on?â

âYeah,â said Paul.

âLike body-wise, or something elseâwise?â

âSomething elseâwise.â

âOh,â said Erin.

âItâs not a solution, or something, to find someone with the ideal . . . but focusing on not getting worse seems fine to me.â

âYeah,â said Erin.

âYeah,â said Paul slowly.

âYeah,â said Erin. âThat seems like . . .â

âYou have to focus on something, andââ

â7-Eleven,â said Erin pointing.

âHuh?â said Paul, distracted from the conversation for the first time since he heard the piano, and couldnât remember what heâd wanted to say. He followed Erin into 7-Eleven, feeling imponderable to himself, like his brain was of him, external as a color, shooting away from its source.



âI feel irritated by all the stuff going on,â said Erin on a wide sidewalk parallel to a four-lane street, outside the area of closed-off streets, around twenty minutes later. âOr like I canât concentrate on talking.â Paul had become quiet after 7-Eleven and had talked slowly and incoherently, he felt, on topics that didnât interest him, with increasing calmness, and now felt peacefully catatonic, like a person in a photograph, except for a pressure to speak and a vague awareness that he couldnât remember what Erin had last said.

âDo you feel anything from the MDMA?â

âYeah,â said Paul in a bored voice.

âHow do you feel?â

âAbout what?â said Paul.

âDo you feel happy? Or do you feel what?â

âRight now?â said Paul, as if stalling.

âYeah,â said Erin.

âYeah, happy,â said Paul looking down a little, aware his face hadnât moved in a long time. âPhysically uncomfortable a little. I want to poop.â

âYou what? What was the last thing?â

âI want to poop,â mumbled Paul.

âI feel like I want to hit people, a little,â said Erin grinning.

âLetâs go in one of those places,â said Paul slowly, with a sensation of not being prepared to speak and not yet knowing what he was saying. He listened to what heâd said and pointed at a building that said PARTY WORLD and, seeing his arm, in his vision, sensed he hadnât carried his MacBook in a long time and should offer to carry it soon.

âYeah,â said Erin distractedly.

They walked silently for around forty seconds.

âWhat are you thinking about?â

âI donât know,â said Paul honestly. âWhat are you?â

âI thought âI wonder what weâre going to do.â Then I thought âwe arenât talking anymoreâoh no, why arenât we talking anymore.â Youâre not upset about anything?â

Paul shook his head repeatedly.

âOkay, okay,â said Erin.

âNo,â thought Paul emotionlessly.

âPeople seem to be looking a lot, at the computer.â

âI havenât . . . noticed anyone,â said Paul.

âOh,â said Erin uncertainly. âI havenâtââ

âI havenât been looking at anyone.â

âI havenât either, really, except sometimes if I look out somebody will be looking. I forgot weâre not in America.â

âI like how quiet it is,â said Paul.

âMe too,â said Erin.

âIn New York it would be so loud.â

âYeah. There would be, like, layers upon layers of noises.â

âI donât like places . . . where everyone working is a minority . . . because I feel like thereâs too many different . . . I donât know,â said Paul with a feeling like he unequivocally did not want to be talking about what he was talking about, but had accidentally focused on it, like a telescope a child had turned, away from a constellation, toward a wall.

âLike, visually?â

âUm, no,â said Paul. âJust that . . . they know theyâre minorities . . .â

âThat they, like, band together?â

âUm, no,â said Paul on a down escalator into the MRT station they exited around an hour ago.

âWhat are we doing?â said Erin in a quiet, confused voice. Paul felt his diagonal movement as a humorless, surreal activityâa deepening, forward and down.

âMinorities,â said Erin at a normal volume. âWhat were you saying?â

âJust that . . . here, when you see someone, you donât know . . . that . . . they live like two hours away and are um . . . poor, or whatever,â said Paul very slowly, like he was improvising an erasure poem from a mental image of a page of text.

âIs this the mall? Thing?â

âNo, bathroom,â mumbled Paul.

âHuh?â said Erin.

âBathroom,â said Paul after a few seconds.



â¢ â¢ â¢



In the MRT station Paul said he tried masturbating and couldnât and that he was worried he vomited some of his MDMA earlier, because he didnât feel much. Erin said she felt like she was âfeeling it a lot moreâ than Paul and laughed a little and said Paul should âgo back and take more.â

âReally?â said Paul quietly.

âYeah. Because I feel like if you were also feeling it . . .â

âWhat,â said Paul.

âNow I feel myself being chill, or something. Or I donât know. I didnât know what was going on. I thought it seemed like you werenât feeling anything.â

âReally?â said Paul with earnest wonderment.

âYeah. Letâs just go back and do more, then come back.â

âAll right,â said Paul in a voice as if reluctantly acquiescing.

âDo you want that?â

âYeah. Iâll take two, you take one.â

âOkay,â said Erin.

âBut . . . now Iâm going to have it stronger than you.â

âIâll take one and a half,â said Erin.



After both ingesting two ecstasy and, almost idly, as sort of afterthoughts, because it had been very weak the past few times, a little LSD, they exited Paulâs room, and Erin went to the bathroom. Paulâs mother asked Paul what clothes he bought. Paul said he didnât yet and his mother said he should buy thicker clothing and they discussed where, at this time, around 10:30 p.m., to find open stores. When Erin exited the bathroom Paulâs mother asked if she bought any clothes.

âNo,â said Erin smiling. âNot yet.â

âOkay,â said Paul in Mandarin. âWeâre going now.â

âCell phone,â said Paulâs mother in Mandarin.

âIâve got it,â said Paul in Mandarin.

âBring a cell phone,â said Paulâs father in Mandarin from out of view, watching TV.

âWhy are you bringing your computer?â said Paulâs mother in Mandarin.

âWe, just,â said Paul in Mandarin.

âOh, youâre going to record again,â said Paulâs mother in Mandarin in a slightly scolding voice, but without worry, it seemed, maybe because she could see that Paul was the same as last year. âThe âvideo thing,â isnât it better?â

âWhat video thing?â

âI sent it to you. I bought it for you. For your birthday. Did you already sell it?â

âNo. I have it in my room.â

âWhatâs it called?â

âFlip cam,â said Paul.

âDad went to many different places asking which was the best. Why donât you use it?â

âWhat are you all talking about?â said Paulâs father idly in Mandarin from out of view.



âMy mom probably knows weâre on drugs, or something,â said Paul after theyâd walked around two minutes without talking. âShe sounded suspicious when she saw us recording. But she seemed okay with it. I searched my emails with her earlier and . . . she said something like âitâs okay to experience new things but donât overdo it,â or like âitâs probably good for a writer to experiment,â and she was talking about cocaine, I think.â

âI thought your mom was completely against drugs.â

âMe too,â said Paul. âI forgot an entire period of emails where she seemed okay with it. My brother, I think, told her, at one point, that I had too much self-control to become addicted to anything. My brother told her not to worry, I think. I donât know.â

âI havenât swallowed the LSD yet,â said Erin at a red light a few minutes later. âMy throat wonât push it down to my stomach, itâs weird.â Paul distractedly pointed at a billboard of disabled people, then looked at Erinâs tattoo of an asterisk behind her earlobe as she looked at the billboard. âIn Taiwan only disabled people, I think, can sell lottery tickets,â said Paul slowly while imagining being heard by thousands of readers of a future book, or book-like experience, in which Erinâs name had an asterisk by it, indicating the option of stopping the narrative to learn about Erin, in the form of a living footnote, currently pointing the MacBook at the three-lane street, on which hundreds of scooters and motorcycles passing, in layers, with more than one per lane, at different speeds, appeared like a stationary, patternless shuffling.

âSwarming,â Erin was saying. âSwarm. Swarm.â

âMy mom warned against getting hit by a car,â said Paul.

âDoes it happen a lot?â

âI donât know,â said Paul as a car honked. âI donât know.â

âI kind of have to pee again,â said Erin crossing the street.

âYou have to pee? Weâll find somewhere.â

âIn my public-speaking class, on the last day, this guy spoke about how he has kidney failure and canât pee. At all. He poops his pee.â

âHe doesnât even have a tube?â

âNo,â said Erin.

âHow old is he?â

âTwenty-four,â said Erin.

âWhoa,â said Paul.

âYeah. And he has a big thing in his armâhis dialysis machine.â

âFrom drinking alcohol?â

âHe didnât say why,â said Erin, and a man wearing a motorcycle helmet in the near distance walked briskly across the sidewalk, seeming âtoo comfortable in his motorcycle helmet,â thought Paul with mock disapproval, into a 7-Eleven.

âWhat if we just moved here,â said Paul.

âLetâs move here,â said Erin with enthusiasm.

âSince we donât have friends. What would we do all the time?â

âWork on writing,â said Erin. âWeâd have to go back, to do promotion things.â

âWe can pay people to pretend to be us.â

âInterns,â said Erin.

âBackpacks,â said Paul a few minutes later about a vat-like container of generic-looking backpacks, outside a foot-wear store. âWhat do you think of these?â

âThey seem good. Simple.â

âYour red backpack . . . is really dirty,â said Paul, and laughed nervously.

âIt only looks dirty. I clean it a lot.â

âBackpack,â said Paul touching a black backpack.

âI would buy one but my mom said sheâs buying me one for Christmas,â said Erin.



After peeing in an MRT station they decided to find a McDonaldâs and improvise Taiwanâs First McDonaldâs. Paulâs MacBook had seventy-two minutes of battery power remaining. They couldnât find a McDonaldâs, after around five minutes, but two Burger Kings were in view, so they decided to do Taiwanâs First Burger King, then crossed a street and saw a McDonaldâs, six to ten blocks away. âLetâs not talk until we get there,â said Paul. âBut start thinking.â

âLetâs not think of what to say, letâs just do it,â said Erin.

âJust as an experiment, letâs not talk until we get there.â

âOh,â said Erin. âOkay, okay.â

Paul stared at her with an exaggeratedly disgusted expression, which she reciprocated. They ran diagonally across three lanes to a median and held their open palms out to motorcyclists advancing in the spaces between slow-moving and stopped cars, as if by vacuum suction. Two people on one motorcycle shouted âhey, hey, go, yeah!â and slapped Erinâs palm. Paul and Erin, both smiling widely, crossed to a sidewalk and turned toward McDonaldâs. Paul took the MacBook and stared in earnest fascinationâfeeling almost appalled, but without aversionâas Erin ran and leaped stomach-first onto the front of a parked car, then speed-walked away with arms tight against her sides, crossing Paulâs vision, supernatural and comical as a mysterious creature on YouTube, before calmly taking the MacBook. Paul stared angrily at the sidewalk with his body bent forward, imagining a powerful magnet dragging him by a strip of metal at the top of his forehead. He began hitting his head with balled fists. Erin hit his head, and he instantly stared at her in mock disbelief. Erin grasped the floor of an invisible opening midair with both arms extended, not fully, above her. Paul, staring with earnest astonishment, imagined a ventilation-system-like tunnel and pulled her arms down while trying to feign an expression of âfeigned disgust unsuccessfully concealing immense excitement,â as if Erin had unknowingly discovered the entrance to a place Paul had recently stopped trying (after a decade of research, massive debt, the inadvertent nurturing of an antisocial personality) to locate. He laughed and continued ahead andâtwo blocks later, nearing McDonaldâs, which had a suburban-seeming front yard of quadrilaterals of grass, a sidewalk, gigantic Christmas tree, lighted menu, driveway for the drive-thruâhe accelerated and entered McDonaldâs saying âletâs get a shot with a lot of background activity to lure them back with the rewatches,â and after a few seconds, because the first floor had only an ordering counter, was ascending stairs, to the second floor, where eight to twelve people were in forty to sixty seats.

âTry to find a celebrity face to stand in front of,â said Erin.

âIâm going to wash my face, I canât appear like this,â said Paul grinning, and went to the bathroom. When he returned Erin was picking at her hair, with elbows locked above her head, hands moving inward in a kind of puppetry, or to cast spells on her head. She left for the bathroom. Christmas music played on a loop, repeating every forty or fifty seconds. Paul looked at what seemed to be a group of mute people in a separate, attached, somewhat private room and thought of a documentary about a woman who became deaf and mute as a teenager and remained on her bed feeling depressed, she said, for fifteen years before devoting her life to traveling across Germany teaching the deaf-mute language and âbringing outâ those, born deaf-mute, with whom communication had never been attempted. Paul was absently drumming the table with his hands when Erin returned. He stood and said they should start the documentary outside, pointed at the attached room, said âlook, those people are mute, I think.â

Erin seemed confused and slightly frightened.

âMute,â said Paul. âItâs a group of mute people.â

âOh, mute. Jesus, I thought I was having a drug thing.â

âJesus,â said Paul.

âTheyâre like how we were,â said Erin.

âOh yeah,â said Paul.

âWhen we couldnât talk, I felt like I had to talk,â said Erin descending stairs. âBut I had nothing to say. I just felt encompassed by the limits.â



They sat on a grassy area of the medianâafter deciding to begin Taiwanâs First McDonaldâs âin the middle of trafficââand criticized their own, while complimenting each otherâs, hair and faces for three minutes until Paul abruptly stood and said âletâs go insideâ with a sensation of âsurveyingâ the premises, though his eyes were unfocused.

âI started feeling things big-time,â said Erin.

âMe too,â said Paul.

âBig-time style,â said Erin, and they ran across the street into McDonaldâs, to the second floor. âWeâre back . . . here . . . again,â said Paul, and laughed a little while feeling the situation was hilarious.

âYeah,â said Erin laughing, and they returned outside.

âYou be the host,â said Paul pointing the MacBook at Erin, who stood in front of the lighted menu the size of a blackboard.

âFor Bravo,â said Erin.

âUse âthe voice.â Just donât grin.â

âOkay, okay,â said Erin.

âJust donât grin,â said Paul.

âWell, hereâs the flagship, uh, Taipeiâs firââ

âLet me try,â said Paul giving Erin the MacBook.

Erin made noises indicating failure, self-disgust.

âSo this is the first McDonaldâs to open, in, um, well, Taiwan,â said Paul. âIt opened on . . . Tuesday. They had the grand opening special of three patties.â He moved his ear to an image of a Double Filet-O-Fish on the menu and said âit doesnât want to be filmedâ to Erin, who said âthe camera is not onâ with exaggerated enunciation to the Double Filet-O-Fish. âHere is . . . this is Hillary Clintonâs hairstyle,â said Paul pointing at lettuce protruding from a chicken sandwich.

âTactical, um,â said Erin.

âExplosions,â said Paul after a few seconds.

âWell, yeah,â said Erin.

âJesus,â said Paul, and they both grinned a little. âAll right. Now weâll go inside for a closer look . . . at the conflict, the controversy.â Through the glass front a deliveryman, wearing a motorcycle helmet, peeked around a corner at the ordering counter. âItâs been said that heâs actually the founder of McDonaldâs,â said Paul. âThey stole his idea, now he just looks. I actually just heard someone talking about it over there. That guy!â

Erin pointed the MacBook at a man scurrying away from McDonaldâs.

âHe wonât go âon the record,â â said Paul. âHeâs too afraid.â

âLetâs move inside,â said Erin, and pointed at a PUSH sticker. âOh, this is actuallyââ

âThey had to add that. Because people actually were trying to, umââ

âPull,â said Erin.

âYeah, pull,â said Paul grinning, and didnât move for two seconds, unsure if there was more to say about the PUSH sticker, then took the MacBook and entered McDonaldâs. âNow, this,â he said about a tall structure obscured by colorful balloons.

âItâs been said that this is actually a performance art piece. Itâs meant to represent . . . just universal peace,â said Erin, and an employee walked between the structure and the MacBook with an expression like everything but his mouth was grinning.

âI noticed this employee is running a little,â said Paul following him to the second floor. âDoes that mean something?â

âWell, itâs sort of characteristic of our times,â said Erin.

âWho are these people?â said Paul pointing at one of four preadolescent Caucasian girls in a blown-up photo on a wall.

âThese are all Cameron Diazâs children,â said Erin.

âWhy are there spaces between this oneâs teeth?â

âWell, the meat fills in, then they put it into one burger.â

âAnd the rest is just hair and stuff?â

âThatâsâactually, we shouldnât reveal that,â said Erin.

âAnd this is for . . . ten thousand chicken nuggets?â said Paul pointing at the space of a missing tooth. âThe gelatin required from the teeth.â

âYeah,â said Erin. âAnd actually for some . . . if you pay extra you can get a little bit of a tooth, from an actual child, and you can also get it memorialized, in a locket.â

âIf a country pays extra, their nuggets get more gelatin?â

âYes,â said Erin. âThe quality is just slightly raised.â

âI heard that Canada did that,â said Paul.

âUm, just the Saskatchewan. Theyâre the prime testing markets. Because they eat . . . they primarily eat teeth there. Thatâs their diet, I didnât know if you knew that.â

âThe Weakerthans wrote an album about that, right?â

âYeah, theyââ said Erin.

âFallow?â said Paul.

âFallow,â said Erin confidently.

âThat was about the teethââ said Paul.

âThe Saskatchewan teeth crisis,â said Erin.



âThis is where the district managers have their weekly meetings,â said Erin a few minutes later in a circular roomâwallpapered with blown-up photos of children on bikes, and pogo sticks, in the foreground of a playground, at duskâwith a padded floor and, at its center, a playground of two slides, monkey bars, a pole, a tiny bridge. Paul said a girl had different eye sizes because she was on a âMcFlurry-only dietâ and asked Erin about a Hispanic girl wearing giant, padded headphones. âSheâs actually producing right now,â said Erin. âSheâs a producer.â

âWhatâs her favorite McDonaldâs meal?â

âShe just gets a side salad,â said Erin.

âAre you serious?â

âYeah, thatâs her thing,â said Erin pointing at what seemed like an Ash Wednesday marking on her forehead. âSee? Sheâs Zen.â

âLetâs go to the opposite side of the spectrum: this girl.â

âShe gets six Big Macs,â said Erin about a pale, red-haired girl sitting in a sandbox. âShe puts it all in the McFlurry machine. And the Oreos come down.â

âJesus. She puts it in the machine? This girl?â

âShe extracts the sauce from the Big Macs, and she puts that in a cup,â said Erin.

âSo she brings it home?â

âItâs âon the go.â Sheâll just bring it anywhere.â

âThen what?â

âThen her interns are instructed to massage her, because sheâs actually a candidate for the next McChicken sandwich.â

âYou could be eating her tomorrow,â said Paul to an imagined, future viewer of Taiwanâs First McDonaldâs, and turned the MacBook to the girl with giant headphones. âYou ate her. Now you might be eating the other one.â He panned the MacBook across half the room. âOr one of these, anyway.â

âCan you talk about him?â said Erin about a chubby, closed-mouth smiling boy on a bike with training wheels, and took the MacBook. âYou shouldnât leave him out.â

âSure. This is one of the great failures of the Chicken McNugget raising program. This photo is actually . . . they told him he was supplying Thailandâs artificial flavoring from 2010 to 2020. He was really happy, which was his mistake.â

âTheyâre actually going to tell her,â said Erin pointing at a girl, half obscured by a bored-looking dog, midair on a pogo stick. âSheâs supplying Thailand until 2020, with a nonexclusive option at extending her contract.â

âNice,â said Paul.

âSheâs Miss Thailand,â said Erin.

âThis one doesnât know heâs also going to be one,â said Paul about a boy on swings at the apex of his backward movement. âTheyâre all going to be one.â

âWell, yeah. Someday.â

âEven you,â said Paul.

âIâm . . . uniquely . . .â

âYou know youâre going to be a Chicken McNugget.â

âIâve accepted it,â said Erin.



They approached stairsâblocked by a dry mophead and what seemed to be a traffic coneâto a third floor, a few minutes later, ascending to a small dark room of additional seating, kaleidoscopically lit from outside sources through two windows.

âIt took them five years to Photoshop this,â said Paul pointing at the letter M inside a circle on a wall. âThey had to wait for Adobe to answer a question they had, on a message board.â

âThe mother brain,â said Erin.

âShh,â whispered Paul tracing the circle with a forefinger.

âSorry,â whispered Erin. âThe brainstorming process is in action.â

âJesus,â whispered Paul taking the MacBook carefully.

âThis isââ said Erin pointing at a pile of plastic-wrapped plastic utensils.

âLeftovers,â said Paul.

ââjust the scraps of ideas that get sold to Burger King and Arbyâs on eBay.â

âArbyâs needs to update its credit card information.â

âIt will, it always does,â said Erin, and approached the darkest part of the room. âAnd here we have the brainchild, really, of this whole operation,â she said pointing at where the wall, due to lack of light, was indiscernible in color and texture.



â¢ â¢ â¢



âSo, weâve shown you what itâs about, and what it does, for the country,â said Paul in front of the Christmas tree. âNow letâs go over the main points again: one.â

âCameron Diazâs foundation,â said Erin.

âTwo?â

âOne-A,â said Erin.

âOne-A?â

âOne-A,â said Erin. âAnd then one-B.â

âUm,â said Paul grinning, and pointed at the third-floor windows. âWe were there.â

âThe brainstorm. The conspiracy.â

âAndâremember this?â said Paul pointing at the Double Filet-O-Fish.

âYeah, whoa. Seems like so long ago.â

âAnd then,â said Paul moving toward the entrance. âThe performance art for world peace. Highly suggested.â

âThe, um,â said Paul noticing a headset-wearing employee inside McDonaldâs, looking at him suspiciously, it seemed. âThe arts sector.â

âWe didnât do the drive-thru.â

âUm,â said Paul distractedly.

âOne of the first, and worst, in Asia,â said Erin, and someone behind them said something that Paul didnât comprehend. The person repeated himself. Paul turned around and the headset-wearing employeeâa manager, it seemedârepeated himself again, in a sort of pleading voice.

âWe arenât,â said Paul in Mandarin. âWeâre only doing video. We finished.â

The employee said âyou canâtâ in Mandarin and a word Paul didnât comprehend.

âWe wonât,â said Paul in Mandarin. âThereâs just us two only.â

âSkype,â said Erin quietly.

âVacation,â said Paul, and the employee looked at Erin, then Paul. They were standing where cars, after ordering, would pass to get to the pickup window.

âOh, okay,â said the employee, and smiled a little and, after a pause, moved backward a few steps before turning around, walking away.

âVacation,â said Paul grinning.

âSkype,â said Erin.

âWeâre on vacation,â said Paul.

âSkype,â said Erin grinning, and they entered a dark, quiet, residential area of tall buildings behind McDonaldâs, then briefly explored âone of the more glamorous alleyways in Taipei,â said Paul, before returning to McDonaldâs âfront yard,â where a young man wearing a scratched, black, melon-like helmet and thick-lensed glasses, standing at a bike rack, with two McDonaldâs bags in his bikeâs basket, stared carelessly into the distance as his hands, below him, fumbled idly with his bike lock, it seemed.

âThe binge in action,â said Erin. âYet another successful binge operation.â

âThis is the best part of the binge. Heâs imagining the nuggets. Heâs already imagining his next trip. So much so that this is it . . . this is the next trip.â

âThe infinite loop of binge eating,â said Erin.

âWeâre looking at his mental projection of himself.â

âWeâre inside his brain right now.â

âWeâre looking at our creator,â said Paul grinning wildly.

âShit,â said Erin, and laughed. âThatâs why he canât move.â She noticed a few minutes later that the MacBook was âdepleted,â a word theyâd begun using to sympathetically reference anything that had temporarily exhausted a replenishable means.

On the way back to the apartment, to get a charger, they decided instead of a documentary to make a science-fiction movie, on the conceit that they existed because a young man in Taipei, while eating a bag of Chicken McNuggets, allowed himself (despite knowing this would definitely increase his unhappiness) to realistically imagine his next binge, when he would have two bags. Paul and Erin were constructed by the young manâs unconscious, for verisimilitude, as passersby in the peripheral vision of his imaginary next trip to McDonaldâs. Their memories were not based on a concrete reality but on the meager imaginative powersâenough for only a very short-term, working memoryâallotted for the âartificial intelligenceâ of peripheral passersby.

Paul and Erin discussed their movie in a dialogue that sometimes overlapped with their inner monologues, which they sometimes introduced to the dialogue, or abandoned to focus on the dialogue, or both externalized, like pets into a shared space, to observe. That the universe was how it was, and that certain things seemed incomprehensible, that Paul couldnât, without increasingly unexertable amounts of effort, remember what he didnât store outside himself, as words, in books, that remembering seemed to require as much, or much more, energy as imagining, all seemed, while on LSD, in a context of science fiction, explainable in excitingly interconnected and true-seeming ways.



At the apartment, around 1:30 a.m., they got a charger and Paul wrote a note to his mother that he and Erin were at McDonaldâs or downstairs. They somehow didnât remember they were on LSD, so didnât discern and attribute the effects of LSD until, on their way to a different McDonaldâs, crossing a street, Paul realized he was repeatedly becoming conscious of things in medias res, like the information he received from sensory perception wasnât being processed immediately, but at a delay sometimes, resulting in microseconds to seconds of partialâbut functioningâunconsciousness.

At the McDonaldâs where five employees had stood outside with megaphones and banners they sat in a corner on the second floorâthe only two customers on the floorâand recorded more footage, using their iPhones, for their science-fiction movie. They regularly reminded each other that the LSD would soon start weakening, as it continued intensifying, to a degree that Paul could sense the presence of a metaphysical distance, from where, if crossed, he would not be able to return, therefore needed to focus, with deliberate effort, against a default drifting in that direction. Around 4:30 a.m. they walked twelve blocks to the apartment, holding hands and concentrating on and reminding each other of the taskâto walk to the apartment without getting lost or hit by a car.

They looked at the internet in a downstairs area until Paulâs parents woke, then showered and went outside to a sunny, warm morning. They lay on a suburban area of grass in front of a stadium by the apartment building, no longer excited or interested in their science-fiction movie, having forgotten or become tolerant toward its most exciting, beginning elaborationsâdiscussed most intensely after Paulâs MacBook stopped recording. If they existed only in abstraction, as an unconscious aside in someoneâs brain, this forgetting, indicative of decreasing interest, would be exactly what he would predict to happen, he weakly thought with predictably less interest and clarity, on his back, with eyes closed.

The next two times they ingested ecstasy they both felt what they termed âoverdrive,â which for Paul was a whirring, metallic, noise-like presence that induced catatonia and rendered experience tonelessânullifying humor, irony, sarcasm, intimacy, meaningâso that he became like a robot that could discern (but not process, consider, or interrelate) concrete reality. Both times, after forty talkative minutes, Paul became silent and thoughtless and expressionless and suddenly disinterested in Erin and intenselyâonly sexuallyâinterested in strangers and he tried masturbating in public bathrooms and couldnât orgasm or feel pleasure, to any degree, as if lacking the concept, but felt continuously aroused âsomewhere,â including sometimes, it seemed, outside his body, a few feet in front of him, or far in the distance, in a certain store or area of sky, or in an overlap, shifting in and out of his chest or head or the front of his face.

Their brand of ecstasy, Erin learned from the internet, contained MDA, which they attributedâunconvincingly, because theyâd previously enjoyed the same brandâas the cause of âoverdrive.â



One night, while sober, they were at a red light at a busy, quietâunnaturally muffled, it seemedâintersection of a four-lane street and an eight-lane street, into the X of which a two-lane street asymmetrically stopped, as if the intersection had been built to memorialize where a traveler, by choice or not, had stopped going somewhere.

Paul felt an oppressive sensation of being confined by the most distant things he could see in any direction, like after Michelle had walked away and heâd stood motionless in the rain, except then thereâd also been a feeling of possibility, a glimmer of eagerness as he walked over the shiny, wet street, to return to the party. In an effort to distract from this feeling he asked, somewhat unexpectedly, what Erin was thinkingâtheyâd stopped asking because it was always something depressingâand, with a slight grin, he saw peripherally, she said sheâd been thinking that Paul needed to return her, like a broken appliance to a store, because she needed to be replaced with a newer, upgraded model. Paul stared ahead, wishing she hadnât said that. âNo,â he said grinning vaguely, unsure exactly howâbut suspecting strongly thatâtheir relationship due to what sheâd said had changed in some notable, irreversible manner.

The next night in a bookstore near Taipei 101, the third-tallest building in the world, an hour after ingesting MDMA, walking aimlessly with held hands, Paul âgrimly,â he earnestly felt, asked what Erin was thinking about, and she said she was having paranoid thoughts again, âlike maybe itâs not the drugs, maybe we just donât have anything to talk about anymore.â Paul thought she was right, but argued against her by saying they had been spending too much time togetherâthat, in his other relationships, one or both people would have work or school. They sat holding each other on the floor in the fiction section and decided to not ingest their remaining two ecstasy and to be apart from each other four hours a day. Paul was wearing a striped sweater he and Erin bought, a few days ago, solely because it was comically not his normal style.

Manually descending a down escalator, about an hour laterâholding Erinâs hand, leading them past people standing in placeâPaul realized he was (and, for an unknown amount of time, had been) rushing ahead in an unconscious, misguided effort to get away from where he was: inside himself. Concurrent with this realization was an awareness of himself from a perspective thousands of feet above, plainly showing he was doing what he logically knew he did not want to do (that he dreaded doing, in the same way he dreaded the remaining seconds on the down escalator, the minutes walking to the MRT station and waiting for the train, the six-minute walk from the station to the apartment, waiting for the elevator and lying in bed until an instantaneous transport to the next dayâs minutesâwas there no reprieve even in sleep?âheâd always felt comforted by sleep and now felt confused by it) and yet, even now, discerning this, kept doing what caused this realization.



On Christmas Eve, when Erin returned from the bathroom and lay on the bed, ready to sleep, it seemed, Paul asked if sheâd had any thoughts, since arriving in Taiwan, about showering.

âNot really,â she said after a few seconds.

âI noticed you donât shower at night anymore. Or havenât the last two nights.â

âI donât shower every night.â

âYou did . . . before Taiwan.â

âI only shower at night if I noticeably smell,â said Erin. âThereâve been nights I havenât, with you.â

The next few minutes, sensing something combative and offendable in herâthat he hadnât beforeâPaul felt increasingly careful of his word choice and tone of voice. Erin stood, at some point, and was moving around the room. Paul said something about an area of the bed smelling bad, and Erin said âIâm stinky, all right, youâre right, Iâll go shower, I have stinky feetâ loudly, and left the room, closing the door with force. When she returned, maybe ten minutes later, Paulâs heart was still beating considerably harder than normal and he immediately left the room. In the nearly pitch-black hallway Duduâs wet nose softly touched the back of Paulâs leg, when they apparently moved in the same direction, toward the bathroom. In the shower Paul earnestly thought about how to extricate himself from the marriageâwhat to do about their film company, how to behave the next ten days, what he and Erin would separately do each day, what to say to his parentsâbut when he returned to his room Erin apologized, which he hadnât expected, and he reiterated that theyâd happily agreed, a month ago, that if either person wanted the other to shower or brush their teeth, or anything like that, theyâd state it immediately and directly and impersonally, instead of accumulating resentment.

âThere are things Iâm still sensitive about,â said Erin.

Paul said he had felt most upset by her sarcasm when she said she was stinky and how she left suddenly and sort of slammed the door. Erin said she had been joking, in an effort to downplay the situation, and hadnât meant to slam the door. Paul said he hadnât feltâor suspected, at allâthat she was joking. Erin slept on her side facing away.



In the morning Paul read an email from his mother, whose bedroom shared a wall with his, asking him to please try to be nicer to Erin, who remained on her side facing away, though she seemed awake. Paul showered for around forty-five minutes, continuing to mentally prepare to be single, and was unaware of the time until, after putting on clothes, his father said the taxi heâd called to drive them to the cafÃ© hosting Paulâs readingâhis mother was already thereâwas downstairs. Paul expected no responseâor a begrudging one, maybeâas he explained to Erin, who was still facing away, in a voice he controlled to sound neutral that a taxi was waiting and that she didnât have to go to his reading but it would be awkward if she didnât because reservations had been made for dinner immediately after, in a nice restaurant, with many relatives, to celebrate their marriage. Paul felt emotional and surprised when, after a few seconds, during which her body visibly relaxed, easing a tension Paul hadnât discerned, Erin stood and softly said she didnât know the reading was today and, prioritizing the situation, over her feelings, became accommodating and goal oriented, quickly and gracefully getting dressed and preparing to leave.

In the taxiâs backseat, between Erin and his father, Paul pointed at a bright red, metal, pointy roof outside his fatherâs sideâs window. âLook at that roof,â he said in Mandarin, and pushed a blue ecstasy into Erinâs mouthâagainst teeth, then inside, touching her tongue a littleâwhile his father talked about slanted versus flat roofs. Paul, grinning convolutedly, pointed again and asked how to say âcorrugatedâ in Mandarin and put their last ecstasy in his own mouth.



Dinner, after the readingâwith Paulâs parents, uncle, uncleâs girlfriend, uncle-in-law, great-uncle, two aunts, five cousinsâwas in a restaurant whose interior lighting, circuited into pillars and walls and the ceiling and bathrooms, though probably not in the kitchen, had been coordinated to undulate fluidly and cyclically, as one, yellow to red to purple to blue to green, seeming egregiously LSD themed.

Paulâs father talked the most, by far, usually to no one specific, during the hour-long dinner. When he spoke people became attentive to him, but passively, at their leisure, with neutral expressions, as if watching an infomercial, neither annoyed nor entertained, feeling no obligation to respond or engage. Whenever he finished with a topic, sometimes to the accompaniment of his own laughter, people seemed to uniformly and inhumanly return, like foam mattresses, to how they were before, profoundly unfazed. At one point, in what seemed like a major faux pas, in part because Paulâs cousinâs father, Paulâs uncle, was present and seemed depressed, Paulâs father triedâfor maybe five minutes, with no external feedback except two or three grunting noises from his targetâto recruit Paulâs cousin, a few years older than Paul, to work for him selling lasers on commission. Heâd tried the same, at previous dinners, with both Paul and Erinâand, at dinners last year, just Paul, who suspected his father felt as amused by his behavior, in this regard, as Paul and Erin, whoâd said âyour dad tried to recruit me to work for himâ four or five times the past week.

Paulâs relatives, though somewhat withdrawn and/or alienated from one another, seemed peaceful as a group, maybe because there didnât appear to be any pressure for anyone to do anything they didnât want to do, such as talk or smile. Paulâs mother and her older sister, best friends for decades, now seemed like polite, recent acquaintances who secretly disliked each other for admittedly irrational and/or superficial reasons.

After dinner Paul and Erin followed Paulâs uncle and Paulâs uncleâs girlfriend to their car, to be driven, at Paulâs motherâs suggestion, to where young people went to buy clothes. Failing to operate a refrigerator-size parking meter, which Paul had never seen before, Paulâs uncle grinned and said something in Mandarin conveying idle bemusement regarding his decreasing ability to comprehend and maneuver himself through an increasingly surreal environment. In the BMWâs backseat Paul remembered, with embarrassment, when as a child, on the way to Ponderosa, in this car, his uncle suggested to Paulâs mother, his little sister, a restaurant that was the same as Ponderosa but used âfresher ingredients.â Paulâs mother had asked Paul, who had responded with a noise, causing six to ten relatives to eat at Ponderosa.

Paul didnât notice his uncle had turned around in his seat, and was grinning slightly, until he heard him say âyouâre getting out here alsoâ in Mandarin. The car was parked on the side of a street and Paulâs uncleâs girlfriend had gotten out. Paulâs uncle, who spoke English fluently, congratulated Erin then carefully said two sentences to her and maybe Paul, who was remembering how heâd been surprisedâand complicatedly movedâonce when his uncle talked about buying and liking Michael Jacksonâs music, in this car, after asking if Paul, who doesnât remember what he answered, or how old heâd been, maybe 10 or 11, liked Michael Jackson.



At the airport, after a silent taxi ride, around 7:30 a.m., Paulâs mother stood with Paul and Erin in line to check in luggage. Paul peripherally noticed his mother facing away, a little, with only her neck slightly turned. He looked at her and she turned her neck farther, so that he was looking at her looking elsewhere, then she turned, openly crying, toward him and said in a child-like but controlled voice that she was leaving before she started crying harder. She reflexively opened her mouth in a similar manner as when Paul had âcaughtâ her, last year, putting sugar in her coffee, but the effect now was of further embarrassment, past helplessness, to disengagement, then withdrawal.

Paul, whose eyes had become instantly watery, hadnât seen her like this before. He thought of her mother, who had died before Paul was bornâand was aware, with momentary clarity, which did not elucidate or console, but seemed to pointlessly reiterate, of how, in the entrance-less caves of themselves, everyone was already, always orphanedâand they briefly hugged and she hugged Erin and uncharacteristically left.

Paul was in Bobst Libraryâs first basement floor, seated at a computer, becoming increasingly, âneurotically,â he knew, fixated on his aversion toward Erinâs red backpack, on the possibility that she would have it with her when he went upstairs, in fifteen minutes, to meet her and that, in its presence, he would feel upset. He hadnât seen her in three weeks, since a few days after returning from Taiwan, when she returned to Baltimore, where a drunk driver had repeatedly rammed her motherâs car, breaking her motherâs hip and badly injuring Erinâs face, which the hospital had said would heal, without scarring, in four months. Erin was wearing large, black-rimmed glassesâto block her face, she said, and they hugged.

âSorry,â said Erin with a blank expression.

âAbout what?â said Paul, aware heâd felt only self-conscious when he noticed the red backpack, in his vision like a dot on a screen during an optometristâs exam.

âFace,â said Erin. âMy face.â

âYou look good, donât worry.â

They walked holding hands toward Union Square, ten blocks north. Paul sometimes looked away, so Erin wouldnât see his depressed expression. Heâd begun to worry, some days, for hours at a time, that he was permanently losing interest in Erin, despite earnestly wanting, he felt, the opposite, if that were possible. âYou have the red backpack,â he said grinning slightly, with some confusion.

âI do,â said Erin in a tired voice.

Paul sustained his grin tensely.

âWhat do you feel about that?â

âI donât know,â said Paul looking away.

âI know you donât like it.â

âItâs . . . just,â said Paul.

âIâll buy a new one tomorrow.â

âNo,â said Paul quietly.

âI have a gift card.â

âI thought your mom was buying you one for Christmas.â

âSo did I,â said Erin.



On his mattress, on their sides, holding Erin from behind, Paul thought he wouldnât end the relationship now, or at any time while Erinâs face, which after two and a half weeks looked like it had been recently stung by eight to twelve bees, was still healing, even if he knew he wanted to, which he didnât.

But he wouldnât not end the relationship now, if he knew he wanted to, because it would be pitying and misleading, which Erin wouldnât want, based on what he knew, but maybe she wouldnât care, if she didnât know, which she wouldnât. Paul thought that he would stop thinking about himself and focus on Erin, but instead, almost reflexively, as a method of therapy, began thinking about suicide, then became aware of himself, a few minutes later, earnestly consideringâor maybe only imaginingâtrying to convince Erin that they should commit suicide together. After an initial, default âopen-mindednessâ they could easily become fixated, then would want to do it quickly, while it made sense. They would find information on the internet and hurry to a subway station, or wherever, collaborating intimately again, looking out at the world from a new and shared perspective. Paul began to feel, in a way he hadnât before, like he comprehended double suicideâthe free and mysterious activity of it, like a roller coaster descending only into darkness, but accessible from anywhere, on the theme park of Earth, always open.

He sensed his vicinity to a worldviewâor a temporary configuration of preferences, two or three ideas introduced to a moodâin which double suicide would be as difficult, as illogical, to resist as a new sushi restaurant to a couple that likes sushi and trying new restaurants. He felt scared, and to distance himself from what he might accidentally engage in, or be absorbed by, in a moment of inattention or daydreaming, he opened his eyes and leveraged himself and looked over Erinâs shoulder with an extremely troubled expression. To his surpriseâand self-consciously private confusion, relocated immediately away from the front of the face, to study laterâshe looked serene and was smiling a little, it seemed.

Three weeks later they were seated in Sunshine Cinemaâat a showing of Somewhere that would begin in five minutesâand had ingested Xanax, which hadnât taken effect, when Paul, staring at the screen, said in a monotone that he wanted to talk about their relationship. Immediately, in a sort of rush, which indicated to Paul that she wished she had said it first, an otherwise unfazed Erin said she also wanted to talk about their relationship. Paul said he felt bad about it, but didnât know what to do, or what else to say. Erin said she felt the same. They talked, staring at the screen, during previewsâmostly reiterating that they felt bad, didnât know what to do, didnât know what else to sayâand stopped, when the movie began, without resolution.

At some point, the past two or three weeks, Paul had begun to imaginarily hear Erin quietly sobbingâwhenever she was in a bathroom with the sink on, and sometimes when in bed, beside himâin a manner as if earnestly trying to suppress uncontrollable crying, not like she was crying for attention, or allowing herself to cry. He would concentrate on discerning if the crying was real, and would become convinced, to a large degree, every time, that it was, despite learning, every timeâseeing, to his consistent surprise, a friendly expression mostlyâthat it was not.

Paul became aware of himself staring, âtransfixed,â at the center of the screen, with increasing intensity and no thoughts. He focused on resisting whatever force was preventing him from moving his head or neck or eyeballs until finallyâsuddenly, it seemedâhe calmly turned his head a little and asked if Erin was bored.

âI donât know. Are you?â

âI canât tell,â said Paul. âAre you?â

âMaybe a little. Do you want to go?â

âYeah,â said Paul, and slowly stood.

On the L train Paul held Erin in a way that her head and upper body were on his lap, but her legs remained as if she were sitting upright, aware he was doing thisâwas holding her head to his lapâto mitigate pressures to talk to, or look at, each other. Erin sat up, at some point, and Paul began to speak, in vague continuation of their conversation before the movie, slowly and mostly incomprehensibly, unsure what he was trying to say. Gradually, by focusing on what heâd already said, in the past ten to twenty seconds, he learned that he seemed to be trying to convey that both he and Erin were depressed, which he realized they both already knew. He only felt motivated to say anything at all because he was on Xanax, he knew, and remembered he had Ambien in his pocket and shared one, then another, with Erin, who had sat up, then became aware of himself trying to passive-aggressively convey something by directly saying he wanted to feel pressured to concurrently be a depressed writer and fashion model.

âI donât know what youâre talking about,â said Erin.

âI just feel . . . depressed,â said Paul, and weakly grinned.

âIs there anything I can do to make you feel less depressed?â

âI donât think so,â said Paul. âYouâre depressed.â

âWhat can I do, at this point, to help our relationship?â

âI donât know,â said Paul feeling that he was more expressing himself than answering a question, and they got off the train.

âAnything at all,â said Erin in a hollow voice.

âI donât want to tell anyone what to do,â said Paul staring ahead.

âYou wouldnât be. Youâd just be answering my question.â

In Sel De Mer, a seafood restaurant four blocks from Paulâs apartment, seated at the bar, Erin asked if Paul wanted more Xanax and he said âshouldnât we not âgo overboardâ?â

âWhat do you mean?â

âWe had Ambien and Xanax.â

Erin appeared unresponsive.

âNever mind,â said Paul. âYes. I want more.â After sharing 2mg Xanax, then ordering, he absently ate all the free bread and butter, and they sat staring ahead, not speaking or moving, until Erin said she felt weird.

âMe too. I donât know what to say.â

âLetâs just stop fighting,â said Erin.

âOkay,â said Paul.

âOkay,â said Erin after a few seconds.

âDo you want more Xanax? I donât feel that much.â

âYeah,â said Erin, and they shared 2mg Xanax.

When Paulâs salad and clam chowder arrived he moved something fried from the salad, with a feeling of efficacy, into the soup, then ate it with a spoon. His steamed lobster with fries and Erinâs broiled monkfish with mesclun salad arrived. He ate his fries using all his butter and ketchup and, at her offer, most of Erinâs butter. âI feel better,â he murmured.

âWhat?â

âI feel better, due to Xanax, I think. How do you feel?â

âI donât know,â said Erin. âOkay, I guess.â



At Paulâs apartment they drank green juice and showered, then performed oral sex on each other, showered again, turned off the light to sleep. Paul said they should be on Xanax all the time. Erin said âweâre probably ideal candidates for Xanax prescriptions.â

âIâm sure that we are,â said Paul, and went to the bathroom with his MacBook and, seated on the toilet, looked at lobstersâ Wikipedia page. He typed âimmortal animalsâ in Google and clicked âThe Only Immortal Animal on Earthâ and saw a jellyfish on a website that looked like it was made in the late â90s. He copied a sentence, a few minutes later, from Taipei Metroâs Wikipedia pageââThe growing traffic problems of the time, compounded by road closures due to TRTS construction led to what became popularly known as the âDark Age of Taipei Trafficââand emailed it to Erin.

Paul entered his room carrying his open MacBook. âThis is what you ate,â he said showing Erin a photo, captioned âa monkfish in a market,â of a glistening, black, mound-shaped massâgrotesque in a melancholy, head-dominated, almost whimsical mannerâand she laughed a little.



Ten days later they were on Erinâs bed in Baltimore, around 3:45 a.m., watching a Japanese movie about a woman who tortures and murders men. The past two nights theyâd ingested large doses of MDMA and low-to-medium doses of Percocet, Adderall, Xanax and today theyâd only used a little Adder-all. Paul began to sometimes leverage himself above Erin, who would roll onto her back, or remain on her side, loosely enclosed by Paulâs arms to either side, as he stared vertically down at her with fixed, impractical, âscaryâ expressions.

Erin laughed and, the first two times, complimented his effort, then told him to stop, after which he did it again, and thought he wouldnât anymore, then did again, five minutes later, on an impulse, almost uncontrollablyâhovering low, with bent elbows, feeling both insane and, in the private room behind the one-way mirror of his exaggeratedly happy expression, like an experimental psychologistâand she began crying in a helpless and cowering manner, which Paul, to some degree, thought was feigned, so remained motionless, for two seconds, during which Erinâs face appeared unrecognizable, like the irreducible somethingness of her, in the form of a coded overlay, or invisible mask, had abruptly left, revealing the frightening activityâthe arbitrarily reconfiguring, look-less chaosâof a personless face. Paul hugged her so she couldnât see his face and repeatedly said he was sorry and variations of âitâs meâ and âitâs okay.â Erinâs eyes appeared strangely collapsed beyond closure, like rubber bands overlapping themselves, for a few seconds, after she stopped crying. âItâs just that my car is broken,â she said earnestly. âI canât get away.â

âI would have stopped if I knew you were this scared,â said Paul, confused by what sheâd been thinking to have imagined escaping in a car.

âYou should have stopped when I said stop.â

âBut people always say to stop. And you were laughing.â

âI told you to stop,â said Erin. âYou did other times and I kept going and you liked it.â

âI know,â said Erin, and described how sheâd lately felt depressed in a new and scary way, which Paul also had felt lately and described as a sadness-based fear, immune to tone and interpretation, as if not meant for humansâmore visceral than sadness, but unlike fear because it decreased heart rate and impaired the senses, causing everything to seem âdarker.â Sometimes it was less of a feeling than a realization that maybe, after you died, in the absence of time, without a mechanism for tolerance, or means of communication, you could privately experience a nightmare state for an eternity. More than once, the past few weeks, Paul had wonderedâidly, without thinking past hypothesisâif books and movies he viewed as melodramatic might be accurately depicting what, since before his book tour, he now sometimes felt. They diagnosed themselves with âseverely depleted serotonin levels,â caused by forty to eighty doses of MDMA the past three to five months. As Erinâs apartment brightened from the morning sun, through sixth-floor windows, they prepared to sleep. Erin stood at a window eating pink tablets that seemed hugeââdisk-like,â thought Paul with a blanket covering all but his head.

They looked at each other neutrally.

âI feel like those arenât good for you,â said Paul.

Erin said a doctor had recommended them and Paul said something implying it was healthier to never listen to doctors.

âHow do you know itâs not good for me?â

âYouâll become dependent, to some degree.â

âNo, I wonât, I rarely take it,â said Erin.

âYouâll become dependent to a little degree, Iâm just saying.â

âDid you read about that somewhere?â

âNot specifically,â said Paul.

âHow do you know, then?â

âBased on what I know, from things Iâve read and experienced, about tolerance, I think your body will be less able to produce something each time you use those.â

âThatâs not how everything works,â said Erin.

âIâm not trying to argue with you, based on what I know,â said Paul, aware it was funny to qualify âIâm not trying to argue with youâ with âbased on what I know,â but not feeling humored. He was standing, around twenty minutes laterâand had bought a ticket with his iPhone for a bus leaving in an hourâlooking at Erin, sitting on her bed facing away. They were both crying a little. It was below freezing and gusty outside, but Paul declined Erinâs offer of a jacket and multiple offers to drive him to the bus stopâon an unsheltered bridgeâand said bye and self-consciously left.

In early May, more than two months later, Paul was outside Bobst Library waiting for Peanutâto buy drugs for the next three days, when he and Erin would be in Pittsburgh, for a reading, then in Calvinâs mansion for two nightsâwhen he saw Juan walking past and asked what he was doing. Juan said he was buying a Clif Bar and going to the gym and asked what Paul was doing.

âIâm meeting someone to buy drugs.â

âWhat drugs are you buying?â

Peanut was approaching on the sidewalk.

âIâll tell you after, heâs there, he probably wonât want to see you,â said Paul remembering once when he and Erin got in Peanutâs car and Peanut became very still a few seconds before quietly saying âyo,â and that heâd expected one person.

âI didnât know you was a writer,â said Peanut.

âYeah,â said Paul.

âWhat books youâve written?â

âLike five books,â said Paul.

âA bookâs a book,â said Peanut, and Paul got in his car. The middle-aged woman in the driverâs seat was wearing a baseball cap. Paul wasnât sure if sheâd worn it every other time or no other time. Paul asked if Peanut had mushrooms. âNo,â said Peanut. âBut Iâm working on that for you.â

âWhat else do you have on you?â

âOn me? Iâve got a bundle of dope.â



Paul, walking toward Think Coffee, where Erin was working on writing, told Juan he bought Ketamine, MDMA, Xanax. Juan said when he tried Ketamine he felt like he could feel the solar system flying through space and that he had been on his bed and had pointed the top of his head in the same direction. Paul said he also bought heroin and Juan said he knew people when he was in high school (in Kansas, where he had been arrested for selling marijuana, Paul uncertainly knew) who used heroin and one had died.

âWhat do you mean?â said Paul vaguely.

âI think he died,â said Juan, and they slowed to a kind of loitering, as a policeman, behind them, walked past. They stood in place, then continued walking.

âWhen did they die?â

âIâm not really sure,â said Juan.

âHe died,â said Paul grinning. âHow?â

âI donât know.â

âWhy did he die?â

âI donât know. I just know he died.â



In the morning, while driving, Paul listened to music through earphones and photographed Erinâasleep with her head, against the passenger window, cushioned by the fluffy, patchwork, faded blanket loosely wrapping all but her face, like an oversize astronaut suit with no visorâaround ten times with his iPhone. In Baltimore a few days ago she had been drinking tequila alone while cleaning her apartmentâshe was moving into her fatherâs small house, in which a middle-aged couple rented a roomâand later while driving had been stopped by the police. Her mother had screamed at her in an out-of-control mannerâfor the first time in six yearsâand her father, somewhat unexpectedly, had gone into ânice mode.â Paul remembered a night, eating dinner with Michelle in her motherâs house, when he had said he felt depressed. Michelle had gone upstairs silentlyâthe house had thick, soft carpeting everywhere, even on the stairs, so that people sometimes appeared or disappeared without warningâand cried on her bed. Paul was surprised heâd forgotten that night, and emailed himself with his iPhoneâ



Remembered being depressed at dinner w Michelle in empty house



While driving to Pittsburgh w Erin asleep



Typed on iPhone in Gmail w right hand



Listening to P. S. Eliot



Left hand on steering wheel



âthen vaguely remembered another time when he had remembered the same dinner and had also felt surprised that heâd forgotten.



Paul and Erin were both upsetâtheir default, while sober, at this pointâwhen they arrived in Pittsburgh and each ingested 2mg Xanax. Paul, on a sidewalk outside Erinâs car, watched Calvin and Maggie, both grinning, as they approached and hid behind a dumpster, then walked to Paul, who had a depressed expression, which he didnât attempt to hide or mollify.

âHi,â said Calvin after a few seconds.

âWe should go to Whole Foods,â said Paul.

âIs there a Whole Foods here?â said Maggie.

âYes, Iâve been there like ten times,â said Paul peripherally aware of Erin exiting her car. âThis is where my ex-girlfriend lived. Michelle.â He looked at Calvin and Maggie, unsure if they knew of Michelle. In Whole Foods he walked aimlessly at a quick, undeviating pace, with a sensation of haunting the location. He ladled clam chowder into the largest size soup container, chose a baguette, stood in line.



â¢ â¢ â¢



After the reading, which was on the second floor of a bar, Paul stood in a shadowy room, at a billiards table, eating his baguette and soup. He said âwe should have an orgy tonightâ to Calvin, who seemed hesitant but curious. Maggie entered the room and stood with them and Paul said âwe should have an orgy tonight.â

âYeah, seems good,â said Maggie in an uncharacteristic monotone.

âBut we should film it,â said Paul.

âNo, I donât know,â said Maggie with unfocused eyes.

âOnce weâre on MDMA we wonât care,â said Paul. âAbout anything.â

âMaggieâs seventeen,â said Calvin grinning weakly.

âThatâs not underage. We can black out her face.â

âIâm not doing that,â said Maggie.

âItâs not worth doing at all if itâs not filmed,â said Paul.

âI donât want to be filmed,â said Maggie.

âShe doesnât want to be filmed,â said Calvin.

Erin entered the room and began playing catch with Maggie with a billiards ball. Paul sat on a stack of ten to fifteen chairs and continued eating his baguette and soup, feeling distantly like he was avoiding something that would eventually end his life, except it wasnât avoidable and when it did end his life he wouldnât know, because he wouldnât know anything.

âShould we switch cars, on the drive back?â said Calvin. âLike, Paul and Maggie in Maggieâs car, me and Erin in Erinâs car?â

âI donât know,â said Paul.

âSomeone else decide, Iâm going to my car to get my sandwich,â said Maggie, and went downstairs. Erin was cleaning a stain on the billiards table, it seemed, at the edge of Paulâs peripheral vision. Paul went downstairs, where he sat alone in a booth and texted Maggie, asking what kind of sandwich she was eating.



At a red light, around half an hour later, Paul threw a clementine at Erinâs car, which was ahead. The light turned green and the clementine missed Erinâs moving car. Paul got back in Maggieâs car, said he wondered what Calvin and Erin were talking about. âI feel sleepy from the food and Percocet,â he said around ten minutes later.

âI like sleeping when Iâm cold rather than when Iâm warm.â

âMe too,â said Paul. âAre you going to be hungry tonight?â

âYeah,â said Maggie after a pause.

âI kind of want to eat spaghetti,â said Paul, and laughed a little. âOr something.â

âIâll make spaghetti,â said Maggie. âNo, I donât want to eat spaghetti,â said Paul. âOh, I thought you wanted to eat spaghetti.â

âI donât know,â said Paul quickly, and a few minutes later Maggie said her brother turned 4 recently and would say things like âmy three-year-old self hates cucumbersâ but wouldnât talk about his two-year-old or one-year-old self, which Maggie thought was interesting and wanted to ask why, but kept forgetting.



At Calvinâs house everyone ingested more Percocet and Xanax and went in the basement, where Maggie and Calvin each ate a bowl of cereal and Paul, ignoring everyone, to a large degree, talked to Charles on Gmail chat, eventually eating three bowls of cereal. In bed, around 1:30 a.m., Erin asked what Paul and Charles had talked about.

âNothing,â said Paul automatically. âWe just talked about feeling depressed.â

âWhat else did you talk about?â

âI donât remember,â said Paul.

âTry to,â said Erin.

âYou can just read it tomorrow.â

âCan I read it now?â

âJust read it tomorrow,â said Paul.

âWhy canât I read it now?â

âOkay,â said Paul, and opened his MacBook.



He woke, on his back, to Calvin looking at him from the doorway. He asked if Calvin had used any drugs today. Calvin said he hadnât, and they looked at each other.

âYou havenât?â said Paul. âToday?â

âWell, a Percocet, when I woke up.â

âWhen you woke up,â said Paul in a monotone.

âOh yeahâyour alarm is going off,â said Calvin to Erin. âThatâs what I came here, to tell you.â

âOh, damn,â said Erin, and left the room.

âAre . . . you and Erin . . . having problems?â

âNo,â said Paul, and laughed a little.

Calvin appeared tired, slightly anxious.

âI mean . . . no,â said Paul looking at the ceiling. âNo.â

âIâm going to my room,â said Calvin after a few seconds.

When Erin returned, five minutes later, Paul asked where sheâd been.

âIn the bathroom,â she said. âWhere were you?â

âWhat do you mean? Iâve been right here.â

âI was in the bathroom. Sorry I didnât tell you.â

âWhat do you mean âwhere were you?â I was here when you left.â

âI know. Iâm sorry. I was trying to make a joke. It was . . . âin bad taste,â I guess.â

âDonât apologize about that,â said Paul.

After a few seconds Erin rolled over. âI misinterpreted what you said,â she said facing away. âI donât want to do that in the future.â

âStop apologizing,â said Paul.

âIâm not apologizing,â said Erin.

âOkay. Just stop talking about it.â

Erin went in the bathroom attached to the guest room, and when the shower turned on Paul immediately heard a quiet, soporific crying like something from nature. He saw Calvin and Maggie jogging into the room and covered himself with a blanket and they jumped on the bed, then repeatedly in place.



In Calvinâs SUV, that night, on the way to Target to buy hair dye, because Calvin wanted to dye and cut his hair âreally weird,â and Maggie had earnestly said âI think I want to color my face too,â Erin asked if anyone wanted Xanax; everyone did, in different amounts, which she apportioned. To her right, gently isolated in a one-person seat, holding half a Xanax bar, which was guaranteed to have an effect on him within forty minutes, Paul felt a quaintly affecting comfort and a self-conscious, fleeting urge to ask someone a question or say something nice to someone.

He thought of how, from elementary through high school, if a girl had been nice to him at school or if he got a valuable baseball or Magic: The Gathering card or if he accomplished something in a video or computer gameâif for whatever reason he felt significantly, temporarily happierâhe would get an urge to talk to his mother and sometimes would go find her, at her makeup station in her bathroom, or outside watering plants, then reveal something about his life or ask her a question about her life, knowing he was making her happy, for a few minutes, before running back to the TV, Nintendo, or computer. Sometimes, half mock scolding, mostly as an amused observation of human nature (sheâd also say she recognized the behavior in herself, that she was the same way, with certain people), Paulâs mother would tell Paul, who almost always answered her questions, her attempts at conversation, with âI donât knowâ in a kind of vocal cursive, without disconnected syllables, that he shouldnât only talk to herâto his âpoor mother,â sheâd sayâwhen he felt like talking.

Gradually, after being the target a few times of a similar capriciousness, which he discerned as default behavior for most people, and not liking it, Paul learned to not be more generous or enthusiastic or attentive than he could sustain regardless of his mood and to not talk to people if his only reason to was because he felt lonely or bored.

In college, junior and senior year, when heâd deliberately remained friendlessâafter his first relationship endedâto focus on writing what became his first book, he would force himself to email his mother (his only regular communication, those two years, once every two to four days) even when he felt depressed and unmotivated. He would always feel better after emailing, knowing his mother would be happy and that, by mastering some part of himself, heâd successfully felt less depressed without bothering, impedingâor otherwise being a distraction inâanyoneâs life.



Target was closed for an unknown reason. Paul was quiet during the ten-minute drive back to Calvinâs mansion, dimly remembering once sitting close with Erin in another back-seat, also at night, holding cups of hot tea for warmth. His memories had increasingly occurred to him without context, outside of linear time, like single poems on sheets of computer paper, instead of pages from a book with the page number and book title on top.

They used all their MDMA in Calvinâs basement while eating cake, ham, salad, cookiesâthe first time Paul had eaten food for comfort while on MDMAâthen went upstairs to Calvinâs room, where Calvin and Maggie drank beer, which Paul and Erin, who had eaten only a little food, declined. Paul began recording, at some point, with his MacBook. âIsnât it a thing?â he said after ingesting Codeine and Flexeril. âThat people warn against? Combining drugs.â

âYeah,â said Calvin, and laughed.

âI donât think thatâs true,â said Erin shyly.

âIâm on like eight things now,â said Paul.

Calvin asked if Erin wanted to smoke marijuana and she asked if Paul would be okay with that and Paul said yes, thinking he didnât like that she had asked. While Erin and Calvin smoked in the bathroom, with the door closed so Calvinâs parents wouldnât smell it, Paul and Maggie created a GIF of a baseball cap moving around on their heads. Maggie, when Paul said he wanted to smoke marijuana, said he shouldnât because of his lung collapse history. Paul began coughing nonstop after smoking and repeatedly said his chest burned and fell, half deliberately, to the floor, grinning in a stereotypically marijuana-induced manner, he could feel, as he tried, with his MacBook, to find information on the internet about his situation.

âI feel like Iâm unsarcastically viewing this as a major ordeal,â said Calvin.

âIâm just trying to Google âburned lung,â Iâm not doing anything to indicate what you said,â said Paul in an agitated voice while grinning. âIâm just idly looking up âburned lungâ variations on the internet.â

âI was also viewing this as major until Paul just said that,â said Erin.

Paul lay facedown, at some point, on one of the two beds in the room and heard Calvin say âwhat if heâs dead?â and imagined Erin shrugging. When he woke, four hours later, on his side, Erin was holding him from behind.



They spoke onceâat a rest stop, when Paul said it was his turn to drive and Erin said she was okay with continuingâduring the eight-hour drive to Brooklyn, arriving around midnight and sleeping until late in the afternoon, when Erin said she was buying groceries from LifeThyme and driving back to Baltimore. Paul asked if she wanted to âstay and eat dinner on Xanaxâ before leaving.

At Sel De Mer, that night, Erin said Paul had been ignoring her all weekend and that she felt depressed. Paul said heâd focused on doing what he wanted, on talking to Charles, instead of complaining that he was unhappy. Erin said Paul did complain, to Charles.

âI donât remembering complaining to him,â said Paul.

âYou said you donât feel happy around me,â said Erin.

âI said I donât feel happy no matter what. I also said I donât feel interested in anyone except you.â

âYou said you felt interested in other girls sexually.â

âThat isnât complaining,â said Paul. âWe talked about a lot of things.â Charles had seemed to be having the same ârelationship problemsâ with his girlfriend as before Mexico and had said he was planning a similar, solitary trip to Asia. Paul had suggested Charles write a novel called Mexico, plotted around his problems with Jehan, who was still in Mexico but had been active on the internet, regularly writing on Charlesâ Facebook wall and, unless it had been a different Jehan, adding Paul on Goodreads.

After dinner, in Paulâs room, Erin asked if she was âgoing home now.â Paul lay unresponsive on his mattress facing away. Erin said she âwanted to buy groceries from LifeThyme before leaving.â Paul rolled onto his back and, with only the top half of his head visible, said âI think it would be better if you didnât stay tonightâ through the muzzle-y screen of his blanket. He felt âcompletely motionless,â he thought, on his mattress, with his eyes closed, as Erin gathered her belongings. He heard her say âI agree with what you said about how if it doesnât work out then it doesnât work out, but I wanted to say that I like knowing you and I hope it works out.â

Without knowing exactly why, but sensing, on some level, that his feeling was mostly vicariousâthat he was experiencing what he suspected Erin would experience, in a few seconds, once she discerned his sincere lack of responseâPaul felt a sympathetically cringing sensation that he wished Erin hadnât said what she had said. Mechanically, with the lightness of bones that could move, he stood and hugged her briefly, without looking at her face.



Six hours later, when birds were chirping but it was still dark outside, Paul was sitting on his mattress watching what heâd recorded in Calvinâs room. He noticed that he hadnât been in Calvinâs roomâhe didnât remember where heâd gone, maybe downstairs to the kitchenâfor a few minutes, during which Erin had spoken in a louder, more confident voice and openly debated if she wanted a beer. Maggie, Paul saw in the movie, had asked Erin if Paul drank alcohol and Erin had said âsometimes,â then Maggie had asked what kind and Erin had said âbeer, and sometimes tequila,â in a subtly, complicatedly different voice like that of a shyer, less friendly version of herself. Hearing this, aware that Erin would normally attribute non-firsthand information, that sheâd say she had read about him drinking tequila, Paul began crying a little.

He lay against a pile of blankets and pillows, away from his MacBook, unsure why he felt emotional. Gradually he realized heâd intuited her voice sounded different because she had probably assumed, to some degree, that only she knewâand only she would ever knowâof the aberration in her behavior and, while saying âbeer, and sometimes tequila,â maybe had distractedly felt an uncommon nearness to herself that Paul, knowing this in secret from her, had also felt.



Two months later, in mid-July, around a week after Paul turned 28, Calvin and Maggie were in Brooklyn for five days to act in a low-budget movie. They were no longer in a relationship. They met Paul and Erin on a Friday night at Sel De Mer, where Erin gave everyone Xanax and Calvin shared a marijuana cookie with everyone and Maggie, who hadnât eaten meat in two years, ordered lobster. They confirmed to snort heroin in Paulâs room after dinner, then go to the Union Square theater to âgroup livetweetâ whatever movie fit their schedule. They would sit separately during the movie and communicate only through tweets, in service of making the experience âmore fun and interesting,â said Paul, who anticipated wanting to be alone in the theater.

At Paulâs apartment Maggie volunteered to help Paul juice fennel, celery, cucumber, lemon while Erin showered and Calvin did something in Paulâs room. Paul, who had been silent most of the night, partly because he and Erin ingested 2mg Xanax each before dinner, asked if Maggie had asked her brother about âthe thing,â which he was surprised he remembered.

âShit. Yeah. I forgot to tell you.â

âWhat did he say?â

âI donât remember,â said Maggie absently.

âAre you depressed about you and Calvin?â

âYeah. I donât want to talk to him. I feel really depressed.â

Paul organized three bags of heroin into four different-size pilesâMaggie only wanted a littleâwhile Erin bought tickets for X-Men: First Class at 12:35 a.m. Paul drew lines connecting three names to three lines of heroin and heard Calvin say âI think I just figured out I can be happy no matter what people around me are doingâ to what seemed to be himself and earnestly thought âfunnyâ in a monotone with a neutral expression, then snorted his heroin and showered and ingested 15mg Adderall, two Advil, half a marijuana cookie. Paul vomited on the street twice before they got in a taxi with Erin in the front passenger seat and Maggie in the backseat between Paul and Calvin, who was commenting on the taxiâs TV, which was talking about Shaquille OâNeal.

âYou should tweet it, stop talking about it,â said Paul, and opened his door at a red light to vomit, but didnât and received from someone a plastic bag, which he vomited in twice with an overall sensation of disconcern-based serenity. He tweeted âin cab to theater, âalreadyâ vomited twice (jk re seeming to imply xmen will make me vomit)â and read a tweet that said âput hand through cab glass to pet Paul as he vomited into a bag, cabdriver looked at me in a sitcom-like wayâ and said âErin, you forgot the hashtagâ while staring at his own tweet. âI forgot the hashtag also. Weâre all just going to keep forgetting it. Whatâre we going to do?â

âI recommend copy and pasting.â said Erin.

âWeâre all just going to keep forgetting it,â said Paul âpessimistically,â he thought, and when he exited the taxi he walked into, instead of onto, the sidewalk and fell stumbling ahead in an uninhibited, loosely controlled, briefly uncontrolled manner reminiscent of childhood, when this partial to complete abandonment of body and/or limb (of rolling like a log on carpet, falling face-first onto beds, being dragged by an arm or both legs through houses or side yard, floating in swimming pools, lying upside down in headstands on sofas) was normal, allowing his unexpected momentum to naturally expend, falling horizontally for an amusingly far length. He imagined continuing forward in a pretending of momentum, transitioning into a jog, disappearing into the distance. He vomited on the street, then turned around and jogged to Maggie, who stood motionless with a preoccupied expression.

âIâm okay,â said Paul. âWhere are they? Calvin, Erin.â

âBuying water,â said Maggie.

âHow do you feel?â

âFloaty,â said Maggie with a neutral expression. âGood. How do you feel?â

âGood,â said Paul smiling. âI just used too much.â



When they entered the theater the movie had already begun. Paul sat in a stadium-seated area, above and behind everyone else in the front area. After a few minutes he went to Maggie, who was in an isolated seat, on the right side of the theater. Maggie pointed at Erin and Calvin, twenty feet away, talking to each other.

âWe agreed to sit separately,â said Maggie.

âI want separately also,â said Paul.

âI feel upset,â said Maggie.

âIâm going to see whatâs happening,â said Paul, and crossed an aisle, past five empty seats, to Erin, as Calvin left the theater. Erin said Calvin had wanted to share her phone. Paul said Calvin âshould just go charge it for like ten minutes.â

âI know. Thatâs what I said. Heâs doing that now.â

âCalvin went to charge his phone,â said Paul to Maggie, and returned to his seat. He tweeted âsomeone in my row is snoring #xmenlivetweetâ and âkevin bacon had something like 10 hands #xmenlivetweet.â Maggie tweeted she wanted more heroin. Paul tweeted âi can hear someone snoring ~8 seats to my left #xmenlivetweetâ and saw Maggie leave the theater and stared absently as Kevin Bacon talked to people. Kevin Bacon walked outside, where it was snowing, then he turned around and talked to the same people as before, who had followed him. Paul tried to remember why Kevin Bacon had gone outside. He read tweets from Maggie that said âfeeling lonely #xmenlivetweetâ and âi am in the bathroom contemplating chugging my beer,â which had no hashtag. Paul saw that Erin had left the theater. Paul cautiously entered the womenâs bathroom, a few minutes later, hearing Maggieâs voice and movement noises from the handicapped stall.

âExcuse me, maâam,â said Paul in a loud, authoritative voice, and the movement noises stopped.

âYes?â said Erin after a pause.

âItâs me,â said Paul.

âOh, shit,â said Maggie, and the door opened.

âI was scared,â said Erin, partly in view.

âYouâre in the womenâs bathroom,â said Maggie.

âSorry,â said Paul grinning, and left and sat on the carpeted floor near an emergency exit and tweeted âwhere is everyone . . . iâm sitting in darkness near the womenâs bathroom #xmenlivetweetâ and that he was going to try to scare Erin and Maggie again. He read âjust stood up, lost âall controlâ of left leg and fell into an arcade game, making a loud noise and âyelpingâ #xmenlivetweetâ by Calvin. He read âsomeone just said âwe did it!â while seeming to float in an indoor âfuture areaâ #xmenlivetweetâ by Erin. He heard Maggieâs voice and walked quickly to her and Erin and thrust his glass bottle of water at them but water didnât leave the bottle until, as the bottle neared himself, some splashed onto his chin and neck. Calvin was sitting on the floor by the candy machines, smiling calmly at his phone. Erin gave Paul and Maggie tea-tree toothpicks. Paul went in the theater to his seat and tweeted âwhy is âbeastâ flying a jet plane . . . #xmenlivetweetâ and âis this world war 2, i donât understand anything #xmenlivetweetâ and âiâm going to stand to look at who has been snoring loudly for ~15 min. #xmenlivetweetâ and âsomeone seems to be laying across 2 seats sleeping #xmenlivetweet.â He became aware of the tea-tree toothpickâs wiggling, outside his mouth, and of his intensely concentrating expression, as he worked on editing a tweet, a few minutes after credits had begun scrolling down the screen, when the white shape, of Erin in a white dress, in Paulâs peripheral vision, stopped enlarging, indicating an arrival.



In the lobby, by the bathrooms, Paul said he felt nauseated. âI feel,â said Erin, and was quiet for around five seconds. âNever mind.â Paul asked carefully, with vague aversion toward himself, if she usually thought of what to say before speaking, or would start talking without thinking. âI think at least fifty percent of it before talking, I think,â said Erin. âWhy?â

Paul said it was annoying sometimes to wait for her to think, and they stopped talkingâCalvin and Maggie were ahead, sometimes looking backâuntil they got on the L train, when Paul apologized for saying it was annoying and said he understood her behavior. Erin quietly said it was okay. Paul asked if she felt okay and she said she did, and asked if Paul did. Maggie jumped in front of them and posed with the sleeping, drooling, middle-aged man in an opposite seat. âIâm okay with everything,â said Paul distractedly, with some confusion, after moving his iPhone into position and photographing only the middle-aged man because Maggie had returned to her seat.

âAre you sure?â said Erin.

âYeah. Iâm okay with everything if you are.â

âI am,â said Erin.

âI feel nauseated,â said Paul a few minutes later. âBut Iâm okay with everything. If Iâm not talking itâs because Iâm nauseated.â

âOkay,â said Erin. âThank you for telling me.â



In the large deli below Harryâs apartment Paul walked away, at one point, from everyone else and, alone in an aisle, turned into a barrier-like display of heavily discounted tomato sauce. None fell, or seemed to have been disturbed, or affected, to any degree, and no one saw. After buying beer, fennel, celery, a plastic bag of apples, three lemons and walking six blocks Paul and Erin sat on a sidewalk waiting for Calvin and Maggie to get their sleeping bags from where theyâd been staying.

âYouâre really quiet suddenly,â said Erin.

âIâm really nauseated,â said Paul, and rested the weight of his head facedown on his open palms, covering his eyes and cheeks and forehead. It began raining lightly, in a mist, as if onto produce, or probably an air conditioner was dripping condensation. Paul weakly tried to remember what month it was, stopping after a few seconds, and moved his shoulders to indicate he didnât want to be touched when Erin began rubbing his back.



Maggie was in the bathroom and Paul was sitting cross-legged on his mattress, around half an hour later, absently reading descriptions of mutants on X-Men: First Classâs Wikipedia pageââscientist who is transformed into a frightening-looking mutant in an effort to cure himself, but is kind at heartââwhen Calvin asked if âanyoneâ wanted to sit with him on the front stoop while he smoked.

âMe. I will,â said Erin, who had been drying her hair with a towel after showering, and Paul saw her looking at herself in the wall mirror. He clicked âKevin Baconâ and looked at the words âKevin Bacon (disambiguation)â without thinking anything for a vague amount of time, until Maggie entered the room, when he stood and went in the bathroom and heard Erin say âactually, Iâll have a beerâ and Calvin say âreally?â and âcool.â The thick carpet of the bathmat, folded like a soft taco, was in the bathtub, sopping and heavy. Paul thought with some confusion that Maggie mustâve put it there, maybe for slippage prevention. While showering he thought about what heâd done during the filming, last year, August to December, of X-Men: First Class: hid in his room, gone on a book tour, gotten married, visited his parents. He entered his room wearing boxer shortsâMaggie was sitting in a far corner looking at her MacBook with a serious expressionâand turned around and put on a shirt, sat on his mattress, placed his MacBook on his lap, stared at the words âBacon in 2007â with slightly unfocused eyes. Maggie said she had a stomachache and moved onto the mattress asking if Paul wanted beer, which she held toward him and which he mutely held a few seconds before moving it near Maggie, who drank some and put it on the floor and resettled herself on the mattress with the sides of their knees touching.

âCalvin and Erin have been gone so long,â said Paul.

âMaybe theyâre watching the sunrise,â said Maggie.

âI donât think you can see it from here.â

âMaybe they went somewhere.â

âI donât think you can see it from anywhere near here.â

âI donât know where they are,â said Maggie.

âDo you feel depressed still?â

âYeah,â said Maggie.

âBecause of you and Calvin?â

âYeah.â

âDid you end the relationship or him?â

âIt was me,â said Maggie. âHe didnât want it to end.â She said she felt depressed because sheâd been really close with Calvin, so now something in her life felt missing. Paul asked about the singer, of a punk band he listened to often in high school, who had kissed Maggie, sheâd said in an email, in someoneâs car after a concert. Maggie said the singer didnât want to bring her in his hotel room because his friends would think it was weird she was 17 and that he wanted to perform oral sex on her but she didnât want that and heâd said they could âget naked but not have sexâ and Maggie had said she didnât know what that meant. Then the singer had told intimate secrets about his ex-girlfriend. Paul had idly opened iMovie on his MacBook and theyâd been absently looking at it, not recording, as they talked and he accidentally clickedâand quickly closedâone of the movies.

âThat might be porn. Erin and I made a porn.â

âWhatâs that?â said Maggie pointing at âketamine.â

âA drug we used before going to Urban Outfitters.â

âIt seems like you and Erin have a lot of fun together. Is that true?â

Paul said they saw each other once every ten days and usually started âfightingâ after one or two days. Maggie asked what they fought about. Paul vaguely remembered when, on a large dose of Xanax, alone one night in his room, he fell on his way to his mattress to sleepâpulling down his high chair and causing his shoulder, he discovered upon waking eleven hours later, to bleed heavily from two places into a dark pile on his mattressâonly slightly aware that this was unrelated to Maggieâs question. Paul remembered when he calculated three divided by two as three-fourths regarding an amount of heroin and vomited steadily eight to ten hours, beginning around noon. He and Erin, whoâd been resilient, maybe from weeks of Percocet after her car accident, had snorted the miscalculated heroin upon waking and, after riding the L train, heâd begun vomitingânear Union Square on streets and sidewalks, in Pure Food and Wineâs bathroom, while walking thirteen blocks south, in Bobst Libraryâs bathrooms. When they left the library at night he stopped every ten to fifteen feet to vomit nothing and Erin began expressing a previously suppressed concern, insisting Paul drink water. Paul vomited repeatedly after each sip and satâand, at one point, briefly, layâon the sidewalk outside a New York University dorm by Washington Square Park, inaudibly mumbling that he was okay and, when Erin said she wanted to call an ambulance, barely perceptibly shaking his head no with a sensation of reluctantly imparting an ancient wisdom. In his room, an hour later, around 9:30 p.m., Erin wanted Paul, covered by his blanket on his mattress, to drink a glass of water and didnât think he should be lying with eyes closed because people in his situation died by sleeping. After an increasingly tense exchange culminating with Paul âsarcastically,â he thought, chugging the large glass of waterâin a display of functioning that probably seemed unlike that of a dying personâErin, to some degree spitefully, Paul felt, had said she was driving home to Baltimore and, to Paulâs surprise, had left him to sleep alone.

âJust . . . things,â said Paul, and laughed a little.

Maggie was staring at his MacBookâs screen.

âDifferent things,â said Paul.

âIâm just curious,â said Maggie in a frustrated voice.

âI know,â said Paul staring at the cursor on the screen, repeatedly disappearing and reappearing in the same place.

âCan I watch some of a movie?â

âYeah,â said Paul. âWhich one?â

âYour favorite one. Not the porn.â

Paul clicked a ninety-two-minute movie beginning in his parentsâ apartment, when he and Erin had returned for ecstasy because heâd vomited his MDMA. Paulâs mother was talking about the Flip cam sheâd bought for Paulâs birthday. Paul clicked near the end of the movie. Erin was describing, in âthe voice,â which they hadnât used in months, how salmonella was harvested, in the residential area behind McDonaldâs. In the movie Paul said something inaudible and Erin said âAndroid? Youâre bringing Android into this? Amateur.â Paul clicked elsewhere and the movie showed solid black as Erin said âand here we have the brainchild, really, of this whole operation.â When Paul described his time in Taiwan as âhellish,â a month or two ago, Erin had been surprised, because sheâd enjoyed Taiwan, which had surprised Paul, who had cited âoverdriveâ and their excessive drug use before the trip as why it had, for him, been âhellish.â Descending to McDonaldâs first floor, in the movie, Erin looked different than she did now, Paul thought, and for maybe the eighth time in the past month considered that she had subtly denser bones or unseen scar tissue now that her face had fully healed. Paul stopped the movie and the vanished image, of Erin and the Christmas tree, reappeared instantly in his memory, looking similar, being already memory-like, on the screen, from low resolution. Taipei seemed gothic and lunar, in the movies of that night, with the spare activity and structural density of a fully colonized moon that had been abandoned and was being recolonized; its science-fictional qualities seemed less advanced than ancient, haunted, of a future dark age.

Maggie was showing Paul emails from the punk singer, after showing him writing sheâd emailed to a magazine, when Erin and Calvin returned. Calvin asked what they were looking at and Maggie, closing her MacBook, said she was showing Paul writing sheâd emailed to a magazine.

âYou guys are still awake?â said Erin. âWhat have you guys been doing?â

âWhat were you guys doing?â said Paul in a quiet monotone, mentally stressing âyou.â Erin went in the bathroom and Paul heard the sink turn on and, when she exited, asked if she had smoked cigarettes. She said Calvin had but she hadnât. Paul removed his contact lenses and washed his face, and said he was going to sleep and lay facing away from Erin, who asked if heâd set his alarm. Paul said heâd set it for 2:30 p.m. (theyâd agreed to be extras, in the movie Calvin and Maggie were in, tomorrow at 4:30 p.m.) and Erin asked if he was upset about something.

âNo, I want to sleep. Iâm putting earplugs in.â

âIf youâre upset, tell me now instead of later.â

âI want to sleep,â said Paul.

âYou seem upset. Can you tell me why?â

Calvin and Maggie were unrolling their sleeping bags. Paul turned toward Erin, whose expression he couldnât see without contact lenses, and loudly whispered âI feel upset you went outside for so long without talking to me first and that you kept asking me if I was okay when I told you I felt nauseated and that you keep asking me if Iâm upset after I said I wasnâtâ and turned away.

âSo you are upset,â said Erin after a few seconds.

âIâm nauseated and want to sleep. Iâm putting in earplugs.â

Erin put an arm around him, and he stood and turned off the roomâs light and lay facing away. After a few minutes Erin squished an arm under his neck, wrapping it around his chest to hug him tightly with both arms. Paul thought of the monk-fish heâd shown herâthe light-absorbing mass of it, a silhouette of itself, Wikipediaâs stock image for monkfishâand felt emotional, and committed to not moving, then woke to his alarm. He kept his eyes closed, feigning sleep. He could faintly hear Maggie saying his name. âPaul, your alarm,â said Maggie louder, and touched his arm.

He turned off the alarm and covered his head with his blanket, feeling tense and uncomfortable. He removed his earplugs, went in the bathroom, showered and moved quickly to his MacBook and looked at the internet sitting cross-legged on his bed, facing away from Erin, who was waking, it seemed. Paul could feel his left eyebrow twitching. Erin, after a few minutes, sat and said âhas everyone showered?â in a voice that sounded loud and sleepy, as if contented. Paul, who felt an excruciating dread of being spoken to or looked at, was startled by how Erin was calmly, unself-consciously, nonchalantly directing attention toward herself. Paul emailed Erin while she showered and, after she blow-dried her hair, Calvin and Maggie left, saying theyâd see Paul and Erin in an hour. Erin sat at the foot of the bed, facing away from Paul who lay on his back with his MacBook against his thighs, and they communicated by email (theyâd agreed to type, not talk, whenever one of them, currently Paul, felt unable to speak in a friendly tone) for around fifty minutes, until Erin said âit seems like you donât care about meâ aloud.

âI donât,â said Paul. âI donât right now.â

âIt seems that way.â

âI know. I donât care right now.â

They were quiet a few seconds.

âIâm going to Think Coffee,â said Erin, and went in the bathroom, then back in Paulâs room, then into the kitchen and out of the apartment. Paul slept three hours, then texted âhowâs Think Coffee.â Erin responded sheâd been wandering aimlessly on Xanax and hadnât gotten there yet. Paul rode the L train to Union Square and walked toward the library, ten blocks south, to meet Erin for dinner, beneath a membranous and vaguely patterned sky like a faded, inconsistently worn red-and-blue blanket lit from the other side.

If it were a blanket, Paul thought, beneath which existed only his imagination, he wouldnât want to throw it off and be obliterated by the brightness of a childâs bedroom in daytime, or even peek outside, letting in the substrate of another world. Realizing this, as a medium dose of Xanax began taking effect, he felt a kind of safety in being where he wasâinside the confines of what, to him, was everythingâinstead of âout there.â



In Paulâs room, around 3:30 a.m., after ordering a lot of food at Lodge but eating only a little and talking calmly, then working on things a few hours on Adderall, they decided to eat psilocybin mushrooms Paul had bought a few weeks ago from Peanut. The light was off and they were on Paulâs mattress, forty minutes later, when Paul began asking what Erin, who seemed reluctant to answer, was thinking. She stood and turned on the light and asked where the âbagâ of mushrooms was and, because she thought she was feeling it more than Paul, fed him the remaining amount and turned off the light.

âWeâre choosing to not talk, which itself is a communication, which seems good,â thought Paul holding Erin. âIâll continue communicating in this manner, by not.â His steady, controlled petting of one of Erinâs vertebra with the cuticle of his right index finger gradually felt like his only method of remaining in concrete reality, where he and Erin, and other people, shared a world. Sometimes, forgetting what he was doing, his finger would slow or stop and he would become aware of a drifting sensation and realize he was being absorbedâfrom an indiscernible distance, beyond which he wouldnât know how to returnâand, with some urgency, move his body or open his eyes, seeing grid-like overlays on the walls and holograms of graph paper in the air, to interrupt his being taken. The effort became gradually smaller and more unconscious and, as if for something to do, in place of what was now automatic, Paul began to discern his rhythmic petting as a continuous striving to elicit certain information from Erin by responding or not responding to her rhythms, in a cycle whose goal was to produce momentary equilibriums. He felt increasingly attuned to the speed and quality of her breathing and heart rate, until he felt able to instantly discern changes in her physiology, which in entirety began to seem like an inconstant unit of unique, irreducible information (an ever-changing display of only prime numbers) that was continuously expressed and that bypassed the parts of them that allowed for deliberation or perception or intuition, beginning and ending in the only place where they were exactly together, undifferentiated and unknowable, but couldnât, in their present form, ever reach, like a thing communicating directly with itself, rendering them both irrelevant.

Paul began to sometimes laugh uncontrollably, with his face at the back of Erinâs neck, unsure what was funny. When he saw her frowning, a few minutes later, she burrowed her head against his chest and he said âwhat are you thinking about?â and she didnât answer and, in an increasingly incredulous voice, like he mostly wanted to express how amazingly difficult it was to knowâsometimes pausing after each word for emphasisâhe repeatedly stated the question. âThis isnât what I expected at all,â he heard himself say, at some point, without knowing what he was referencing. Heâd obviously wanted something good to happen, but what was happening wasnât expected, based on what heâd said, therefore it must be bad. He was yawning, so was factually bored of Erin. âI feel like I canât breathe,â he said, and suddenly stood and felt confused and unreal. He repeatedly fell onto his mattress, which every time seemed much less substantial than expected, dropping his body with increasing force and desperation, then lay on his back, unsatisfied and worried. âSleeping, waking,â he said frustratedly. âIs there a difference? Am I dead?â

âYouâre not dead,â said Erin.

âI think Iâm dead,â said Paul distractedly, and covered his face with a blanket. He was thinking of how people say that when you die you experience your last moments for an eternity, when Erin yanked away the blanket and began tickling him and pulling him from the mattress as he giggled and intensely struggled, with confusion and frustration, to hide beneath the blanket. After succeeding, facedown with Erin sitting on his back, he seemed, while hidden, to not be thinking anything, then when he absently shifted to expose his face, to breathe, he believed he was insane. He asked if he was and Erin said no, which proved he was, because if he were he would ask and Erin would say he was not. He would never be sane, now that he was insane, he knew, then moved directly past that conclusionâunable to stop there, or anywhereâand believed again that he was dead and remembered hearing the word âbagâ and thought of heroin and said âdid we overdose?â He realized he would be alone if he was dead, even if Erin had also diedâdeath would seal them into their own private afterlivesâand, in idle correction, quietly said âdid I overdose?â

âI just have to deal with it,â he said in reference to being permanently alone, with only his weak projections of Erin and his roomârequiring an amount of effort to sustain that was immense and debilitating, which was probably why, he realized, he couldnât sate his breath, feel comfortable, think coherentlyâto occupy himself forever. âItâs okay,â he said, to begin some process of consolation, but felt only more despair and a panicked suspicion that heâd barely comprehended the terribleness of his situation. âThis will go on for twenty years,â he said vaguely, and stood and slapped his thighs with both hands, then held the bathroom doorâs frame with his arms in a V and his head hung down and repeatedly said âoh my godâ while thinking âI canât believe I ODâdâ and failing to view his deathâthe horrible, inexcusable mistake of itâas interestingly absurd or blackly comic or anything except profoundly troubling. He fell facedown on a mound of blankets and pillows and rolled onto his back, suddenly contemplative. âI donât remember that at all,â he said of the months, or years, when their drug use increased and they began injecting heroin, crudely visualizing a stereotypical montage of downward-spiraling drug use. âI donât remember . . . that. But it must have happened . . . I just canât believe I overdosed.â

âYou canât overdose on mushrooms,â said Erin meekly.

âI forgot we used mushrooms,â said Paul in a curious voice, but didnât consider the information and immediately forgot again. âI think I am where you were twenty minutes ago, so you need to console me,â he said while thinking âthatâs exactly what I would tell a projection to do if I were dead.â He tried to fondly recall a memory of his life, of life generallyâhe would need to learn to be satisfied with his memories, which was all he had nowâand said âkissing is goodâ and âremember Las Vegas?â He said âTaiwan was goodâ knowing it hadnât been, aware he was openly trying to deceive himself, then thought of tracing back his life to determine what caused the sequence of events leading to his overdose. âThe book tour . . . after the summer. Two trips to Taiwan. Remember Arbyâs? In Florida?â He heard Erin say they never went to Florida and realized he was talking to himself while sustaining an imaginary companion and that he wasnât saying what he was thinking. âWhy do I keep thinking about RBIs, runs batted in? And something about Hank Aaron?â Paul believed again, at some point, that he was in the prolonged seconds before death, in which he had the opportunity to return to lifeâby discerning some code or pattern of connections in his memory, or remembering some of what had happened with a degree of chronology sufficient to re-enter the shape of his life, or sustaining a certain variety of memories in his consciousness long enough to be noticed as living and relocated accordingly. Lying on his back, on his mattress, he uncertainly thought heâd written books to tell people how to reach him, to describe the particular geography of the area of otherworld in which heâd been secluded.



Paul was on his back on his mattress thinking âfaces are circles,â and of cutting a face into four parts, as his room slowly brightened with indirect sunlight. Erin held his hand and he stood and went with her to the window and focused on the metaphysical area where he anticipated hearing her voice, wanting to be surprised, or to hear something consolingâapportioned from himself to his projection, to ventriloquize back to himselfâabout death. Erin was pointing at the sky, asking if Paul saw âthat thingââa pale, logo-like silhouette of antennae, or leafless plant, rising from a sixth-floor roof âs corner, foregrounding a pink sky. Paul said he did, and that it looked pretty, he felt like a sleepy child willingly distracted from worries about a lost pet by a mother pointing at a star saying âeverything will be okay, just focus on the twinklingâthatâs where we came from and where weâll be again, no matter what happens here, yes, I promise.â

He held Erinâs hand and wandered somewhat aimlessly into the bathroom and picked up a tongue scraper. âYou bought me this,â he said with dull, unfocused eyes. âI never used it. But I really appreciated it. I liked getting it. I never told you.â He put it down and disinterestedly thought âitâs not going to work,â as his hand idly turned a knob, and was surprised by the rupture and crackling of water, its instantaneous column of binary variations. He moved his hand into the water and was surprised again. âI didnât expect that . . . to feel like that,â he said with a serious expression. âThatâs really weird.â Realizing he had no concept of what water felt like until he touched itâcold, grasping, meticulous, awareâhe felt self-conscious and said he wanted to pee alone. Sitting on the toilet, with the door closed, Paul realized he felt less discomfort and could breathe easier and that the surface of things was shinier and more dimensional from greater pixilation, all of which he viewed as evidence he was successfully convincing himselfâthrough an increasingly elaborate, skillful, unconscious projection of a reality he would eventually believe he was exploringâthat he wasnât dead. With an eternity to practice, he realized, he would forget everything he had thought or felt while dead, including his current thoughts and feelings; he would only believe, as he once had, that he was alive.

He was startled, entering his room, to see Erin already moving, as if independent of his perception. He briefly discerned her movement as incrementalânot continuous, but in frames per secondâand, like with insects or large predators, unpredictable and dangerous. He wanted to move backward and close the door and be alone again, in the bathroom, but Erin had already noticed him and, after a pause, distracted by her attention, he reciprocated her approach. They hugged a little, near the center of the room, then he turned around and moved toward the kitchenâdimly aware of the existence of other places, on Earth, where he could goâand was surprised when he heard himself, looking at his feet stepping into black sandals, say that he felt âgrateful to be alive.â

The Hermeneutics of Screwing Around; or What You Do with a Million Books
Stephen Ramsay April 17, 2010
According to the World Wide Web, the phrase, "So many books, so little time" originates with Frank Zappa. I don't believe it, myself. If I had had to guess, I would have said maybe Erasmus or Trithemius. But even if I'm right, I'm probably wrong. This is one of civilization's oldest laments--one that (in spirit, at least) predates the book itself. There has never been a time when philosophers--lovers of wisdom broadly understood--have not exhibited profound regret over the impedance mismatch between time and truth. For surely, there are more books, more ideas, more experiences, more relationships worth having than there are hours in a day (or days in a lifetime). What everyone wants--what everyone from Sargon to Zappa has wanted-- is some coherent, authoritative path through what is known. That's the idea behind Dr. Elliot's Five Foot Shelf, Adler's Great Books of the Western World, Modern Library's 100 Best Books, and all other similar attempts to condense knowledge into some ordered list of things the educated should know. It's also the idea behind every syllabus, every curriculum, and most of the non-fiction books that have ever been written. The world is vast. Art is long. What else can we do but survey the field, introduce a topic, plant a seed (with, what else, a seminar). Amazon.com has a feature that allows users to create reading guides focused on a particular topic. They call it, appropriately, "Listmania." While the anxiety of not knowing the path is constant, moments of cultural modernity provide especially fertile ground for the creation of epitomes, summae, canons, and bibles (as well as new schools, new curricula, and new ways of organizing knowledge). It is, after all, at the end of history that one undertakes summation of "the best that has been thought and said in 1

the world" (190). The aforementioned "great books" lists all belong to the early decades of the twentieth century, when U.S. cultural anxiety--especially concerning its relationship to Europe--could be leavened with a bold act of cultural confidence. Thomas Jefferson had said something similar at a time closer to the founding of the country, when he noted that "All that is necessary for a student is access to a library, and directions in what order the books are to be read." But the same phenomenon--the same play of anxiety and confidence--was at work in the writing of the Torah, the Summa, Will Durant's Story of Civilization, and all efforts of similar grandeur. All three of those works were written during moments, not just of rapid cultural change, but during periods of anxiety about change. "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them" (Deutronomy 5:1); "[W]e purpose in this book to treat of whatever belongs to the Christian religion, in such a way as may tend to the instruction of beginners" (1); "I wish to tell as much as I can, in as little space as I can, of the contributions that genius and labor have made to the cultural heritage of mankind" (?) This essay will not aim quite so high. Even in the very early days of the Web, one felt the soul-crushing lack of order. One of the first pages I ever visited was "David and Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web," which endeavored to, what else, guide you through what seemed an already impossibly vast expanse of information (you may have heard of that particular compendium; it's now called Yahoo!). Google might seem something else entirely, but it shares the basic premise of those quaint guides of yore, and of all guides to knowledge. The point is not to return the over three million pages that relate in some way to Frank Zappa. The point is to say, "Relax. Here is where you start. Look at this. Then look at that." We might say that all such systems rely on an act of faith, but it's not so much trust in the search engine (or the book, or the professor) as it is willingness to suspend disbelief about the yellow wood after having taken a particular road. Literary historian Franco Moretti states the situation starkly: [W]e've just started rediscovering what Margaret Cohen calls the "great unread." "I work on West European narrative, etc. . . ." Not really, I work on its canonical fraction, which is not even one per cent of published literature. And again, some people 2

have read more, but the point is that there are thirty thousand nineteenth-century British novels out there, forty, fifty, sixty thousand--no one really knows, no one has read them, no one ever will. And then there are French novels, Chinese, Argentinian, American . . . (55) Debates about "canonicity" have been raging in my field for as long as the field has been around. Who's in? Who's out? How do we decide? Moretti reminds us of the dispiriting fact that this problem has no practical solution. It's not just that someone or something will be left off; it's that our most inclusive, most enlightened choices will fail against even the most generous requirements for statistical significance. The syllabus represents the merest fraction of the professor's knowledge, and the professor's knowledge is embarrassingly slight. It's not that the emperor has no clothes (that would be fine); it's that no one knows what the emperor looks like. Greg Crane, who held a series of symposia on the general question, "What Do You Do With A Million Books?" a few years ago, rightly identifies it as an ancient calculus: The Greek historian Herodotus has the Athenian sage Solon estimate the lifetime of a human being at c. 26,250 days (Herodotus, The Histories, 1.32). If we could read a book on each of those days, it would take almost forty lifetimes to work through every volume in a single million book library. The continuous tradition of written European literature that began with the Iliad and Odyssey in the eighth century BCE is itself little more than a million days old. While libraries that contain more than one million items are not unusual, print libraries never possessed a million books of use to any one reader. Way too many books, way too little time. But again, the real anxiety is not that the Library of Congress contains over 500 human lifetimes worth of reading material (I'm using the highly generous Solon-Crane metric, which assumes you read a book every day from the day you're born until the day you die). The problem is that that much information probably exceeds our ability create reliable guides to it. It's one thing to worry that your canon isn't sufficiently inclusive, or broad, or representative. It's another thing when your canon has no better chance 3

of being these things than a random selection. When we get up into the fourteen-million-book range, books that are known by more than two living people are already "popular." A book like Hamlet has overcome enormous mathematical odds that ruthlessly favor obscurity; the fact that millions of people have read it might become a compelling argument for why you should read it too. But in the end, arguments from the standpoint of popularity satisfy neither the canoniclast nor the historian. The dark fear is that no one can really say what is "representative," because no one has any basis for making such a claim. Several solutions have been proposed, including proud ownership of our ignorance and dilletantism. A few years ago, Pierre Bayard famously--and with only the barest sheen of satire--exposed our condition by writing a book entitled, "How To Talk About Books You Haven't Read?" In it, intellectual facility is presented as a kind of trick. "For knowing how to speak with finesse about something with which we are unacquainted has value far beyond the realm of books" (184). It is a lesson thoroughly absorbed by anyone who stands on the right side of a Ph.D. oral exam. But amazingly, even Bayard sees this as a means toward guiding people through knowledge. [Students] see culture as a huge wall, as a terrifying specter of "knowledge." But we intellectuals, who are avid readers, know there are many ways of reading a book. You can skim it, you can start and not finish it, you can look at the index. You learn to live with a book. [. . . ] I want to help people organize their own paths through culture. ("Read It?") At some level, there is no difference at all between Pierre Bayard and, say, Mortimer Adler. Both believe in culture. Both believe that one can find an ordered path through culture. Bayard just thinks there are faster ways to do it than starting with Volume 1 of Great Books of the Western World. Indeed, Adler himself almost seems to agree; books two and three of Great Books present what he calls a "Synopticon." What could such a thing be but the Cliff 's Notes to the main ideas of Western civilization? There also isn't much of a difference between Bayard on the one hand and Crane and Moretti on the other. All three would like us to dispense with the silly notion that we can read everything, so that we can get on with the task of organizing our own paths through culture. It is true that the latter--as well as Digital Humanists generally--propose that we use computers, but I would like to argue that that difference is not as crucial as it seems. 4

There have always been two ways to deal with a library. The first is the one we're most used to thinking about. I am doing research on the influence of French composer Edgard Var` ese on the early work of Frank Zappa. I go to the library and conduct an investigation, that might include the card catalog, a bibliography or two, the good people at the reference desk, or any one of a dozen different methods and tools. This is search. I know what I'm looking for, and I have various strategies for locating it. I can't read everyting on this subject. I can't even locate everything on this subject. But I have faith in the idea that I can walk out of the library (this afternoon, or after ten years of focused research, depending on my situation) being able to speak intelligently and convincingly on this topic. The second way goes like this: I walk into the library and wander around in a state of insoucient boredom. I like music, so I head over to the music section. I pick up a book on American rock music and start flipping through it (because it's purple and big). There's an interesting bit on Frank Zappa, and it mentions that Zappa was way into this guy named Edgard Var` ese. I have no idea who that is, so I start looking around for some Var` ese. One look at the cover of his biography--Var` ese with that mad-scientist look and the crazy hair--and I'm already a fan. And so off I go. I check out some records and discover Var` ese. This is called browsing, and it's a completely different activity. Here, I don't know what I'm looking for, really. I just have a bundle of "interests" and proclivities. I'm not really trying to find "a path through culture." I'm really just screwing around. This is more or less how Zappa discovered Var` ese. He had read an article in LOOK magazine in which the owner of the Sam Goody record chain was bragging about his ability to sell obscure records like The Complete Works of Edgard Var` ese, Vol. 1 (Occhiogrosso 31). The article described Var` ese's music as, "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds." The rest is history (of the sort that you can search for, if you're so inclined). We think of the computer as a device that has revolutionized search-- "information retrieval," to use the formal term--and that is of course true. Until recently, no one was able to search the content of all the books in the library. There was no way to ask, "Which of these books contains the phrase `Frank Zappa?' " The fact that we can now do that changes everything, but it doesn't change the nature of the thing. When we ask that question--or any question, for that matter--we are still searching. We are still asking a question and availing ourselves of various technologies in the pursuit of the 5

answer. Browsing, though, is a different matter. Because once you have programmatic access to the content of the library, screwing around suddenly becomes a far more illuminating and useful activity. That is, after all, why we called the navigational framework one used to poke around the World Wide Web a "browser." From the very start, the Web outstripped our ability to say what is actually there. Dave and Jerry couldn't do it then and Google can't do it even now. "Can I help you?" "No, I'm just browsing." Translation: "I just got here! How can you help me find what I'm looking for when (a) I don't know what's here and (b) I don't what I'm looking for?" The sales clerk, of course, doesn't need a translation. He or she understands perfectly that you're just screwing around. And that is absolutely not what the people who are thinking about the brave new world of large-scale digital corpora (Google Books, or the Web itself) want to talk about. Consider Martin Mueller's notion of "not reading"-- an idea he puts forth during a consideration of the power of the digital surrogate: A book sits in a network of transactions that involve a reader, his interlocutors, and a "collective library" of things one knows or is supposed to know. Felicitous reading--I adapt the term from John Austin's definition of felicitous speech acts--is the art of locating with sufficient precision the place a given book occupies in that network at a given moment. Your skill as a reader, then, is measured by the speed and accuracy with which you can do that. Ideally you should do it in "no time at all." Once you have oriented a book in the right place of its network, you can stop reading. In fact, you should stop reading. (Mueller 9­10). Perhaps this isn't "search," classically understood, but it's about as far from screwing around as the average game theory symposium is from poker night. You go to the archive to set things right--to increase the likelihood that your network of associations corresponds to the actual one (or, as seems more likely, the culturally dominant one). That technology could assist you in this august task--the task of a lifetime for most of us--should not obscure the fundamental conservatism of this vision. The vast digital library is there to help you answer the question with which you began.

Greg Crane imagines a library in which the books talk to each other-- each one embedded in a swirl of data mining and machine learning algorithms. What do we do with a million books? His answer is boldly visionary: "[E]xtract from the stored record of humanity useful information in an actionable format for any given human being of any culture at any time and in any place." He notes that this "will not emerge quickly," but one might legitimately question whether, strictly speaking, such a thing is logically possible for the class of problems traditionally held within the province of screwing around. What "useful information" was Zappa looking for (in, of all places, LOOK)?. He didn't really know and couldn't say. Zappa would have loved the idea of "actionable formats," however. As it turns out, it took him over a year to find a copy of a Var` ese record, and when he finally did, he didn't have the money to buy it. He ended up having to convince the saleman to part with it at a discount. Lucky for us, the salesman's "network of transactions" was flawed. How would Zappa's adventure have played out today? LOOK Online mentions Var` ese, and the "actionable format" is (at best) a click away, and at worst, over at Pirate Bay. And it's better than that. If you like Var` ese, you might also like Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time, which Messiaen actually wrote in a prison camp during the Second World War, the fifth movement of which (the piece, not the war) is based on an earlier piece which uses six Ondes Martinot, which is not only one of the first electronic instruments, but possibly the most beautiful sound you have ever hearde. And I don't believe this. There's a guy in Seattle who is trying to build an Ondes, and he's already rigged a ring controller to a Q125 Signal Processor. And he's got video. This is browsing. And it's not like being in a library at all. Is it possible to imagine this kind of highly serendipitous journey replacing the ordered mannerism of conventional search? It's important here to note that the choice is not between Google and Stumble--between surfing and asking Jeeves. It's not a matter of replacing one with the other, as any librarian will tell you. It is rather to ask whether we are ready to accept surfing and stumbling--screwing around, broadly understood--as a research methodology. For to do so would be to countenance the irrefragable complexities of what "no one really knows." Could we imagine a world in which "Here is an ordered list of the books you should read," gives way to, "Here is what I found. What did you find?" Because that is the conversation I and many other professional scholars and intellectuals are having on Twitter 7

every single day, and it's not clear that we are worse for it. There are concerns, of course. A humanist scholar--of whatever discipline, and however postmodern--is by definition a believer in shared culture. If everyone is screwing around, one might legitimately wonder whether we can achieve a shared experience of culture sufficient to the tasks we've traditionally set for education--especially matters such as participation in the public square. Concerns about a media landscape so ramified as to allow you to listen only to those ideas with which you already agree are not without foundation. But these questions are no sooner asked than answered by the recent history of the World Wide Web. Today, the dominant format of the Web is not the "Web page," but the protean, modded forum: Slashdot, Reddit, Digg, Boing Boing, and countless others. They are guides of a sort, but they describe themselves vaguely as containing "stuff that matters," or, "a directory of wonderful things." These sites are at once the product of screwing around and the social network that invariable results when people screw with each other. As usual, they order these things much better in France. Years ago Roland Barthes made the provocative distinction between the "readerly text" (where one is mostly a passive consumer), and the "writerly text," where, as he put it, the reader, "before the infinite play of the world (the world as function) is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages." Many have commented on the ways such thoughts appear to anticipate the hypertext, the mashup, and the Web. But Barthes himself doubted whether "the pleasure of the text"--the writerly text--could ever penetrate the institions in which readerly paths through culture are enshrined. He writes: What relation can there be between the pleasure of the text and the institutions of the text? Very slight. The theory of the text postulates bliss, but it has little institutional future: what it establishes, its precise accomplishment, its assumption, is a practice (that of the writer), not a science, a method, a research, a pedagogy; on these very principles, this theory can produce only theoreticians or practitioners, not specialists (critics, researchers, professors, students). It is not only the inevitably metalinguistic nature of all institutional research which hampers the writing of textual pleasure, it is also that we are today incapable of conceiv8

ing a true science of becoming (which alone might assemble our pleasure without garnishing it with a moral tutelage). (60) Somewhere in there lies a manifesto for what the world looks like when digital humanities becomes the humanities. Have we not already begun to call ourselves "a community of practice," in preference to "a science, a method, a research, a pedagogy?" But the real message of our technology is something entirely unexpected-- a writerly, anarchic text that is more useful than the readerly, institutional text. Useful and practical not in spite of its anarchic nature, but as a natural consequence of the speed and scale that inhere in all anarchic systems. This is, if you like, the basis of the Screwmeneutical Imperative. There are so many books. There is so little time. Your ethical obligation is neither to read them all nor to pretend that you have read them all, but to understand each path through the vast archive as an important moment in the world's duration--as an invitation to community, relationship, and play.

Introduction: A Difficult Topic, Little Studied, Poorly Understood

It is not hard to see that writing is the single most important technology in human life, yet it is not easy to study or to think about. Nonetheless we use it almost every minute of our lives. Naturally, many handbooks attempt to explain this extraordinary technology, some of good quality, but most suffer from a recurring blindness about what writing is, where it comes from, and how it functions in relationship to speech. All scientific speculation on the history of writing, without exception, is conducted by alphabet-users, including the present study, which gives a bias to our questions and to what we take as answers. Many historians of writing do not read nonalphabetic scripts or have a casual acquaintance with them. The alphabet-using historians of writing make prejudgments that harm our understanding. In this book I will struggle against such prejudgments by providing a scientific nomenclature for understanding writing built on a coherent model of the different internal structures that govern all writing. I want to explicate this nomenclature and this model (see diagram facing the title page) through the study of the history of writing in the ancient Mediterranean, China, and Mesoamerica. This book is not, then, a description of the endless variety of external form in the history of writing, for which good studies exist, but an examination through historical examples of the internal structural principles that govern all writing. By proceeding in this fashion through a dark forest filled with dragons, I hope to slay several and clear away some popular confusions:

· · ·

the illusion that the purpose, origin, and function of writing is to represent speech the common supposition that writing comes from pictures the misapprehension that writing necessarily evolves toward the goal of finer phonetic representation

Introduction: A Difficult Topic

A Chaos of Terms
In no sense is the history of writing a discipline with niches in universities filled by experts. Those who write about the history of writing come from different directions and bring with them the expectations of their own disciplines. Linguists occasionally write such books because they feel that "language" is their province and that writing is somehow language. They are unrealistic about the quality of the phonetic information encoded in systems of writing, and their explanations too often ignore the social and historical forces behind change in systems of writing. Archaeologists sometimes work directly with unfamiliar ancient scripts, but they are rarely trained philologists. Perhaps philologists are in the best position to study the history of writing, if they have learned a nonalphabetic script, because they have wrestled most with the problem of deriving meaning from symbols. Thus the Polish-American Assyriologist I. J. Gelb (1907­85), who worked at the University of Chicago and contributed to the decipherment of "Luvian hieroglyphs," wrote the most important analysis of writing in the twentieth century and laid the foundations for the modern scientific study of writing. His famous book A Study of Writing: The Foundations of Grammatology appeared first in 1952 (revised in 1963). Gelb was wrong in details, but he understood that the history of writing exists, with discoverable underlying principles, as in all historical study. His outline of those principles stands today, and I refer to them often in this book. Above all Gelb urged the use of a consistent and rational vocabulary in discussing the history of writing, although few follow his advice. In reading and thinking about writing we struggle with terms that have their origin in the history of study, not in the nature of the subject. For example, we just referred to "Luvian hieroglyphs" to distinguish this writing from "Hittite cuneiform," but there is nothing hieroglyphic about this writing except the casual and entirely superficial resemblance to the historically unrelated Egyptian hieroglyphs. Both scripts are iconic, that is, we can sometimes recognize in the signs objects from the everyday world ­ for example, a hand, a bird, or an animal ­ but there is no direct historical connection between the scripts and they work in different ways. Another example is the "Ugaritic cuneiform alphabet," which is unrelated to Mesopotamian cuneiform and is not an alphabet. Unfortunately, such terms have stuck, and we are stuck with them, and we are stuck constantly

Introduction: A Difficult Topic

explaining that this or that term is inappropriate. I will put such casual and inaccurate but common terms in "quotations." But the misuse of three words more than any others have harmed the study of the history of writing: "pictogram," "ideogram" (or ideograph), and "alphabet." The word "pictogram" means "picture-writing," but carries with it so much imprecision that we must avoid it rigorously. The use of "pictogram" should be the hallmark of the amateur, but careless professionals go on using it. It is always tempting to call any sign that looks like something a "pictogram," implying that the message is communicated through pictures and not through the resources of speech. Underlying the use but usually unspoken is a specious theory that "writing" began as pictures, then somehow became attached to speech, yet still remained pictures. So written characters that resemble something in the world, like Egyptian hieroglyphs, are called pictograms, as if the sign stands for what they picture and not for elements of human speech or sounds of speech. We do find representations of recognizable objects in early writing, but these "pictures" can fulfill a wide range of functions. Even when such designs appear to stand for the object represented, really they stand for the word attached to the object; that is, they refer to elements of speech, and not directly to items found in the world. "Pictures" can fulfill other functions, for example, place the thing described in a category. When wishing to speak of the representational aspects of some writings, we can call these aspects "iconic". A similar situation pertains to the word "ideogram," often used, for example, of Chinese characters or of a class of signs in Cretan Linear B. Ideogram should mean "idea-writing," that is, the graphic symbolization of an "idea," a Platonic, invisible, eternal, unspoken reality. At one time scholars thought that Egyptian hieroglyphs were just that. But Chinese characters never represent eternal, unspoken realities, and neither do Linear B characters. Probably "ideograms" do not exist, so it makes little sense to talk about them. The deep problems surrounding the word "alphabet" will be the subject of a good part of this book.

Writing, Language, Speech
Writing is old, but writing attached to speech, which I will call lexigraphic writing, goes back only to around 3400 bc, as far as we know. That is a

4

rough date, as are all dates in the fourth millennium, but one we can nonetheless work with. Immense changes have taken place in the art of lexigraphic writing since that time, as one will quickly discover if setting out to learn Akkadian cuneiform. Yet such changes rarely result from evolution, except in writing's earliest stages, and were never inevitable. They came about through the accidents of history and the intercession of individual men of genius working across racial and linguistic bounds, when fresh approaches were possible. There is no certain direction that a writing must take. Because writing systems are arbitrary and conventional they do not respond to nature (whose rules of behavior are not arbitrary and not conventional), but to the inventiveness of unknown creators, who had a purpose too often hidden from us. So improbable is it that anyone should devise a means of encoding elements of speech by means of graphic symbols that in the Old World lexigraphic writing was invented only once, in Mesopotamia, and perhaps a second time, much later, in China. But even in China the idea of "writing" must have come from Mesopotamia over the Gansu corridor north of the Himalayas, where caravan traffic was constant. China was never wholly separated from cultural developments in Mesopotamia. A separate invention did take place in Mesoamerica, providing a test case for principles distilled from the study of Near Eastern writing. We will spend one chapter on writing not attached to speech, which I call semasiography (after I. J. Gelb), but most of this book is about lexigraphic writing. Because such writing is attached to speech, we need a clear description of what we mean by speech. Unfortunately scholars often use "language" when really they mean "speech," as if they were the same thing. "Language" is a formal system of differences and by no means restricted to vocal utterances. In the language of speech, the spoken word "water" is not the spoken word "ice" because they have different forms, to which we attach different meanings. In the language of writing, Egyptian is not

, though, both transliterate as sny: the one means "two" and the other means "companion." Different meanings accompany different forms. Similarly, in the language of writing [$] means something different from [%] because they have different forms to which we assign different significations. These signs belong to the language of writing, and they refer to words, though they do not have phonetic value.

Introduction: A Difficult Topic

The broad category of "language" will also include Morse Code, semaphore, and American sign language, which may refer to speech, but can never be confused with it. Such forms of language as Unicode or mathematical notation do not refer to speech at all. In the study of writing we speak of the "underlying language" essential to deciphering an unknown script, so that we easily forget that writing is itself a kind of language. The confusion between "writing" and "language" is profound, ubiquitous, and disruptive, so that in a popular view Chinese "language" is the same as Chinese "writing," a confusion that turns out, oddly, to be true once we understand how little Chinese writing has to do with Chinese speech. Lexigraphic writing is based in speech, yes, but because we know of ancient speech only through written documents, it is easy to think that we are talking about "language" or "speech" when really we are talking about graphic representations that make use of spoken lexical elements, which may constitute in themselves a kind of language, but by no means intend to preserve actual speech. The intention is to communicate information, and for this purpose a graphic system with systematic phonetic ties to speech is a tool of earth-shaking power. It is not, however, a tool for the preservation of ancient speech. For this reason the Sumerian speech was of use to nonSumerian Semitic scribes, because the relationships between graphic symbols and symbols originating in speech had been established by ancient usage. Just so, it was logical and practical for medieval Europeans to use Latin as a basic system for understanding across the polyglot confusion of mutually unintelligible local dialects and languages. Sumerian written in cuneiform ("wedge-shaped") writing was a traditional system of signs for communicating information whether you were Sumerian or not, and as such worked well. For the same reason, during the dominance of Assyria over the Near East during the ninth to seventh centuries bc and of Persia in the sixth to fifth centuries bc, the West Semitic Aramaic script encoding lexical forms from the "Aramaic language" was used by nonAramaicspeaking scribes over an area stretching from the Mediterranean to northwest India. For example, in Figure 0.1, from the palace at Nineveh of Tiglath Pileser III (ruled 745­727 bc), one of the most successful commanders who ever lived, a beardless eunuch on the left calls out a list of booty while the presumably Assyrian-speaking eunuch in the middle records the inventory in the contemporary Assyrian dialect by impressing cuneiform characters with a stylus into a waxed wood tablet. The presumably Assyrian-speaking

eunuch scribe on the right makes a duplicate record (to prevent cheating?) by writing on a roll of papyrus or leather, certainly West Semitic Aramaic characters tied to Aramaic speech. The difference in writing medium, part of any writing tradition, accompanies a difference in script and "underlying language." Lexigraphic writing may refer to elements of speech, but in real speech we find extraordinary local and social differences, so great among English speakers that TV interviews in a regional English are often given subtitles for the greater English-speaking audience; that is, by means of alphabetic writing the speech is reduced to a standard form. Even in the same town speakers may not understand one another across differences in class and social background, although they "speak the same language." In my own experience, once, in Alexandria, Egypt, my middle-class guide was unable to communicate with a street sweeper who may have known the location of our hotel, yet both spoke "Arabic." Only writing, and especially alphabetic writing supported by political power and social prestige, creates the illusion that a "language" such as English

Introduction: A Difficult Topic

7

is a single thing, out there, bounded, defined, and capable of discovery. Writing's overarching power stabilizes speech, represses local differences, and fashions standards for thought and expression. Dante's Florentine dialect was one of hundreds of local Italic vernaculars descended from Latin, but his written Commedia in a fourteenth-century Florentine dialect created "the Italian language." Many books speak of the Phoenician, Hebrew, Moabite, Aramaic, and Syriac "languages" when, really, they are looking at small variations in the forms of West Semitic writing applied over a broad geographical area to a single speech-family that we might loosely call "Semitic," with local differences based on a similar phonology (a selection of voice sounds) and a similar inner structure. For example, in Hebrew the word for son is bn and in Aramaic it is br, but in Cambridge, Massachusetts, spirits to drink are /lika/ and in Seattle they are /likor/. Still, spoken communication takes place. The imperative "carry!" is qabur in the Hebrew "language," qabor in Syriac, 'uqbur in Arabic and qabar in Ethiopic, but all are mildly different expressions from a single underlying system. The great family of Semitic languages has very many regional variations, and we are simply never sure when a dialect has slipped over into a new "language," that is, when a speaker within one system can no longer understand a speaker from another system. But twenty years of study of the holy Quran, certainly written in Arabic, will not enable the student to converse, even about simple things, with an inhabitant of Fez, Cairo, or Damascus, where everyone speaks "Arabic." The confusion is clear in Figure 0.2, a type of chart that appears in many books on writing. The chart catalogues the transformations undergone by the West Semitic signary (in which a hypothetical but wholly unproven priority is given to Phoenician script). Such graphic variations are taken as designating the different languages of "Phoenician," "Moabite," various forms of "Aramaic," and "Hebrew." But such different "languages" are as close to one another as Quranic Arabic is to spoken Arabic in its myriad and often mutually unintelligible varieties. It is true that, schooled in the Phoenician script of 1000 bc, one will have a hard time reading "Palmyrene Aramaic" of the third century ad, the script and language used in the caravan city of Palmyra in the Syrian desert, but these are nonetheless the same script with formal differences growing over more than one thousand years. The underlying "language" has remained the same. Such charts are really a study in handwriting, or paleography, with limited importance for understanding the theory and history of writing, and they do not describe an evolution of "language."

In sum, the ambiguous correspondence of language and speech afflicts all such studies as this one, because speech, sometimes called "spoken language," certainly is a language, but not all language is speech. We will need constantly to speak of the "language" underlying systems of writing,

even if we really mean "speech." In this case by "language" we refer to a system of phonic symbols intelligible to speaker and listener, more or less, over a wide range of variation. However, that system of phonic symbols could never itself be the "language" of the lexigraphic writing, because lexigraphic writing is its own language, making use of the resources of speech but never identical with it. "To speak a language" means something ­ if you speak Greek, you may enter the Mysteries at Eleusis; if you don't, you can't. Nonetheless, language, speech, and lexigraphic writing are all tangled up and, once we acknowledge their boundaries and differences, we must to some extent live with the confusion.

Transliterations
In the case of writing that is related to speech we must constantly deal with reconstructions of the sounds of speech encoded in the writing. In talking about the forms of characters and the sounds of speech I will follow the conventional practice of using brackets [ ] to enclose a given form or shape, how something looks, how it is written, and slashes / / to indicate the sound. For example, in Egyptian hieroglyphs the sign [ ] represents the sound /m/ (plus an implied vowel). Unfortunately, each discipline has its own system, or more than one, for transcribing sounds, which originated in the history of the discipline. Such systems, internal to a discipline, are not themselves consistent, but may differ in England and Germany and even in the same place. For example, the Egyptian character for /y/ is written sometimes as [è] and sometimes as [j]. The situation is worse between disciplines. The glottal stop, when the throat closes as before and between "uh-oh," is represented as ['] in transliterations from West Semitic, but as [Ç] by Egyptologists, although the sound is the same. Ideally, everyone might use the admirable International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as a means to suggest the sound values in systems of writing (see Fig. 14.3), and sometimes you do find this. However, few readers without formal training in linguistics understand the symbols of the IPA, the use of which can become a kind of game of phonetic precision that misrepresents the enormous phonetic ambiguity in all writing systems. Furthermore, the IPA is not easy to learn or to understand.

10

Introduction: A Difficult Topic

The problem of consistency in transliteration is not solvable, and in this book I have chosen, as much as possible, to use systems of transliteration traditional within a discipline, explaining myself as I go, but cautioning the reader about the need for flexibility and attention to sometimes subtle distinctions.

What Is Writing?

Writing, writing, it is everywhere, yet few have much to say about it, few know about it. Writing is an inherently difficult topic because discussion of it takes place by means of the very medium being discussed. As fish who know nothing of water, scholars who spend their lives studying different traditions of literature, and of writing, rarely reflect on the actual technology that makes their study possible: how it works, where it came from, and what relation it bears to other formal systems of thought. Writing is magical, mysterious, aggressive, dangerous, not to be trifled with. Although it takes many forms, it is always a technology of explosive force, a cultural artifact based not in nature (whose rules we did not create) but sprung from the human mind. Human groups who possess writing triumph over those who do not, without exception and swiftly. If humans had existed a year, writing was invented not even yesterday, but some time this afternoon, as far as we know. Writing cast a veil across the human past, separating the million human years that came before from the turbulent last five thousand years. In the brief period since the discovery in Sumer around 3400 bc of the phonetic principle in graphic representation ­ when conventional markings first represented sounds of the human voice ­ the cultures encoded in this and subsequent related traditions of writing have changed human life forever. Writing is the most important technology in the history of the human species, except how to make a fire. Writing is the lens through which literate peoples see the world, feel the world, hate the world, love the world, defy the world, and imagine change. What is writing that, like the lens you never see, creates the world? The difficult topic is muddled and mixed up with other things that have their own life ­ religion, artistic expression, speech, and human thought.

What Is Writing?

The Magic, Romance, and Danger of Writing
The holy Quran, encoded in the holy, even divine, script that the prophet himself used, is a sacred document that can never be changed or corrected or amended or mutilated or abused or transliterated into Roman characters: That would be an offense to God and punishable by death. Thus a book can be a fetish, as when one swears when placing a hand on a Bible or Quran: If the swearer is foresworn, he will suffer evil consequences. The text of the sacred Quran justifies mass murder, according to some interpretations, but you can never be sure because of the surprising obscurity of the wholly phonetic Arabic script, its distance from speech. What does it really say? The Jewish religion similarly depends on written documents in whose holy, magical, emotive symbols cabbalists discover secrets of the universe. Fortunately, the rabbi ("my master") can explicate textual obscurities to the ignorant, the less learned, as do the wise mullahs to the faithful. Ancient Egyptian civilization, too, was bound to the forms and expectations of hieroglyphic writing to an extraordinary degree. The conventions of hieroglyphic writing influenced the posture of statues and the shapes and layout of temples, and, in the revelator Akhenaten's sacred city of Akhetaten ("Horizon of the Aten," near the modern village of Amarna), the design of the whole city described the form of the hieroglyph for "horizon," over which the sun god daily rose. Egyptian writing could also make one live forever, a signal advantage. Mao Zedong (1893 ­1976), who pretended to hate the past, hoped to replace the obscurantist Chinese system of writing with an alphabet, but even his unlimited power could not accomplish the change. To change the writing would change the sacred ancient culture that the Chinese adore, which the mysterious and beautiful writing encodes. By changing the writing, one loses everything. That was precisely the intention of Kemal Atatürk when, in the 1920s, he outlawed the traditional Arabic script and ordered that Roman script now encode the Turkish language ­ thus did he break with the corrupt and ruinous past of the Ottoman sultans. Jesus wrote in the sand (John 8), but in stark wisdom left nothing behind for followers to kill themselves over. They found other reasons. He must have understood how writing, and writings, can lead to fanaticism, social division, oppression, and the tyranny of the mad and the intolerant over the common man. So great is the power of writing. We would like to know why writing has such exaggerated effects on human life and where it gets its power. The common definition of civilization as

What Is Writing?

13

"human life in cities in the presence of writing" may be a historical judgment, but it is also a speculation on the superiority of a cultural practice that symbolizes human thought and carries it beyond the place and time of its origin. Writing enjoys intimate affection with the human faculty to create symbols, when one thing stands for another. Without this faculty, we would not be human. The relationship between the sounds of human speech and graphic material symbols that represent such sounds in lexigraphic writing is a central problem.

A Definition of Writing
Writing is hard to see because it governs our thoughts, and hard to talk about because of the lack of consistent names for real categories. We know that writing is there to be read, but are not sure what we mean by "writing," so that it is fashionable in criticism to "read" works of art or to "read" Greek culture or manners of dress or almost anything, as if in understanding a work of art or a building or a social practice we are doing the same thing as when we read a text. Writing has been defined time and again, always in different ways, but let us say that writing is a system of markings with a conventional reference that communicates information, like the signs on this page. Where does such a definition take us? Because writing is made up of markings it is material (not spiritual or emotional or mental). The meaning of such markings, their conventional reference, we might say their intellectual dimension, never comes from nature, as does the human faculty for symbolization and speech, nor from God (as many have believed), but from man. The elements of writing, the markings, are related in an organized way, in a conventional way, in order to tell the reader something, to communicate with the reader. Where there is writing there is a reader who understands the system of conventions, even if the reader is God or a god (as often).

Change and Evolution in Systems of Writing
General principles appear to govern how any writing can work, as they appear to underlie the formation of speech. The possibilities of organization are limited and in some way predetermined. Hence, the history of writing is

14

What Is Writing?

a history of the discovery of these principles, drawn in intelligible patterns. Because systems of writing are conventional and exist by agreement rather than coming from nature or God, there is no right or wrong to how a system imparts its meanings. Systems of writing serve different purposes for different peoples at different times. It is wrong to imagine that the Bronze Age Mycenaean Greeks would have been better off with the later Greek alphabet or with Chinese writing or anything else. Linear B did what it was called to do, to keep economic accounts in a palace-centered redistributive economy, and no one required more. Nonetheless, because the history of writing is a history of discovery, we are tempted to compare writing systems as if they were in a competition for greatness and to say, for example, that the Greek alphabet is superior to Japanese writing, so complex that less than a dozen non-Japanese in the United States of America could read it when the Imperial Japanese Navy struck on December 7, 1941. Within the historical competition between human groups and the struggle for political and cultural dominion such comparisons are probably justified and fairly belong to an evaluation of the past. The Greek alphabet in its Roman form has in three thousand years become the dominant writing system by far, whereas Japanese writing remains confined to a small archipelago. Apologists for scripts unrelated to the Greek alphabet like to point out that it was not so much the Roman script as Western political power behind the script that brought the alphabet's hegemony, as if the script did not itself make possible (though not inevitable) such power. Because among the users of any writing the system will satisfy the needs placed upon it, we cannot expect to find improvement or radical change within a developed lexigraphic writing system except in its earliest stages of formation. Both Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs appear to undergo evolution in the several hundred years between the first clear evidence of phoneticization, c.3400­3200 bc, and the creation of texts that reflect grammar and syntax, c.2700 bc; hundreds of years more must pass before we find extended texts. We must, of course, depend on evidence from haphazard finds. In the Eastern civilizations of the ancient world, it was not so much that the scribes who developed the first complex lexigraphic systems served the power elite as that they themselves were that elite; once their systems were in place, they could hardly have imagined, let alone desired, developments that would simplify their systems and undermine their power, or even make them irrelevant in the scheme of things. The Egyptian schoolbook taught that one should

The scribe, whatever his place at the Residence [pharaoh's court], he cannot be poor in it. from Satire on the Trades (or Instructions of Dua-Khety), c.1800 bc

The scribe is wealthy and content and always in the ancient world male (but some women, especially in Rome, could read and write). Change within developed systems of writing, where it is found, is a kind of tinkering, and then, ordinarily, toward greater complexity and obscurity, more of the scribal art. Egyptian hieroglyphics managed with about 700 signs for most of its history, but, in a quirky development of the self-conscious Ptolemaic period (323 ­30 bc), increased its repertory to 5,000 signs. Attempts to "improve" a system of writing threaten the conventional basis by which it exists and diminish its intelligibility so that everything worsens. For example, many have complained about the famously inept ­ that is, nonphonetic ­ English or French spellings. The American Philological Association was founded in 1869 to study the world's languages; it boldly encouraged spelling reforms much in the air in the late nineteenth century by publishing its proceedings in a reformed spelling. Today, they can scarcely be read. When Mao Zedong found he could not impose the Roman script, in the interests of the people he simplified the bizarrely intricate Chinese writing by omitting strokes from many characters to improve readability. He thereby rendered Chinese writing unintelligible to Chinese living in Taiwan, San Francisco, and Southeast Asia, whose traditional Chinese characters are now unreadable on the mainland. Major changes in the structure of writing systems took place when the idea of writing passed from one people to another, always foreign people. Not bound by sacred tradition and the interests of a social class and intellectual elite, illiterate foreigners could make important changes. In the changes

16

What Is Writing?

made in this way we can speak of the evolution of writing, of a process proceeding from less able to more able systems of writing.

Writing Is Material
Because writing has a material basis it can be created and destroyed, as bookburners throughout history understand. In the ancient Near East the origin of this life-transforming technology seems to be connected in some way with the use of material objets, abstract "counters" or tokens made of clay that represented commodities, according to a famous argument by Denise Schmandt-Besserat. One carried such material, tangible things in a pouch or on a string around the neck or dropped them accidentally on the ground or exchanged them during a transaction or wrapped them up in a hollow ball of clay, to preserve details of a commercial transaction. After five thousand years of such token use in the Near East, between c.8000 and c.3000 bc, the abstract shapes of some portable material tokens seem to have become characters in the first lexigraphic writing (see Chapter 3). Even such obsolete systems of communication based on writing as semaphore require material flags moving in someone's hands. Morse code seems immaterial. Consisting of an ON/OFF digital mode, it is the only digital-modulation mode that humans can understand without a computer. Nonetheless, messages transmitted by Morse code are directly transferred into written documents. As a property protected by law, writing in cyberspace is in an awkward position, because the relationship of cyberspace to the material world is not clear, and we are unsure how laws of copyright apply to a medium you cannot control. The power of hardcopy, whose doom many predicted, remains strong in comparison to electronic documents because the tangible hardcopy is not endlessly permutable and easy to lose. Contracts, wills, and certificates of marriage, anything having to do with money, remain in hardcopy. Even as pixels on a computer screen, even when floating in cyberspace, writing retains its material basis.

Speech and Writing
In seeking a definition of writing, scholars sometimes take account of writing's materiality but nonetheless emphasize writing as a secondary

What Is Writing?

17

representation of the primary speech. The influential L. Bloomfield, in a book called Language (1933), wrote that "writing is not language, but merely a way of recording language by means of visible marks" (Bloomfield 1933: 21). By "language" he must mean "speech," which writing obviously is not. But is not writing really a language in its own right? The distinguished Mayanist Michael Coe, writing on progress in the decipherment of Maya glyphs, notes that "writing is speech put in visible form in such a way that any reader instructed in its conventions can reconstruct the vocal message. All linguists are agreed on this, and have been for a long time" (Coe 1992: 13, my italics). Coe agrees with Bloomfield, but sees that language and speech are different things. By having "visible form" writing must be material, but "vocal message" nonetheless lies at the heart of the definition. A. Parpola, the distinguished scholar of the Indus Valley writing, calls writing "a visual communication system based on the representation of spoken language by conventional marks of some durability" (Parpola 1994: 29). Is Braille a "visible communication system"? Certainly it is writing. Parpola's "durability" implies materiality, but still writing represents "spoken language." The great Assyriologist and historian of writing I. J. Gelb thought along similar lines, declaring that "writing is written language . . . I agree entirely with the linguists who believe that fully developed writing became a device for expressing linguistic elements by means of visible marks" (Gelb 1963: 13). Because in Gelb's view the phonographic element, "a device for expressing linguistic elements," is the essence of "fully developed writing," or "full writing," the Greek alphabet, beyond which the art of writing has not progressed, came at the apex of a long development. The Greek alphabet is even the telos, the immanent goal, toward which "writing" has always striven, because in the Greek alphabet the phonographic element is overriding. P. L. Daniels, in his and P. T. Bright's useful book The World's Writing Systems, thinks that "writing is defined as a system of more or less permanent marks used to represent an utterance in such a way that it can be recovered more or less exactly without the intervention of the utterer" (Daniels and Bright 1996: 3, original italics). By this definition he agrees that writing is bound up with speech (an utterance) and, in company with other scholars, excludes from "writing" communication by means of symbols or representations not couched in a specific linguistic form. However, in his insistence on recovering an utterance "more or less exactly" Daniels's surprising formulation would exclude all forms of writing up to the Greek alphabet, and even, strictly speaking, the Greek alphabet itself, because

18

What Is Writing?

no writing before or including it permitted the recovery of an original utterance "more or less exactly." When such recovery took place in actual usage it did so on the basis of a shared language between writer and reader and shared expectations based on the context of the message, not on the basis of the phonetic and semantic information encoded in the script. Such understandings of writing as being a secondary representation of the primary speech are always re-expressions of F. Saussure's famous dictum: "A language and its written form constitutes two separate systems of signs. The sole reason for the existence of the latter is to represent the former" (Saussure [1922] 1983: 24). Saussure only echoed Aristotle's formulation: "Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience and written words are the symbols of spoken words" (Aristotle, de Interpretatione 1.1). First comes "language," then comes its "written form," which depends on "language." Yet in its dependence on a material basis, writing is fundamentally unlike speech, which is never tangible. The relationship between written form and speech is more complicated than such commentators believe. Writing is a technology with a material basis, while speech is never a technology and never material but an essentially human aptitude. If dolphins could speak, they would be humans with an odd-shaped nose. In our own definition that writing is a system of markings with a conventional reference that communicates information, we do not refer to speech, language, or utterance. In the definitions of commentators quoted above, the words "speech" and "language" are treated interchangeably and in the clumsy way we complained about earlier. How writing functions will depend on the innate faculty of humans to communicate by means of symbols. A language is any system of symbols that serves this innate faculty to communicate through symbols: speech is one such system of symbols, writing is another (see diagram opposite title page).

Cttbist painting, ;tS described in the epigraphs to this chapter, not only fi:acnored the single viewpoint bur also placed disparate objects on the same spar.ial plane, adjacent and simultaneo\o s. In striking contrast to the many modes of representation that shattered the li:x:ity of single-point perspective, the media of 6Jm and televisioo- io their dominant forms through most of the twentieth century-were viewed ino a single frame, seen on a siogle screen. Variations of scale, position, and camera angle from shot to shot roay alter the positioned fixity of the camera's view, but these shifts in "pe.rspcetive" are sequential and do not occur on the same picture plane as in cubist painting, chronophotogrophy, or dadaist collage.' As moving images follow each other in sequence-frame-by- frame, shot-by-shot-they are held within the fixed fr·me of a screen, a surface that holds its constancy regardless of the contiJ>Uous or radically discontinuous spatial and temporal relation betweeo shots. In t.h.is way, the prevailing form:lt for moving-image media did not follow literary, painterly, or even architecnmJ challenges to the perspectival frame but held on much longer to the strictures of its "symboijc form ~ J n t.he century-loog history o.f film and thc half-century-long history of tclevis.ion, there are only limited examples of either multiple-screen display or multiple- screen composition within the single frame 3 That is, until recendy.

' But these exceptions also prove the rule. T11e rapid and recent remaking of cinematic, relevisual, and computer-based torms of imaging and display force us to note, in retrospect, the remarkable historical domi.nao1ce of the siogle-irnage, siogle-frame paradigm as an intrdnsigent visual practice. Tb.e tclevisual image largely followed the cinema's conventions of a single-screen fo rmat and sequential fiow, but ooce the televisual apporacus became a multiple-channel receive( wiru the capacity for switching channels at will, aided and accelerated by a remote-control device, television added a new axis of spatial and temporal depth to the cinema's fixed sequentiality.

THE SIN GLE F RAME, THE SINGLE SCREEN

In Charles Mussels account, the "~jsrory of screen practice" was marked by several major technological transfonnations: the devclopmenr of the magic lantern in che r6sos, the adapt~rion of photogrnph.ic sUdes for projtction arou nd rSso, and rhe proje..'tion of chrono-phorographic images around 18<);.' These technical turning poims in the emergence of a "sc~een practice" mark the addirion of photography to
magic Lan tern projection. Yet an examinado n of

the emerging cultural practi=< of image projection will ;\lso indicate what remained constant during these changes: viewers fAced projected images on a screen, and most comtnonly, rhese images \\'ere projected se<tnentially rather rhan arrayed adjace.ntly.J·, This practice was not dcrc:rmi ned by the Umits of existing techno.logy but, instead, by the representational co,wenfion of the single image in a single frame. Multiple lantems were routindy used by phantasmagoria exhibitors to create composite ellects; two projectors could have been placed side by side liom the earliest mome11ts of
screen practice. Although the popular mid-nineteenth-century

term for slide projection-the "stercopticon"might seem to indicate a S}"Stem for two-slide
projecrion, the ternt was adapted becau..~ of the

co1runon practice of transferring stereoscope views

ro grow1d glass, cutting the doubl.e im~ge in hill; and selling them separarely as lantern slides."

T HE MULT IPLE

This form of Dissolving View seems the one most in general use at the present 6me."" The "Bi-Unial" lautern h;\d two separate optical systems and technically could have projected images in multiple array. Instead, the standard practice iovoh·ed 1rsi.ng the two lenses to d issolve between images-one on top of the other - in the appearance of a single frame. In this regard, the emerging use of projected lameru slides in art history lectures formed an important contrast to the predominant forms of latenineteenth-century entertainment and the emerging fo rmat for movu1g images. The com parative method of the double-slide lecture became one of the pedagogical mainstays of Gennan art historian Heinrich Wolffiin soon after he began r.o lecture at the University of Berlin ul 1901. \· VO!IHin's predecessor at the Uo.iversiry of Berlin, Hermann Grimm, had used slides extensively in his lectures in the late 189os. Wolffiin began co use two slide projectors, arranged side by side, so that he could compare different images or show details alongside the principal image. The usc of double-slide projection allowed the viewer co consider one image in relation to another image- to compare an image t.o one oi an earlier time, to a closer detail, to a contrasting style. T he conclusions drawn from this metl1od were comparative and analytic."' By contrast, the emerging mode of moving- image projection retauled the singularity of one image, one scre-en. As lantern images were projected in increasingly rapid succession (with appaT"dtuses like L. S. Bcal's r866 choreuroscope or Coleman Sellets's r86r kinemaro&ope, or Muybridge's r88o photographicbased 7 .oopraxiscope), images were projected in seqllential dissolve.'" Between r896 and r9oo, many different inventor$, manufa.cn.lre.rs, filmmakers, exhibitors, and entrepreneurs struggled to define the format and venue ior moving images, but there was a remarkable consistency in tbe for m of single-screen projection.'· The technical systems for projection available by 1896-the Lumieres' C inemarographe, R. W. Paul's animarographe and 'llreatrograph, Jenkins and fumat's Phaotoscope, Edison's Vitascope, but also Lyman H . Howe's anitnotoscope, W. Watson's motograph, \1\fj)Jjam Paley's kalatccl.noscope, Hennan Casler's Biograph, C harles Urban's bioscope, and Latham's eidoloscope- all had different CaJYabilities and relie.d on dilfercnt patents and construction, but they had one oommon element: :llll projected single-screen images, seen in a single frame." Even so, the many systems for exhibiting moving images demonstrated the uncertainty about what the predominant form of d1e medium would be. At dre Paris r9oo Exhibition, Raoul Grimoin-Sanson's ten-projector Cineorama provided spectators witb an unframed 36o -degrce view of projected moving cmages,

The first recorded moving images evidenced a broad ra nge of camera angles, camera distances, and locations-the Lumiere brothers' outdoor actunlitis of \<orkers leaving tl>e uuniere photographic plate l: ~ctory (Sortie d'u.rint. filmed directly fucing the action), the arrival of a train ar the station (Arriv.fe d'tm trai11 aLa Ciotnt, filmed fro m a dynamic diagonal angle), and the baby eating breakl:~r (Repas de btbi, film ed from a closer camera position), or the in-studio fil ms

here. For DeJeuze, following Bergson, the frame is a.o "imm.obile section" that gives «f.Usc movement." As Deleuze not.es, siileot filmmakers experimented with the boundaries of the frame: "The iris metlhod in C riflith, which isolates a f.1ce first of all, then opens and shows the surroundings; Eisenstein's researches inspired by Japanese dmwing, which adapt the frA me to the theme; Gance's variable screen which opens and closes 'according to the dramatic necessities,' aod Uke a 'visual acco rdion'-from the very beginning attempts were made to test dynamic variations of rhe frame.

note that these compositional framing devices or partial frames still rc.m ain within the boundaries of the screen.

These multiple-screen practices "expanded" cinema co venues outside of the commercial movie theater. Experiments in screen format have occ:ut'fed at critical crossroads in the history of rnoving-image technology. Eisenstein proposed a "dinamk screen"
amid the reformulation of aspect ratio in the '"~'.tkc of the late r9ws transjcion to sound. In the c.arly 1950S, in response to another set of cconomk and techno-

logical challenges to the film industry (divestiture, the commercial introduction of television), a variety of new screen formats were introduced. The expanded S<'<een aspect ratios of Cinerama aud Cinero.~Scope challenged Jilmmakers co use the e..·panded horizontal scope of the f~C.tme. Despite the following catalog of split-screen and multiple-screen projects, <these e. ' amples remain rare e.xceptlons to dornioant screen practice.
SP LIT SCREENS, MULTIPLE SCREENS

In the 1950s, filmmakers took advantage of dle new aspect ratio to divide the scrttn into component screens. In the opening prologue of 1'hiJ Is Ci11erama!, the feature-length travelogue produced for C.inerama~s initial cornmc.r dal demonstration in t95~, Lowell Thomas narrates a familiar teleology of motion picture history, tracing the desire t<> "reproduce narure" from citve paintirtgs to ro.1gic lauterus, nickelodeons and silent movie-making. As Thomas begins his account, he is seen ou a screen with the standard Academy 4:3 aspect ratio. Aud y expands its format and \videns to Cinerama's then, as the screen dramaticaU 31 wider aspect r:njo, Thomas announces: "T his is Cinerama!" Althougb the patented Cinerama process involved recording with a tbreclens a unern and projecting with three projectors outo a concave $(.~reen, Cinerama was L·rgely deployed for seamless continu.ity between the three screens.32 With the exception of the occasional loss of registration (as in the th.ree-leggcd woman who appears in Saint Mark's Square in Venice, a freak byproduct of a mistake in camera alignment), most of the 6lm's eleven segment.< rely on the scope of the dongared rectaagular frame ro demonstrate the wrap-around immersion of the wide screen.

are lilmed in three-screen registration to demonstrate the panoramic expanse of the 146-degree Cinerama screen. One sequence of the lilm, however, divides the panoramic display into its three constituent segments, in a manner similar to Gance's Polyvision. Set iu Florid,.'s proto-theme park, the Cypress Gardeus segment <>xploits a three-way split of the screen. Speedboats pul.l "Aquabel.les" and "Aquabats" on water skis through the canals of Florida's Lake Eloise in au elaborate triptych choreography. The three-screen split shows the race not in a sequential cross-cut but in multiple simultaneous juxtaposition' ' Nevertheless, the predominant use of the three- projector Cinerama system was to hide the " seams" between each screen and give the illusion of an expansive, continuous panoramic display. As indicated in the promotional brochure accompanying This Is Cinerama!: "Not only has the screen a new shape and dimension, but now there are three projection booths simultaneously throwing the image ,on the scrccn- a clear, bright image that almost imperceptibly merges into one great, panoramic picture."" As anodler example of splitting d1e expanded horrtontal aspect ratio of the widened frame, several sequences of the anamorphic widescreen Cinema Scope film It~ Always Fair Weather (1 955, dir. Gene KeUy and Stanley Donen) split the screen into a triptych. The three-way split forms the perfect analog to the lilrn's narrative about the sepantion and reunion of three World War II war buddies (Gene Kelly, Dan Dalley, Michael Kidd). At the end of the war, Kelly tears a dollar bill into three pieces, one for each of the buddies. Each veteran goes his separate way. (Jolu> Belton also notes that tbe aspect ratio of the American dollar bill is "by strange coincidence~ almost exacdy the same shape as CinemaScope' z.Jp)." ln the mu.sical number "I Shouldn't Have Come," Donen uses a three·way split screen to show the three protagonists as they separately regret their reunion. Like many 1950s lilms that addressed the threat of television by incorporating it into its plor, the final brawl is at a TV studio but seen through the windows of the control booth and in the multiple-screen display of dle sru·
clio's television monitors. Whether or not, as Belton suggests, Donen's use of a

three-way split screen "playfully pa:rodies" the three camera/three projector system of Cinerama, It's Aluwyr Fair Weather used the single-projector CinemaStope format to fracture simultaneous action into comparative adjacent display. Another Cinema Scope (z.Js:t) lilm, Pillow Talk (dir. Michael Gordon,1959), used a two-way split screen to establish both the separation and the connection between its two protagonists-the single career woman played by Doris Day and the playboy songwriter played. by Rock Hudson. Day and Hudson share a party line; Day can't receive or make calls when Hudson is on the line romancing his many girlfriends. 'I11e screen is split to reveal their two separate habitats

and the telephonic link between them. In the still shown in figun: 5·"· the frame edge is playfully eroticized. As Day and Hudson each ree!ine, nude in separare bathtubs, each places a bare foot on the wall."' The two sections of the split screen abut in the center of the frame, and Da)'s and Hudson's feet touch along the boundary that separates them. As in \IVeber and Smalley's StJJpmu, the telephone links these separate spaces, seen here in temporal, not sp::ttial, contiguity. The use of the split screen for its narrative possibilities continued into the 196os. In some cases, filmmakers were directly inspired by multiple-screen exhibitions seen at world's !airs. tor the '959 Moscow vVorld's !"air, the u.s. Department of State commissioned designer George Nelson and the Los Angeles-based rerun of Ray and Charles Eames to design a multimedia exhibit on American Lif e. The sheer number of images (2,200) displayed rhe abundance of life in the United States- automobiles, la\VJunowcrs, washing machines, rcJevisions, a plenitude magnified by the multiple (seven) screens." The exhibit's coy title, Gfimp$£$ ofthe usn, suggested that, in one swift but multiplied glimpse, the United States was a land of abundrutt cousumer durables, skyscrapers, housing projects, expansive highways, and the shiny ru1d happy people who use them. TI1e Eruneses drew upon a repertoire of images li·om their database of more than Jso,ooo slides, and rhe mulriple-screen presentation multiplied the impression ofscale. As Bearriz Colomina has suggested, the Eameses' multiplesc..reen technique was organized \\-ith the logic of data corn pression, condensing a large quantity of information into a compressed physical space." Seve.n twenty-by-thirry-foot screens were mounted inside an exp:msive geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller.-"' After the success of Glimpses (it was seen by three million Soviet citizens and received wide critical acclaim), the Eameses received another government commission for a multiscrccn (six· screen) presentation at the 196· World's Fair in Seattle.

In the full of 1965, a survey entitled E"f>rmt!ed Cirtemn was screened at the Film l\1aker's Cinematheque in New York Ciry. "There were artists working "~tb sound-light-multiple pJojections for a good ten years," wrote reviewer Jonas Mekas, "but they remained in experimen1:11l, semi-private stages until the E-xpanded Cinema Survey."" BeiWeen corJX> rAtely sponsored projects for world's fair pavilions and "expanded cinema" performances that included film projection alongside other forms of light-play-slide shows, searchlights with color gels, strobe lights, mirror-balls-multiple-screen projection became a marked vist1al display practice of the 196os." 1965-1966 In 1965 and 1996, Andy VVarhol, whose serial painted portraits and silk-screen multiples placed repeated images in serial display, beg:>n to also place moviog images in multiple array.'; In Outer nnd Inner Spau (1965, black and white, 33 mirLUtes), Warhol doubled the frame of the film screen by placing a video screen in the shot and then doubled the frame agruin by projecting two reds of film side-by-side."' As if in a mixed-media update of Edwin S. Porter's Undejoshat tl~e MO'IJing Pi<trm Show, \~1arhol framed his blonde supecscar Edie Sedgwick in front ofhc.r framed prerecorded vi.deo image. In a dever confrontation between the two competing media formats-video/television and film-Sedgwick's image was multiplied, quadrupled, in a mirrored mise m abyme. Jn the vide¢ inset, Sedgwick is ftamed in profile conversio.g with someone just of!Scrcen, oil~ f(allle. Bu t within the. film frame, tbe video monitor is placed in the back of the shot, and Sedgwick faces toward the filr.n carnera as if she is t.alki.og to someone just oifscreen, off-frame. On the few occasions when Sedgwick faces the inset screen, she faces herself as if in a mirror but with a time delay. (AltJ,ough the sound is at poin ts garbled, Sedgwick's portrait is also an auc·.ll one. At points she mocks herself, mouthing her words as she hears them and sees them on the video monitor.) As portraiture, r.h e nmltiplication of Sedgwick's iroogegives che effect of a quadrupled Edie, talking about fa111e aod celebrity in an empty feedback IO<>p. Warhol's title, Outer and ltmer Space, names the complex spatial and temporal pl:ty tl1at occurs between the outside and inside of the frame of t!te ·rv set and the frame of the film screen as it touches another screen in its multiple adjacent display. O ne might think cl>at Maw·;ce Merleau -Ponty, in his i94S leetun: on fiJrn aod the "new psychology,· had anticipated the philosophical gra,'ity of \.Yarhol's e.xperi.ment: "if philosophy is in harmony with the cinema, if thought and technical effort are heading in the same di.rectio11, it is because the philosopher and the rnoviernaker share a certain way of being, a certain ,;ew of

J\ s in Outer tmd Irmer Spilu, Lupe uses the doubling of two S<:'.reens in adjacent display to suggest the fracru.red subformance in jectivity of Sedgwick/Velez. In a morbid forecast, Sedgwick's pe· Lupe mirrored her own death by ove··dose in 197l.·s Warhol's most ambitious two-screen project, The Chelsea Gir!J (1 966, 210 minutes), projected twelve s ingle-take (ilm reds in double-screen display. Jonas Mekas describes the four-hour "epic movic· novd" filmed in the C hc.lsca H otel as "a series of rooms at the Chelsea Hotel, two rooms projected side by side at the same time. with difkrent people in different rooms~ or sometimes, overlapping,"·· And although Mekas doesn't linger on this model ofdoubJe-scJ-een pn)jcction as a doUhouse in a.'<onometric cross-section, he claims:"& the time goes, this gallery of people and ~ves grows into a complex human hive.

Instead of random ju.xmpositioo of multiple- screen display, the narrative linearity of Kino-Automat was split into branching alternatives, dependent o n the majo rity vote. In the weeks before he began shooting The Thomas Crown A.ffoir (r968), Norman Jewison took bis cinematographer Haskell Wexler and editor Hal Ashby to Expo '67 to see ano ther multiple-screen project, C hristopl>er Chapman's A Place to Stand. jcwison credits Chapman,s "multi-screen technique: '' as an inspiring model for bis comple.x use of multiple inset screens in The Thoma.< Crown A.ffoir; "\>Ve were trj·ing to teU Jive stories," Jewison recounts, claiming "we used the multiple screen as a. story- telling device . .. long before digir.U effects and computerized technoi<>gy."6 ' Another film from 1968, The Boston Strangler (dir. Richard Fleischer), used multiple inset screens (in different si-·es and combinations) as a storytelling device. Flei.<cher split the screen into multiple views showing the prec -autions that Boston residents take-locking their doo rs, b\>)'ing guns, walking in twos or threes at night -and to display, for example, the shot a.od revecse-shot of a victim at her intercom and a point-of~ view shot of the intercom while sh e hears the str-·ngler's voice.

voyeuristic neighbor (Jennifer Salt) sees a murder in an apartment across the way (a la H itchcock's Rear Winbt"} and calls the police.

T he formal confrontarion benveen filmic and televisual media took a variety of forms in the l9jOS and 1960s. The expanded scope of the fum screen was an attempt to win back Yiewers from the competing format of television; the split.. screen fractures of rhe wid=.reen were filmmakers' sl't'·tegies to more fully urilhe rhe new real estate of rhe wid=reen frame. In t he same manner that films of the 1950s (It~ 11/ways Fair Wratlm; Wil/SuueJJ Sj"Jil &ck Hrmtrr?) took television as an object of mt.rrativc., films of the 196o s and [970s began to use video as M inset medium.

expansively, as video was introduced as an emerging art mediom, a wide array of video artists- Nam June Paik, Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci, L inda Benglis,
John Baldcssari, Bill Viola, Gary Hill, and others-used multiple monitors to experiment with the fracturing o f time and the multiplication of the video image." Frank Gillette and Ira Schneider's Wipe Cycle (1969), ior e.xample, displayed a wall of nine monitors with a mix of live broadcast, videotape, and closed-circttit shots of people in the gallery. Br\lce Nauman's Live-Tap<d Video Corridor (1969-1970) placed two video monitors at the end of a narrow corridor, one on top of the other. One monitor displayed a live image from a video camera at d1e entry to the corridor, while the other showed a prerecorded video from the same position. Like Sedgwick -confronting her video self in f12TJe?' and Outer Space, the two monitors enact the confrontation of video-liveness with the rime shift of video playback. Nam J une Paik's playful repu··posing of d\e '~deo cabinet led him to new configurations fOr the cathodc~ray monitor. Whether it be his interactive deconstruction of the video image with electromagnets in i'Vfagnet ~·v (1965) or the baring of the apparatus in Zwith (Tv Looki11g Glass} (1974), Paik eviscerated the materiality of the electronic image, questioning television as a disposiJif"

In the 1960s, as filmroake.rs explore<! split- and multiple-screen formats, as the
media of video and fiL n began to i!llteract as production formats, there were, at

first, only subtle changes to vernacular screen media. But as the ·personal computer" began to invade daity life, a new "interface" to the screen begao t.o produce new modt~ of cinematic, television, and video display. Tbe grapbicaluser iurerfitce (now synoptically known as out) has changed rue ""ay we usc and imagine computers. Computing mechanisms were £rst room-siud mainframes, then faceless beige boxes. As they acquired display
screens, the. computer supplied a new 61interfuc.e" with its user. 41lnterface""-a

geometric term for the.surface thrur forms rhe common boundary between two rurce-dimensional figures-was deployed to describe the human-computer relation oo.ce the user was Gt.el'l\Uy "facing" the computer. In this way, the user's relation to tl~e computer screen can be measured in terms that we}ve used tOr other screen formats-the representation of llatne. <s and depth, tbe use of the frame, the assumed ''point o{ view" of the viewer, etc. The metaphor of the win dow, so overdetermined by !he connotative drag of its cnlrural heritllge, qttickly entered inro the terminology for computer operating S)"tems, as an inevitable component of computer"architecture." BtLt here, as we enter into the discursive terrain of computers and computing, it wW become apparent that an entirely different set of terms and philosophical assumptions arc at play. Computer operat·ing systems also rely on metaphor, as if we can imagine the (umre only in rue familiar langt·age of the past. Metaphors, of course, are already translators. Metaphors substitute one
thin.g fo( another, pe.rfonning an alche.my from a mate.rial referent to the imma-

terial tissue of language. But computer metaphors are not just descriptive figures, aloft in language; they are int~gra! to tlte conversion of binary bits of information into words and images. A compu ter metaphor acquires nearmateriality as ~l v irtual object.

In the history of computing de,ices, the use of metaphor became a direct component of the gmphic display screen. In lnterfoce Cultu,.e (1997), Ste.ven
Johnson eloquently details the ways in which the graphical user interface t.mnsformed the spatial imagination. Johnson convincingly argues that visl!al metaphors (of the desktop, the window, but also of the personal assistant, shopping

pieces of design. These e-.uly compu ting appararuses were prosthetic devices, oliloading the calculations of the human br3in ro the delicate workings of a machine. As rhe m:lchinery of computing grew to room-sized mainframes, the human user was dw·ufed by the sheer scale of rhe m achine. Contact wirh these
ga:rganruan mach.ines became an awkward interaction via knobs and diaJs, plugs and circuits, punch-tapes and punch-cards. One way to conceptuafue the changing "interface" with computi ng machinery is ro consider the barriers between humans and machine. John Walker,

CHAPTER 5

'The exact origin of the. first use of the renn ''window· as a mewphor f<>r >10 inset fi:-.tmed section of the computer screen is difficult to pinpoint. Douglas Engelhart may not have used the exact rerm "window" ro describe his multiplescreen "-rv approach'~ to the comp\lter iuter('l.ce, yet his 'Augmentcd Human l nreUect Study" contained a prototype for the form. In a r962 project description, "Augmenting the H uman Intellect? A Conceptual Framework," Engelhart declared his EnlightetUnent goals for the computer: "By 'augmenting human intellect' we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a comple.x problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his p<>rtic1llar needs, and to derive solutions to problems:·.. As Engelb:u·t summarized some of the coo.dusions to be drawn from his study: "VIle see t he quickest ~s emerging from (t) gi1·iug rhe human the minute-by- minute services of a digital computer eq~>ipped with computer-driven Cllthode-ray-tube display, and (2) developing tb.e new meth.ods of thinking and working that allow the human to capitalize upon the computer's help!'"' To illustrate computer-aided "intellect augmentation; Engelhart supplies an example that uncannily draws us back to Alberr.i :Uld his 1452 architectural treatise De re nedifoatorin (On the Arc ofBuilding). Engelhart imagines ao architect designing a building at a computer workst-ation. The system imagined has "a visual display screen some three fC:!.et on a side" which is his "working surface." The.display screen is controlled by a computer ("his 'clerk") chat the arcbitCC! runs "by mc-.tus of a small keyboard and various other devices." Engelhart describes the architect's WOJ'k pcocess, which begins wim a "perspective view": "he bas just coaxed the clerk to show him a perspective view of the steep hillside building site with the roadway above, symbolic representaliions of the.various trees dtat are to remain on the lot, and the service tie points for tlte different utilities. view occupies the left rwo-d> irds of d1e screen. With a 'poinrer,' he indicates c:wo points of interest, moves his left hand mpidlyover the keyboard, aud the distance and elevation between the points indicared ap·pear on the rigbt-haod third of the sc.ree1 \."91 The."pe.rspecthr eview" occupies only a portion of the scre.en; the.other portion dL·pla)'S specifications of distance. and ekvarion. As the.architect's work · proceeds, he enters specifications for the building using a keyboard and pointer: "Now he enters a reference line with his pointer, and the keyboard. Gradually the screen begiJJs to show the work he is doing (a neatexcav:ttion appears in the hillside) revises itself slightly, and revises itself again. After a moment, the architect changes the scene on the screen to an overhead plan \~e.w of tbe site, stiU showing the e."\:cavation.'19l The perspective viev..- undi.fl:ereuciated from its Renaissance forebear-shifts witb the stroke of a lirtgt.r to an overhead view. The huagi·\ed depth of the screen surf.\ce, deep toward a v:>o.ishing point at one moment, shifts

to d1e fiat surface of the view from abo\·e. Prior to Renaissance perspective, painterly representation did not in1ply a sing\Llar fixed point; the view was from both above and below. \>Vhile the exact details of the screen and its component portions are not described in Engelhart's 1962 proposal, IUs intentions for what he would call a "Tv approach'' to a multiple- screen display are prototypically clear. E ngelhart worked on tb.is interface through the mid-196os, b\lt his ninetyminute multimedia demonstration of uerworked computing at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Fr;uJcisco on December 9, 1968, was to the computer window what the Lumiere brothers' December 28, 1895, showing at the Grand Cafe was to the cinema: ;t pro,·ides a dramatic markable date, more symptomatic than exact, and only to be qualified by corrections and cxceptions. 9' F ilm historians debate the "first" public projection of moving images: was it the Lumiere brothers' scientific demonstration in March rll<)s, or their December r895 showing at the Grand Cafe; o·r the November 1895 public projection by the Skladanosky brothers at the Winter Gorden in Berlin? Equally, the computer graph.ic display window was demo11strated in a \'llricty of venues, all of which are described with a dramatic weight equivalent to the writing of protocinematic history-Engel bart's r968 display at rhe Fall Joint Computer Conference, Charles P. Thacker's April ·973 demo of the Alto at Xerox P.,_ R c, Steve Jobs's 1979 visit to Xerox PARe, the r984 Super Bowl ad that introduced th e Apple Macintosh. In the report that aecomparued the r96S demo, E ngelbart describes the components of his displa)' system . He emphasizes the limitations of the system (he used small black-and-white Cl<Ts), but also defends the cost features of this
"TV approach":

E ngelbart does not use the term "window" in this description of the r968 demo- only the retrospective ac 'COunts do. lnt Howard Rheiugold's description of £ngelbart's 1968 show, for example, Rheingold uses the word: "The screen could be divided into a number of'windows,' each ofwhich could display either g information displayed oo the !.rge screen, acti text or image. The changio. V'ated by his fingertip commands on rhe five- key device ancl his motions of the mouse, began to animate under Doug's control."" lt is not clear whether the term ~window" was actuaUy used at S J U or whether now, in rc.cove.rcd mc.mory, the inset screen was belic'Ved to always already have been a window. But after Engelhart's demo, there is a cl<'llr instance in which the window metaphor was invoked. In bis 1969 dissert ation at the Uruversity of Utah, Alan Kay described a graphical "object orientation system" that had "VI f. W and '\,~Noows""' The flgure of a "viewport" is only slightly dif'l'erent from a window and could equally have become tbe proprietary trademark. Both imply an aperture, a visual porthole onto the graphic e.xpanse of a screen that simulraneously represents and masks dte workiltgs of the computer's code. In this form of "object- oriented" programmirtg, anythi ng could be an object- .>

number , a word, a picture-and hence it was assumed to be a multimedia dis-

play. Kay imagi ned the computer as just such ·a meta medium able to incorporate other media, a convergence de.vice \\"'.Uting to happen. As computer operating systems were developed dtro\·gh d1e 1970s and into the 198os and as the "'personal"computer was tna.J'ke.ted as a COilSlLfl'l et ·tppliance.! the use of a screen was not an immediately apparent advance. While other corltemporancous developments (the military roots of ARPANET and the cvcnrual Internet) were expanding the potentials of networked communjcation, the emerging conventions for computer djsplay took place in the laboratories of corporate research aud development.91

In April1973· the Alto compllter was demonstrated to a group of researchers
at Xerox

but not yet a window. The Alto was an in-house computer at PARe, not released to the market. But the competition with old media was clear; to viewers accustomed to 7omm widescreen films a.nd colorful h.igh-resot.. tion television images, the computer display was sti.lla di m relative. The Alto screen was shaped like an upright letter-siud piece of paper, so the implicit metaphor of this interface was that of typing onto a page. Other members of the PARC group were dlevcloping crucial components of what would become a display screen with inset "windows.""' l n 1975, Dan Ingalls wrote a display algorithim that provided tbc means to move whole rectangles of bitmap from one location to another. "BieBlt" (au abbreviation for bit boundary block transfer) became the root algoritbim for overlapping "windows": part of the screen could be hidden by a block that appeared on top of it, as if the screen dis· play had layers. Not only could the screen be divided into seplU'Ote movable inset frames, but each one could run a different application-one displaying a r.ext program, one filled "~th pure code, one with a drawing. The. overlapping window changed the metaphor ever so slightly. The surface windowpane now had depth and defied gravit)l since windows could also be stacked. The user would manipulate from a p<>sition as if in front and also above. The window interface did, however, rely on the idea of a dynamic square- a resizable, dr<~gable, motile frnme, with a scroll bar to navigate within its boundaries. The computer window is like a screen where the con rent'S move but the &am e.stays stable. The graphical user interface developed at Xerox PARC emphasi·ted tlte metaphoric nature oi computer usage-"mice" that scurry under our fingers at the fltud command <>f wrist a.nd palm; "desktops" that defy gravity and transform the horizontal desk in to a vertical surface with an aJTay of possible documents and applications; "icons" tltat represent objects or, more exactly, object-oriented tasks. This interface became known as the W!M P interfaceWindows, Icons, Mouse, PuU-down Menus."' The bitmap screen introduced a new layer to the user in terf':lce. In the graphk interf.u:e, the user dire,ctly manipulates a virtual version of what she intends to command-the usc.r selects, drags, drops, opens, closes, copies, deletes, puts in the trash. Tbe user can see the documents and applications on the "desktop" and in the "windows" of the screen. By contrast, the user of the "command Une" inte.rface may be "conversing" with the computer, giving it commands tO perform a task, but she must speak to it in its code. Instead of translating a three-dimensional material world to a two-dimensional virtual representation as painters and photographers and filmmakers have done, tl1e bitmap cornput· er display constructs its virtu:U world cr.tltcly ft< un digital in for-

mation. The bitmap screen performs a different translation: from the nondirnensional immateriality of bits to a visual (graphically iconic) mapping of metaphor onto the virl\1 aliry of a two-dimensional screen. The computer "window" referred to any e nclosed, rectangular a.re11 on a display screen. In a l98· book l'ri11cipln oj"Computer Graphics, the "window manager and the t.erm "window" were nonproprietary idioms: ''1\1-.my system and user progr:.uus on the A vro employ a window manager to control multiple, typically overlapping windows, i.e., areas on the screen in wbich a page or piece of a page maybe displayed. Each window is in essence a .-.triable-size virtual. screen that reflects the progress of some activity. The general eftect is one oflooki ng at a small desk with papers of varying size lying partially on t.op of one another."""' T he "window" here refers to a "variable size Yirtual screen" but is also a component of a mixed metaphor: a window and a desk. The desktop metaphor of a stack of papers, in o'·erlapping array, implies a view &om above. T he. window metaphor impUes looking into or out of an apc.rture, a .:~perspective" position. F..ci ng an upright perpendicular surface. Stackingwiudows on top of each other, piling documents in layers, meant that the user CO\tld maximize tbe limited "real estate" of the relatively small screen. The space mapped onto the computer screen was both deep :tnd flat. It implied a new haptics in the position of irs user: in front of and aboYe. T he window-based interf·ce allowed !the user to Of>eo more thau one window, introducing the concept of multiple tasks, appucations, views to the computer user. .,A computer is jusrone machine," writes Yale computer scientist David Gelermer, "a screen is a single plot of real estate, but windows allow you to create as many coronmnication channels as you cho<>sc bcn"'een yourself and your running program."101 In December ·979· Steve Jobs-the twenty-four-year-old cofounder of Apple, tbe. manuf·cn 11er of Apple I and Apple II personal computers-visit£d Xerox PARC. Apple II Md Commodore home computers both were configured to use TV screens as monitol's. The 1981 1BM PC used a m.ooochr o m eCR'I' sc.reen bur not C UI display. Retelling the import ofJobs's tom of Xerox PARC wirh the full narrative intrigue of industrial espionage, Michael Hilt'i<ik describes Jobs's visit as a "daring raid.'""' (According to another writer,Jobs traded $1 million in stock options in Apple for the visit.)'"' At Xerox PARC Jobs saw the graphical user intertace nsed on the f\Joo and t.he Star. The GUI-run Xerox Star was introduced to the market two years latec, in t981, but its price was too higb for the home computer market. Jobs used both the Alto and the Star as models for the 0 1983 Apple Lisa,1 ' the first persomd compU!tCf with GUI. Althot1 gb the Lisa

I n a now-historic.sixry-second spot, plac.ed during balf-tirne. of Sup.er Bowl XXL on January 2 2, 1984, Apple unveiled its new computer, the Maciutosh.'05 The ad, produced by 1.21 Screen shot of Apple Lisa, ·98J.

With this dramatic introduction, the Apple Macintosh triggered what Neal Stephenson deemed a "sort of holy war in rlte computer world.""" T he M aciOltosh, priced at a much more reasonable h,495, was a personal computer with an operati11g system based on graphic display instead of the "comm:md line"

PROPRIETARY W I NDOWS

I n his 1995 memoir, 1'he R(}ad Ahead, Bill Gates recalls the transition from the command l.ine to graphic ~nterface. Gates describes his intention, as early as 1983, to develop graphical interfAce and to abandon Ms-oos: "Our goal was to create software that would <!Xtend MS - oos and let people use a mouse, employ graphical images on the computer screen, and make available 011 the screen a number of 'windows; each nlwling a difterent cor n.p"t.ater progr:-am. "107 In G ates's account, the other lWO personal computer systems that had graphical interfaces in 1983, r.be Xcrox Star and Apple Lisa, were propr ietary and expensive: "Microsoft wanted to create an open standard and bring graphical capabilities to any computer that was running Ms-oos:·ull< Despite rhe rhetoric of

And as the media-santratcd cantpaign for \· Vindows 95 emphasi-zed, by the end of its first de-cade, Microsoti's W indows became the most widely used operating system."" As David Gelerntcr writes; "Pushing beauty instead of old-fashioned oos ugliness, Microsoft emerged as the uncontested! leader of the desktop com· pu.ting world."W Like the lVIac os, rhe "interfi1 ce" ofVVindows extends screen space by overlappjng screens of varjous sizes; each "window" can run a different application;

che user ca.n scroll through a tcxtwithio a "window," arrange "windows" on the screen in stacked or overlapping formations, decorate "windows" (with wallpapers, textured patterns), and conduct new forms of '\··in dow shopping.·m The '\vindows· trope is emblematic of the collapse of rhe single viewpoint; it relies
on themodel of a window that we don1t see through, windows that instead over-

lap and obscure, and are resizable and movable. Consider the following shift in discourse from the Albertian metaphor. Webopedia, an online dictionat)' of new media term.s, defines "windowft as distinctly polyscenic: An enclosed,,rewmgular area on a display screen. Most modem operating systems aud applications have gmpbieal ·user iuterf.!ces that let you d;vide your display into several windows.

Before Microsoft adopted a graphical user interface for its Windows operating system, the "holy war· between t·he MAC and the Ms-oos ·command line" interface was described by Umberto Eco as a struggle between lVlacintosh/ Catholicism ("the essence of revelation is dealt with via simple formulae and sumptuous icoos") and Ms-oos!Protestantism ("To make the system work you need to interpret the program yourself: a long way from the baroque community
of revelers, the user is dosed "~thin the loneliness of his own inner torment"). uo~

pares the Macintosh and Windows interf.tce: the. Macintosh is "not only a superb piece of engineering but ao embodiment of certain ideals about the use of technology to benefit maukiud," while Microsoft's Windows equrV'3Ient is "a
pathetically clumsy imitatio n and a sinister world domination plot rolled i1l tO

14 And yet, despite the competition between the l'vlac and vVindows operone."1 ating systems, Stephenson holds both systems ac<x>untable for millions of computer users becoming accustomed to a graphic.-.! interface."' By mapping code onto a graphic displ:>y, the GU I interface conceals its workings, b.ides its code. In Stephenson's account, the gn~phieaJ interface "introduced a new semiotic Jayel· between hum an and machine: uGOls use metaphors

to make computing easier , but they are had metaphors~ 08 Stephenson com-

pares this to the D isney model of "putting out a product of seamless illusion." (Stephenson's diatribe c-arries with ir an implicit critique of icon-based graphics as reductive cartoons.) Iu this ·way, botb the Mac and Windows operating systems are in the same business: that of "short-circl·ir.Ulg laborious, explicit
verbal communication with expensively designed interfaces."lt' Alte.rnativeJy)

Stephenson champions the Li ntLx operating system because its workings arc. exposed and it can be customized by its user, like a tuner-car. An obvious ana)ogy occurs bere: both dle Mac os :and Wwdows inre.rface operate like. classical Hollywood film style-couce:tli.ng its workings, airning for unre8exive illusionism-while the Linux os operates more like an independent or avM t-garde

film, self-reflexive, its S11bsttatos and premises exposed. The Linux os is compu6o.g with distancia6on, as if it were an operating S)e;tem designed by Bertolt Brecht.

Immobile, wlth atte.ntion f(>cuscd on a screen, the "user" interacts directly with the framed screen image using a device-keyboard, mouse, or in the case of touch-screens, finger- to manipulate what is contained within the parameter of che scceeu. Computer intertilces may have been designed to become dyadic partners in a metaphysical relationship, bt~t complaints about the. awk-wardness of this liaison have targeted the interf:tce.

For Alberti, the metaphor of the window implied direct, veridiC1ll, and unruediated vi..slon> transparency of surface o r ape .rture, and transmitted light. T he

computer "window" implies its opposite: the visual field seen through a computer 'window" is rarely direct (although webcams p.lay on this fi.mction); it is mediated to a high degree through its proprietary or trademarked "software'; and its representatiooa.l function is h.igbly iconic. Computer "windows" coexist on the flat surface of a computA:r display. They open onto A atness or depth, image or te..xt, moving or still conre.nt. Som;e "windows'' open onto networked systems, some only refer to the hard drive of its base. Although computer "win-

i..'iows" can be "open"' at the same time, they rarely serve, as the art historical
double-slide ptoje.otion did, as a mea.ns for co>up;~rative analysis. So let's consider the compute. r usc.r who navigates the."windov.rs"' of screen space. In the mixed metaphor of the computer screen, the computer user is figt·ratively positioned with mul6ple spatial xelations to the screen. "Windows" smck i11.frf!n/ · ?/each other (if one is looking into the screen perpendicularly, as if through a window} or on "'fifeach other (ifone is looking iuto the screen as if its perpendicular is in a gravity-defYing nillet)'-degree rotation of an angle overhead). fu either a "page" or a "window," a mobile switch of position
is implied in the mixed metaphor: the user switches between a recumbent (desktop view} ;md an upright (window) view. The desktop metaphor implies

the desktop, but this doesn't mean the program isn't there or is no longer active. The computer may be "thinking" about several things at once, it may have sev· era! applications op;:u, different programs running in separate "windows." · Of course, the icons of the graphical user interface are reductively simple, far from high art, further even from the screens of popltlar culture. T he Microsoft version of the window interface did not even draw on the "deep beauty" that David Gekrnter finds in software that is "simple and powcrfuL."W And yet, on the fractured plane of the computer screen, the metaphor of the window has retained a key stake ;n the technological reframing of the visual field. The Windows interface is a postcinematic visual system, but the ''iewerturned-user remains in fi·onr of (vorstelkn) a perpendicular frame.

-W:'lltc.r Benjamint "The VVotk of Arr U\ che Age of Mechanical Reproduction"

Iu au oft-cited passage from "The Work of An in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," \'lalt.c.r Benjamin draws a distinction between the modes of "receptiOn1J of painting, film, and architecture . .:.:Painting invites the spectator
to contemplation/concentration," Benjamin explains, while "Architecture has

always represented tbe protot)'pe of a work of art the reception of which is con· summated by a colle.:tivit)' in a sta~e of distraction." The film meets this mode of reception "halfway."'23 Architocrural theorists have often bridled ar Benjamin's dismissive g:eneraliz:ttion about the experience of architecture and, equally, film theorists have debated this assessment of the film spectator. But
"reception in a state of distraction'' now seems to provide a prescient mode) for

the multitasking computer user. For cinema spectators, the conventions of film narrative and the protocols of tlleatrical e.xhibition encouraged cognitive foct·s and engagement. {SpectaCHA J >T ER

tors who eat loudly, make out, talk on their phones- or othen.~se multi taskare tatgets of social opprobrium.) Although the instances of split-screen and multiple-screen filmmaking described at the beginning of this chapter suggest that the film spectator was increasingly equipped to engage "~th such ITactures in attention, tclevisual spectatorship much more directly encouraged the habits of a split-attentive viewer. The television's domestic site encouraged housewives to iron and fold laundry in front of the set, families to cat dinncr witb the TV on in the background, children to play with toys while watching cartoons. Channel switching, aided by accessory devices like the remote, implied dle inherent potential co engage in a "mode switch." By contrast, rhe computer user must engage with the computer screen dir:ectly, as it only responds to the user's interactive "input." Yet the computer user can- and easily does-split focus and attention to multiple tasks, since compute rs can now routi.ne.ly run multiple

applications: , each open in a diftCrc.nt window.
Multiple "windows" made computer "multit-JSking" possible. "'' As one Web dictionary defines "mt~titasking," it is · worki.ng with various computer programs ar one time in order to increase your prod.u ccivit}' and reach your i.ureuded goal."125 The windows interface made it easy for the user to switch back and forth between two documents or two applications. In order to theorize the subjective consequences of computer multitasking, we need to first consider the tcchn.it'.U base of m<~ciple-screen "windows." For a computer to multirask, the computer does tasks not simultaneously but serially, and yet at a high speed. (Even a slow computer w.ith a hundred- megahertz processor can e.~ecute a million instructions between each pair of keystrokes.) W hile a computer microprocessor can keep many programs running at the same time (parallel processing), the user still "crosscuts" between one or more programs in selective sequence. Just as the insrrume1 \tal base for the moving image-the retinal rete.!ltion of succe.-sive virtual images-produced a newly virtual representation of moveme1\t and a complex new experience of time, the instrumental base for multiscreen OJ<Lititasking poses new questions about the computer user's experie nce of time.

253

Computer multitasking makes it possibne to combine work with leisurcnmu.iug an E><cel spreadsheet wh.ile checking email or shopping on eBay-and hence serves to equate productivity with a fractured subjecrivity.u· A 1998 New York Tim<s article reported the following statistic: "Microsoft says the average office user of W indows 95 has more than three programs running at a time. At home, more than 10 million }\roe.rican households now bave a television and a personal computer in the same room."12' Screen-based multitasking is only one fo·m of multitasking. Using multiple screens (computers and Tvs) or engaging in multiple activities (talking on rhe

Tll'& M ULT IP L&

phone while "watching" TV) bas extended the meani ng of "nmltitasking" to a mo· 'e pervasive cultural mode. In asn·dy of American leisure time habits in zooo, < Ul MTV Networks/Viacom Study of Media, Entertainment, and Leisure T ime reported d1<tt Americans spend tin1e v.~tb media and euter~ainmenr 4·7 hours a day. For 2.9 of dtose hours, the aver.age American simultaneously reads magazines and watches 1.' V, listens to cos and sends email. T he. r esu.lts, the. study reports, imply that a multitaskc-.r's ave.rage .day has 29.8 hours of acr jvity.118 However, as another critic assesses d1c psychic: liabilities of technologically enabled multitasking: "Technology didn't give us more time, it just upp<:d the e.xpectations of what we could do in d1e same tim·e:' 129 As a further indication of the effects of ·m~titosk.ing on styles of learning and thinking, consider the following advice on time management offered to college students:"]VIulti-wi.udow, multi-task activity is the norm for roda/s studeots. E -mail, g-...nes, and web searches are routinely managed simwtaneously with writing papet-s or completing research assignments. Srudents have learned to \·.Uuc the pace. and accessibility of 'i deo presentations and sound-bite synopses of popular culmre. The slow, linear process of reading a book or attending a lecture may challenge astudenr's time management skills and attention to detail. Whae mult.i-msking can be a vah·able tool, so are fOcused attention and concentration. All are required for success in coUege."W A George \~'ashington University website offers the following recommendations:
JVIulti-window, multi-cask activity breaks concentration and consumes time rapidly. · Turn off or minimize y<)Ur pop up wjndows. Avoid screen dutter and eliminate distra.c tions. · Bre~k msks into manageable time blocks and stick to d1em. · PL' n rbe hours ofyour d ay (or study p<:riods) iu advance.

· l'vbke allowances for periods of relaxation. · Exercise and strengrheu your ability to sustain concentration and absorb information by gradually increasing yonr srudy time and e.ffort until you reach an established goal. · Create a variety of study aids to help focus your attention (e.g., index cards, tables, diagrams.) · Aliow time. to stop and think about connections among course materials, f. 1cts, and findings.1:n

This discussion of multitasking implies the direct cognitive cffc<:ts of multitasking behaviors. Is the fractured subjectivity of multitasking in service of productivity and efficienc)·? ls it a mode of technologically enhanced labor-saving to r the "human motor"? Docs the liberatorv rhetoric associated with multitask' ing (you <.an work where you want; take your compu ter to the beach or rhecafe) merely mask the increased expectations of ~4/7 productivity? (Do you really want your laptop at the beach?) Just as "alibi servers" help to e\Oide surveillance, euacting a redwolog. ical illusion of being elsewhere, computer "windows" can be alibi servers tor ideutiry: L1Lift tm the Screen, Sherry Turkle describes how computer windows work to produce ao identity with "distributed presence": ":VVindows provide a way for a computer to place you in several contexts at the same time .. . your identity on tl:te computer is the sum of your distributed prcsc.ncc."JJl Turkle portrays the. computer user as a ('decentralized selfJt who, cycling between different windows, has a fractured but multiple identity. w She ascribes this screen life its theoretical analogs:

[M)ore than tweuryyears afrer meeti ng the ideas ofLacan, Foucault, Deleuze. , a.od Guatcari, I am meeting them again in my nt""'' life on the screen. But this time the Gallic abstractions are more concrete.ln my compurer-mediated worlds, the self is multiple, fluid, and constituted in inter.lctioo with m<lchine cono.ec6ons; it is made and transformed by lang<·age; sexual congress is an exchange of signiiiers; and understandi ng foUows from navigation and tinkering rather than analysis. And in the machine-generated world of MUDS, I meet characters who put me in a new relationship with my own identity."'

I ···

fu a screen -based visual system, the "windows" interface subtly exponentiates what Erwin Panofsky described as the "unique and specific possibilities" of the cinema: the dynamization ofspace and the spa.tildizllti"'n ofi'ime. On the computer, we can be two {or more) places ~u once~ i.o nvo (or r note) rime frames, in two (or more) modes of identity, in a fractured post-Cartesian cyberspace, cybertimc.

sual, and compur.er screens have vanished.l3-$'l"elevisions have.become more like computers: hard-disk video recorders (D\' RS such as TIVO, Replay TV) record television signals onto an auxiliary hard-drive; HDTv-ready TVS use chips running mega- MtPS. Conversely, computers have become more like televisions: MPEG arld QuickTime "mo,·ies" and "streaming" videos ftash across and tbcough Web browser pages. Networked multimedia home stations (Microsoft's X-box, Nintendo's G.tme C ube, Sony's Playstat.ion 2) combine the functions of telephone, television, and gaming console with the computer, and further confow1d the technical differentiation of film, television, and the. computer. The segregation of histories of telephony, moving-image, and computing technologies appears- in postrnillennial retrospect- to have been a set of arbitrary separations that disregarded the intermedW complexity of technological development. To write a "history" of these n<>w media formations is to encounter many familiar historio-graphical challengesY' As Stephen Heath warned in an earlier historical moment (1978), when the "cinematic apparatus" seemed a dominant technological form: "1echnological determinism substin·tes for the social, the economic, the ideological, proposes the random autonomy of invention and development, coupled often with the vision of a fulfillment of an abstract human essence-and some of the wildest versions of tlus latter are to be found in accounts of the (then aptly named) 'media: ... [Cinema's] history is a history of the rechnological and social togetl1er, a history in which the determinations are not simple but multiple, interacting. in which the ideological is there from the start."1>? \Vhile caa-eful not to overstate the determinations of t.echnological development, Heath and other apparatus theorists attempted to provide an account of the technological and social specificities of tl1e cinema as a single medium. In this way, we may wish to regardMar·shall McLuhan as the fitst apparan·s d1eorist. Back in 1964, when McLuban proclaimed, "the medium is the message," his sound-bite aphorism drew attention-not only to the mediation that the media implied, but also to the specificity of each separate medium. McLubaninveighed against a content-based study of the. media: "Tbe 'content' · of any medium;' he writes, "bliods us to the characteristics of the medium."'" Instead, McLuhan prescribes an analysis of tl1e effect.s- "the change of scale or pace or panern"- that each particular medium might prodttce. \'Vhile M cLtthan analyzed the interrelatedness of media in an evolutionary scheme ("The. contc.nt of any mediwn is always anothc.r medium»), 1311 he also insisted
CHAP'r ER

that each new medium would " 'institute new ratios, not onJy arnong our private senses, but among themselves, when they intc.ract among tbem selves.n1~ How, t'heu> do we account fOr the uut:\Y ratiosn produced by the rapid and recent
cltanges in the screens and interfaces of moving-image media? Nicholas Negroponte, :~nother M cLnhan -styled media prognosticator, offers a countecpolem.ical aphorism, turning McL,,J,an's "The medium is the message" on its head. Negropoute declues: "The medium is nor the message in the digital world. It is an embe>diment of ir. A message might h.:w e several embodiments automatically derivable rrom rhe same data."" ' For Negro ponte, digital technology dissolves the specificity of individual media: digital imaging, delivery, aud display etiectively er:~se tlte messages implicit in the source mediwu. Negropoure proclaims: "The basic difference between today's Tvs and PCs has nothing to do with loc:<tion, social habits, or our need to relax. It has to do with how the bits arrive."'" If we foU o·· Ncgropoure's axiom ("the medium is not the.message in the digital world")) we arrive at a newfound dete.rminjsm: digital wctmology inherently im plies a convergence of aU media forms. Ge!'man media theorist Frie<irich Kittler anticipated this loss of media speciJi.city when he wrote (in t986), "The general digitali:tation of information and channels ernses the difference between individual medi:t.""' Yet Kittler predieted that the installation of fiber- optic cable-and not me phone wu·es or the Internet or tbe. wireless fu ture of the Web- would be the technology to turn .film, televisio!~·· music, and phone. calls into a ''single medium." The changes in screens and Ollf "interfuces" with them have oc~'l>rred at the speed of fast-forward. But have the screens of cinema, television, aod compt·ter really lost their apparatical distinctions? A recent sales website fo r tlat-sc!'eeu monitors conflates the multiple functions of the screen-'rv, movie display, Internet browser-now displayed within the same electronic pi.cture frame: Hanging on a waU they look more like art rad1e!' than a TV set. \ ¥heo you' re not watchi ng Tv, ovo videos, surfing the ner or reading your e- mail, there is no need to switch the plasma panel off. It can be used as an electronic picture frame~ with a continuously changing selection of artworks of your choice: An endless art collection!'" Or, as rhe Consumer Electronics Association predicted in zooz:

Auguries of convergence always suggest a teleology: some media are seen as ttansitional) while others see.m desti ned to evolve into the uext species. A media paleontologist could examine tbe fossil remains: the VCR may h<tve bcgtul to erode the diff:Crenccs between tclevisual and dne.matic vieniog; the ovo may have became the delivery format to serve the displays of computers and televisions alike. New-generation gaming consoles offer features that include. ovo players, output jacks for Htn·v, broadband connections, and hard drives for storing music and games. W hile newer iterations of the gaming console seem poised to further bridge t.he gap berween rhe digital world of the personal computer and the analog world of television, one cannot predict what delivery or display format will sun·ive the vicissitudes of the consumer market. There. have been earlier attempts at marketing d1e convergence of television, computer, and cinema screens that tailed. In ' 993· Apple introduced the "Macintosh -rv," a convergence appliance that anticipated a l1 ybrid computer·user/televisionvlewc.r who would use cl1e sa.me CRT screen as a television receiver and computer display. But Apple decided the market wasn't. there: the Mac TV was discontinue.d almost before it began.1'' ln 1996, "\~1eb-r v," an Jnternetappliancemarketed to users who might want to access the Web on their television screens, iolagined a convergence that }))passed the personal computer. Tbc convergent screen of Microsoft's x P Media Center is positioned ro fulfiU these earlier promises. 'I1le television sct-een {big screen, plasma screen, vco screen) is now coequal with the pixels of computer "display." ''Nt.·v/ ' media imply the eve.r-obso!cscenoc.of the "old., As Antonio Gramsci put it: "the old is dying and the. new cannot be. born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appe-ar.""' And yet, amid these morbid symptoms, the continued engagement with a ''virtual window" seems somehow assured.

Now, a variety of screens- long and wide and square, large aud small, composed of grains, composed of pixels, lit by projected U ght, cathode-ray tube, plasma, Len- compete for our attention without any convincing argmneots about hegemony.

Griffith's prediction capwred an insight about his centus)?s "new" technology for storing time, yet he imagined a "properly adjusted window'' as ideologicaUy transpasent-he did not acknowledge any mediations to the "history picture" it would record. Alberti's fifteenth-century metaphor of the window served to frame the geometric, geophysical world, arranging the above., below, ahead, and behind on the flat fmmed plane of representation. Alberti's window was not a transparent "window on the world," but it provided us with a Renaissance root for a "windowed elsewhere"-a virtual space that exists on the virmal plane of represeomtion. In Alberti's schema, there was no absolute size, only proportions relative to the human measure: "Large, small, long, short, high, low, wide, narrow, light, dark, bright, gloomy, and everything of the kind [magmun, parvum, lcngum, hreve1altum, · inji· mum, latun1) a. 1·r.tttm, darum, ohscu.rum, !uminosum) tetubro.sum et hu£uJmorli omm1. which philosophers tcn·nerl accidents, because they may or may nor be present in rhing~. all these are such as to be known only by

T he screens of the twenty-first century are large, small, long, short, higb, low, wide, narrow, light, dark, bright, gloomy, artd known by their relative measure to the buman scale. And yet, as the dis;play screens of movies, television, and che computer begin to grow more similar to each other, a new logic to fr:lmed visuality rakes hold. The windo"'s metaphoric boundary is no longer the singular frame oi perspective-as beholders of nmltiple-scrcen "windows," we now see the world in spatially and tem porally fractured fumes, through "vir-

As time wore on and the technological Sllllpsbor of the present kept changing, 1 fou nd it necessary to add richer historical and tl> eoretical detail, taking some steps backward from the digital present to detail how the P'·st presses its nose up ag-Ainst the glass of the future. But this book was also written in an era of"posts"-the post- to modern.iry, the post- to colonialism, the post- to the millennium, the post- to 9/n-as if d> e present can be understood only as an epilogue itself, an end.iog after the end. We can know the past only in terms of how it has been constructed fo r us, in terms of how e··ideuce appears to us now, mediated through the lenses of the present. This book has tried to provide <U> account not of how we got to here, but of whe('e we~ve come from. When 1 wrote Wi11do.v Shqppiug, I wanted to 31"[\'Ue l10w deeply movingimage media had permeated our cons<:iousness, how they had changed our access ro history and to the past. ] argu·ed rhat postmodernity could be understood only as a consequence of the creeping centra1ity ol mediated modes of visuality and in terms of the virtual mobilities in everyday life. 1 offered an account of subjectivity-a temporally confused subjectivity- in the mediasaturated firs t world, a world where the commodit)' fetish set the rule of culture. But tbe ·mobili'<ed and virtual ga-<e" was not- <md iJ not- the global norm. Nor are there easy generalizations to make about consciousness itself. An individuafs relation to space and to time is mediated by a range of determinantsincluding geographical place in the w<>rld, access to media, religious belief, psychological state. Tbis book, like Windqw Shopping, attempts to provide ··~ account of the subjectivities of people in the most mediated provinces of the first wodd. 1 have been drawn to philosophies that attempt to coocepmalize the ways in which our bodies and m.inds move and think in the everyday. T he drives of tcchnophiliaL ust for efficiency, mobility, accelerated modes of experience- produce changes that are both gradual and dramatic. Yet these changes require chat we confront the sad truth of their price- a consequence that has been termed a "digital divide" but is less about the digital chan about another more deeply rent divide. AU agonistic accounts require a theory of rupture., an account of the break. T he coUa.pse of the World Trade Tow. e rs provided a dramatic visual turning

point, a break that fo rced a change in all accounts of the interdependence of global and technological change. The dlsintegration of two massive towers of glass and steel had an explosive epistemological charge. As the writer A. M . Homes recounted in tbc New Y<>rk Times: "I see the plane, and I see the plane crash into the building. I see the buildings burn, and I see the buildings fall down. I see imagery that until now did not exist in reality, ooty in the fiction of film. Seeing it with yotrr own eyes, in real time- not oo a scJ"een, not protec -ted by the fnuneof a television set, not in the communal darkness of a movie theater -seeing it like this is irreconcilable, like a hallucination, a psychotic break."' A. M. H omes w-·s unprotected by the frame or by the screen. \~1hile many wished that the images of <j/n were only a movie or television special effect, the towers of glass and steel remain only in the immaterial archive of memory and in the archive of photographs and films that retain them. The film remains after the building fades: t he ephemcrol materiality of the Twill Towers-and the lives extinguished inside them -has been imparted to the arcb.ival immateriality of photographic, filmic, and television images. In many ways, this implosive inversion of our technologies- aircraft turned into missiles against buildings on our own shores-is more and more

Chemic:al agents can be sent through the postal system. D iseases can cross borders and refute the metaphors of quarantine. The only way to counte. r tbe rhetoric ()f fear is to dc:x::onstruct it, to teach cynicism and doubt and critical reading. Here, I've struggled to add an appropriate epilogue to this book, one written from the cusp of new realizations about how the frame fu nctions, about the coUapse of borders and boundaries, and about how mobility has changed its valence. As a book- wciter at the end of the twentieth century, I found that my writing process was facilitated-or perhaps hindered- by word- processing software that encouraged holding· each chapter open in overlapped windows, with easy "copy" and "paste" changes made without regard to lioe·r logic. Computer-assisted writing is fu rther enabled (or d isabled) by the easy switch between the deep desktop of "ofliline" appGcations and "ontine" sources with search engines and text archives available on the very same screen. T he. blank "page" is now an upright screen, but not a blank screen. It bas toolbars and desktop icons and many "windows."ln fact, one.of the inset frnrnes on my computer screen contains a little Microsoft .ma.,cot-an inset "window" chat opens to a c-artooned computer with its own belly- like screen-{! foggy blne eyeball in the socket of a monitor with feet.
