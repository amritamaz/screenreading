	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p> This project was born out of a desire to find our bearings within the texts. After a semester of learning, understanding, questioning what it means to read and write in the digital age, where are we? What have we taken from cultures and technologies past and what kinds of open problems are we not yet solving? Lofty goals for a 30% assignment, I know, but a more approachable synthesis of these questions still stands: what can we learn with new tools and a bunch of texts? what can we learn from them, from the tools and the books and the amalgamation of the two?</p>

	<p> What follows is a brief exploration of our semester, applying screen reading techniques to a syllabus of seminal texts on screen reading. We first explore the low-hanging (but still enlightening!) fruit of frequency counting, apply this analysis to our notion of keywords, and then consider the dichotomy between print and screen texts and its impact on this analysis. We also cover a brief overview of the tools used in this analysis, and their potential side efects on this discussion.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="freqs">
	<h1>Word Frequencies</h1>
	<p> When tasked with the question: what did we actually learn?, my first thought was to see what ideas appeared most frequently in the texts. The assumption was that by finding most common words, we could uncover the most common ideas.</p>

	<p>After compiling the database of texts in the syllabus, counting common words was simple enough. The result, however, was a list of words and their frequencies - not the most useful way to understand the results. I decided to filter out all stopwords (common words such as 'a', 'the', 'etc', etc.) and any parsing errors resulting in one- or two-letter words, then plot them as a percentage of the total word frequency (sum of all frequencies of all words). For clarity and sanity's sake, I only plotted the top 30 words.</p>
<div class="pics">
<img src="img/freq1.png"><br />
</div>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> Well, it appears 'new' is the most frequently-used word with 56% of the popular vote! This makes a decent amount of sense. In a semester of readings about the history and trends of book publishing and writing and reading, it would be logical to see the word 'new' used frequently. </p>
<p> More expected and understandable is the word 'book' coming in at second place. Considering most of the texts concern reading, writing, and everything in between, the book is certainly a logical second choice.</p>
<p class="aside">Aside: It is eerie how much frequency-ranked lists of words resemble minimalist sentences. "New book like also even read text first world." It would be an entertaining exercise to try to make a summary-generator by just filtering out stopwords and sorting by word frequency. Maybe a Twitter bot.</p>
<p> This analysis leans closer to disappointing with regards to its results (I probably could have told you 'also' was a popular word, and wonder why it is not considered a stopword...), but is also indicative of a larger frustration in digital analysis - not being stupid enough for a computer. The human act of skimming, picking out the important words and phrases and immediately gleaning the bits most salient and words most relevent is a task a computer cannot easily do, as my 5 hours and many broken programs can assure you. Moreover, the patterns you may eventually get may tell you less about your problem than you could have expected - what does it mean that 'world' is such a popular word? How does that fit into my preconceived understanding of the focus of the semester's readings? Was the class secretly focused on global texts and I missed it? Or is the use of 'world' meant to evoke how dramatically the state of the book is changing, that it digital technologies are increasingly universal in scope? Questions beget questions.

<p>
To confirm my process was correct, and to do a more micro analysis on some of the my perceived most definitive texts of the semester, I also graphed the word frequencies of Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media', Jerome McGann's 'Radiant Textuality', and Franco Moretti's 'Graphs, Maps, and Trees'. On a smaller body of work, the most popular words turn out to be more indicative of a text than on the larger scale. What also stuck out to me was how infrequently a word needs to appear in a text to be considered frequent. Out of a 2,000 word essay on media, one only needs to mention the word 'media' 40 times to beat McLuhan for presence.  </p>

    </section>


    <section id="incommon">
	<h1>Keywords</h1>

<p>
A more fruitful analysis might be to use humna-generated words to conduct my analysis with. Conveniently, us students were put to task identifying and explicating a set of 'keywords' from the semester, and I used these pre-defined words to track how the keywords manifested themselves and interacted across the weeks' readings.
</p>

<div class="pics"><img src="img/keywords.png"></div>

<p> First, a discussion on how this graph was developed is in order. This was a topic of contention within myself - I envisioned it as a set of bar graphs with best fit lines squiggling around, showing the rise and fall of 'print' as 'interface' surges forward. <br /><br /> This was not the case.</p>

<div class="pics"><img src="img/keyword_bad.png"><br>(this is unhelpful)</div>

<p> So, another approach had to be taken. After experimenting with all the graph types available, I settled on a stacked area chart. According to Apple's Keynote documentation, "stacked area charts show the magnitude of change over time, and they display both individual values and the sum of all values in the chart." Perfect. On my charting tool, it insisted on adding up the percentages to 1000%, which I maintain is impossible. In any case, the y-axis indicates how popular the keyword was as a fraction of its most popular week. Weeks where the graph veers downward in all colors indicate that no keywords had a strong showing that week.</p>

<p> While the chart is fairly straightforward, there are a few limitations to this visualization. Because the areas represent fractions of a whole, the word 'colophon', for instance, barely appeared 6 times in its most frequent sources. This presence appears in as large of an area as 'book''s 60-word showing in its less popular texts. This proportionality problem proved too difficult to solve at this level of analysis, but is something to consider when understanding how words appear and are presented in visualizations.</p> <p> I also wondered about the peak and fall-off, and where that arose from. The answer, it turns out, has less to do with the content of the text but its manifestation (see: next section). </p>

<p> What this chart had elucidated to me was a key assumption I had hidden from myself, even throughout
